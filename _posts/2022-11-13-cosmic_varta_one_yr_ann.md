## Our Story

**Astronomy and Astrophysics** as a subject has the potential to remove the barriers between people and unite them in a hope of understanding the cosmos. However, even though cutting-edge research is being carried out across India, a communication gap exists between the researchers and the younger students as well as the general public who may not be familiar with the technical details.

In the hope of bridging this gap, came together a group of enthusiastic PhD students from various research institutes across India and **CosmicVarta** was born.
