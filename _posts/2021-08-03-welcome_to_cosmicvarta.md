# What is CosmicVarta?

Astronomy is truly a global subject. The boundaries between the nations, people, ethnicities do not exist for  astonomers. We all think of the entire humankind as one.

However, India is a country where astronomy is equated wih astrology by even the well educated individuals. This itself is a paradox, as the Indian civilsation has a rich history of astronomical observations and calculations (expand). It becomes necessary and a responsibility for profesional astronomers to present a platform where the authentic research being carried out is presented and discussed in language which a 'non-expert' individual can understand. Moreover, while high quality research is communicated through the  reputed journals, the students who are not dealng with he subject on a day to day basis might find it diiffuciut to grasp. We present **CosmicVarta** as an online platform where we simplify the current astronomical research being carried out so that people from every background can grasp the essence of the results.

We are a group of Ph.D students, who all are working towards our doctoral thesis and through this platform, we want to share the astronomical  research being carried out by the Indian astronomers scattered all over the country. Another area where we'd like the users to utilize this platfomr is: career guidance in astronomy.

Research in astronomy is pursued at only a handful of research insitututes, hence prospective studens may often find it challenging to find relevant information. Through this portal you may find information regarding the various career optiona available, various positions available at astronomy institues in india and the other necessary information.

This portal will also serve as a information hub regarding various softwares and databases that are available to be used by the public for free. We can even help students who are  looking for short term projects using such huge volume of data by connecting with the scientists working actively in that area of research.


Come join us on a journey which will take yopu the wonderful world of stars, galaxies and beyond; and feel enthralled by unlocking of the keys to the mysteries of the universe which the scientists are doing on a daily basis.
