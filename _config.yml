        description: "I am currently working as a postdoc at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ). I completed my Ph.D. from Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), India. During PhD, my main research area was focused on star formation, especially identification and characterization of young stars. After exploring various star-forming regions and the associated young stars in optical and near-infrared wavelengths, I am currently working on the same field in radio wavelength, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)."
