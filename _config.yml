      description: "I am Suman, Ph.D. scholar at CHRIST (Deemed to be University). My area of research is the observational and statistical study of emission-line stars to investigate the circumstellar surroundings, disk dynamics, variability. Recently we have identified and described a rare set of candidates in a transition phase from classical Be (CBe) star to Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) star (Bhattacharyya et al, 2021). Apart from all this as a pastime, I like to do sketching, reading, and cycling."
