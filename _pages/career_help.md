#### Want to pursue a career in astrophysics?
Well... astronomy and astrophysics is an exciting branch of physics isn’t it? There are plenty of options available for young people willing to choose a career in this discipline. While in India, there is not much emphasis on astrophysics as a subject right until you graduate, a wide variety of options open up after it.
During MSc., some universities have the choice of astrophysics as a specialization. Some universities provide an option of joining the various research institutes for the final year dissertation project. Places like IIA, IUCAA, ARIES, etc., offer people the opportunity to conduct short term projects in associations with a faculty member.
After MSc, if one is interested, one can apply for a Ph. D at these institutes. A Ph. D is the highest academic degree one can obtain and from hereon the formal work of an astrophysicist starts.

#### Want to pursue a Ph. D in astronomy in India?

If yes, this is the right place to seek the information about these things. We list all the institutes offering a Ph.D in astronomy and astrophysics in India.

#### ARIES, Nainital
Situated adjacent to the picturesque hill town of Nainital, ARIES (an acronym of Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences) is one of the leading research Institutes which specializes in observational Astronomy & Astrophysics and Atmospheric Sciences. The main research interests of Astronomy & Astrophysics division are in solar, planetary, stellar, galactic and extragalactic astronomy including stellar variabilities, X-ray binaries, star clusters, nearby galaxies, quasars, and inherently transient events like supernovae and highly energetic Gamma Ray Bursts. The Institute hosts several telescopes. The unique geographical position of ARIES (79<sup>0</sup> East), places it at almost in the middle of 180<sup>0</sup> wide longitude band, between Canary Island (20<sup>0</sup> West) and Eastern Australia (157<sup>0</sup> East), and therefore complements observations which might not be possible from either of these two places. ARIES has made unique contributions from time to time.
More information about the institute is available <a href="https://aries.res.in/" target="_blank">here</a>.



#### IIA, Bengaluru
The Indian Institute of Astrophysics is a premier institute devoted to research in astronomy, astrophysics and related physics. It traces its origins back to an observatory set up in 1786 called the Madras Observatory. Today, the institute has observing facilities at Kodaikanal, Kavalur, Gauribidanur and Hanle. The main campus is located in Koramangala, Bengaluru.
Funded by the Department of Science and Technology, the Institute ranks as a premier institution devoted to research and education of astronomy and physics in the country. The Kodaikanal Observatory has for over a century been the principal centre of activity in observational solar and atmospheric physics. The Vainu Bappu Observatory at Kavalur has been the main optical observatory of the Institute for night-time astronomy since the late 1960s. There are several telescopes in operation here, the foremost among these being the 2.34 metre Vainu Bappu Telescope. The Gauribidanur Radio Observatory has a decametre wave radio telescope array and a radioheliograph. The new high altitude Indian Astronomical Observatory (IAO) at Hanle in south-eastern Ladakh has augmented the facilities for nighttime astronomy. Here, a 2 metre Himalayan Chandra Telescope was installed in 2001. A seven-unit High Altitude Gamma Ray (HAGAR) telescope is in operation at the Hanle site. The Bengaluru campus has an extensive library, a computer centre, physics laboratories and electronics, photonics and mechanical laboratories supporting an active instruments development programme.
More information about the institute is available <a href="https://www.iiap.res.in/" target="_blank">here</a>.



#### IISc, Bengaluru
The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) is a premier institute for advanced scientific and technological research and education. The Department of Physics at IISc offers a prestigious Joint Astronomy Programme (JAP) - a programme for training PhD students in astrophysics, jointly run with several collaborating institutes within Bangalore such as <a href="http://www.rri.res.in/" target="_blank">Raman Research Institute (RRI)</a>, <a href="https://www.iiap.res.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA)</a>, <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/" target="_blank">Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</a>.

#### IUCAA, Pune
The Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) is an autonomous institution set up by the University Grants Commission (UGC) of India to promote the nucleation and growth of active groups in astronomy and astrophysics at Indian universities. IUCAA aims to be a centre of excellence within the university sector for teaching, research and development in astronomy and astrophysics. IUCAA’s activities fall under two broad programmes: core academic programmes and visitor academic programmes. Core academic programmes include basic research, the PhD programme, advanced research workshops and schools, the giant metre-wave radio telescope and guest observer programmes. Visitor academic programmes include the visitor and associates programme, refresher courses for teachers and helping the nucleation and growth of astronomy and astrophysics at Indian universities.
More information about IUCAA is available  <a href="https://www.iucaa.in/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.


#### NCRA, Pune
The National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (NCRA-TIFR) is the premier institute for radio astronomy in India, and one of the best in this field in the world. Research activities at NCRA-TIFR are centered on low frequency radio astronomy, with faculty members carrying out research in a wide range of areas, including solar physics, pulsars, active galactic nuclei, the interstellar medium, supernova remnants, the Galactic Centre, nearby galaxies, high-redshift galaxies, fundamental constant evolution, and the epoch of reionization. NCRA-TIFR has built and operates the largest steerable radio telescope in the world, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, as well as the Ooty Radio Telescope, and offers challenging opportunities to work at the frontiers of astronomy and astrophysics, as well as in instrumentation development.
A detailed description of the areas in which research is underway at NCRA-TIFR can be obtained <a href="http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### PRL, Ahmedabad
Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) was founded in 1947 by Dr. Vikram Sarabhai. As a unit of the Department of Space, Government of India, PRL carries out fundamental research in selected areas of Physics, Space & Atmospheric Sciences, Astronomy, Astrophysics & Solar Physics, and Planetary & Geo-Sciences. The Research in the Astronomy and Astrophysics Division involves investigations in the optical, infrared, X-ray and the radio wavelength bands to understand some of the outstanding problems related to galactic and extragalactic cosmic phenomena, such as star formation, stellar evolution, interstellar medium, binary stars, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and giant radio galaxies.
