Be it the database from the Sloan Digital Sky Surey, to the upcoming facilites, a lot of data and the tools to acces them are publicly available nowadays. We just attach links to a few of them, so that interested people may keep a track of them. Of course, members of the **CosmicVarta** team use a lot of these sofawres and databases on a uusal basis, toards their Ph.D degrees! If you have any problem, you may ask us through the forms available in the [contact](/contact) section, or even in the comments section below.
