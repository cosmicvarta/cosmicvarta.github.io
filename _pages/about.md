We are cosmic varta team. Here our mission will be posted, alongwith our motivations.
This is the personal profile for all the people too. We should use hyperlinks to link back to our personal pages/social media profiles wherever available.





#### Our story

We all are Ph.D students at various institutions in India. We are united by our love towrds astronomy and the need to communicate the research to the general audience. (Add some more text here...)


#### The members

Alow us to introduce ourselves ;)

 <h2> <span style="color:blue">Anusha R</span></h2>


Im Anusha. I'm currently working as a research project assistant at CHRIST (Deemed to be University). My research mainly focus on emission-line stars in general relating line properties, formation mechanism, statistical analysis depending on stellar parameters and the circumstellar environment, their disk physics. I am currently working on spectroscopic analysis of Disk forming hot stars and photometric analysis of the effect of binarity on the disk properties. Personally, I like to watch crime thrillers a lot. I'm a classical dancer and love to write.

<h2> <span style="color:blue">Gourav Banerjee</span></h2>


 I am Gourav Banerjee, pursuing PhD in stellar astrophysics at the Christ (Deemed to be University). My area of research is stellar spectroscopy, especially observational studies of emission-line stars such as Classical Be (CBe) and Classical Ae (CAe) stars. My PhD thesis aims to study (using optical spectroscopy) the variability (both transient nature and V/R variability) of selected CBe stars and also understanding the disc parameters of Galactic field CBe stars as a continuation of my MPhil thesis. Moreover, I have remained involved with other projects on similar fields such as the first systematic study to identify and characterize CAe stars (paper published in MNRAS), identification and characterization of CBe stars in open clusters older than 100 Myr (paper circulated), first ever identification of emission-line stars in transition between PMS & MS phase (paper circulated), etc. Astronomy outreach is anothe field which I love from my heart. I am associated with astronomy outreach activities across Bengal and other parts of India for the past 26 years. My hobbies are reading books (mostly Bengali literature, history, and popular science) and exploring remotest places of India and abroad (sadly that is halted now).  And yes, I am a Voracious EATER.. food and books give me pleasure, astronomy provides me mental peace.

<h2> <span style="color:blue">Ketan Rikame</span></h2>


I am a PhD student at Christ (Deemed to be University).
Field of Instrumentation has always fascinated me and it has been my primary research interest.
However, while working with various astronomy instruments, I also got interested in learning about underlying physical phenomenon these instruments try to study.
I have previously worked in optical and radio instrumentation.
I am currently part of the instrumentation team at RRI and we are building an X-ray polarimeter approved to be launched on a ISRO's dedicated satellite mission XPOSAT.
I also study accretion powered pulsars which will be one of primary scientific target of our X-RAY polarimeter.
I am very much interested in science popularization. Although not involved in any such activity right now, I love to talk to people about my research (and not bore them hopefully :sweat_smile:). I also love to listen/read about to fascinating research other researchers are doing.
I also love football :soccer:.

Hello. My name is Lakshitha Nama. I am a PhD student at Christ (Deemed to be University). My PhD research aims at understanding the relationship between magnetic field and the elemental abundances in the outer atmosphere of Sun and other main sequence stars. I make use of imaging and spectroscopic data from X-ray telescopes. My hobbies including reading and painting.

<h2> <span style="color:blue">Vivek Kumar Jha</span></h2>



Hi everyone. I am Vivek. I am a  Ph.D student at ARIES, Nainital. My research so far has been about understanding the inner regions of active galaxies.  My PhD thesis is aimed at resolving the inner (sub-parsec) regions of these objects through multi-band observations and infer the structure and kinematics of matter in those locations.  I am also interested in exploring the various all-sky surveys which provide huge amounts of data to be accessed publicly. When not doing research, I usually go trekking in the neighbouring mountains or spend some time listening to classical music. You may find more about me [here](https://viveikjha.github.io/)
