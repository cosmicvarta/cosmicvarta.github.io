  <p>Researchers from Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bangalore, report the detection of cyclotron resonant absorption feature (CRSF) in the X-ray spectrum of the binary star system â€˜Cen X-3â€™. The magnetic field of the neutron star in Cen X-3 is estimated from the CRSF. This work is a step forward in understanding the nature of humongous magnetic fields of Neutron Stars.</p>
