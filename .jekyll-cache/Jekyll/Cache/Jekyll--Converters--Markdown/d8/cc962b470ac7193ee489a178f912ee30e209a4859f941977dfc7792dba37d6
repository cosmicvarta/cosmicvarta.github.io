  <p>Space is quite inhomogeneous at small scales. These inhomogeneities may play a significant role in governing the physical phenomena at this scale. Here we have analysed the impact of these inhomogeneities on the Gravitational Wave (GW) observables. For this analysis we have made use of a toy model of the inhomogeneous spacetime. Our analysis shows that the amplitude of GW gets affected by these inhomogeneities and this effect is governed by our model parameters.</p>
