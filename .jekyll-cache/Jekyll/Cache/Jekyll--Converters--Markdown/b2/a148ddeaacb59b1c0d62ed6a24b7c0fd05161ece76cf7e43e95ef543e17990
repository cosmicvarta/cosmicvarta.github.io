  <p>This article discusses the results from our combined radio polarization and emission line study of five type-2 radio-quiet quasars. We investigate the origin of radio emission in these sources and understand what impact the local gaseous environments have on the nature of radio outflows in them. Our work further sheds light on the potential of using radio polarization as an efficient tool to look for signatures of AGN feedback in the relatively understudied class of radio-quiet AGN.</p>
