  <p>The neutron star is the most well known compact object in the Universe. It has several macroscopic properties such as mass (M), radius (R), compactness (C), tidal deformability (Î›), and moment of inertia (I), which can be observed using different telescopes and terrestrial detectors. Some of them have already been measured, and others can be done soon. However, there is another way to obtain the magnitude of such properties, which are difficult to measure using just observational techniques. One such way to do it is with the help of a universal relation between those properties. This article discusses one such relation known as I-Love-C for the anisotropic neutron star.</p>
