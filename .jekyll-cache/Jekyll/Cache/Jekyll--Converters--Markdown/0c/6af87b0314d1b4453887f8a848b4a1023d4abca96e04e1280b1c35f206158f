  <p>Blazars are a rare class of active galactic nuclei (AGN), in which the jets are pointed directly toward our line of sight, making them one of the brightest yet extremely compact sources. Relativistic effects such as beaming makes the jet emission the dominant component. Blazars exhibit multiwavelength variability across several timescales (varying from hours to years). However, the location of the emission region with respect to the central engine is an open question. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.1655B/abstract" target="_blank">Barat et. al (2022)</a> try to address this question by combining information from multiwavelength variability of a sample of 11 blazars. Comparing the energy of the detected flares in multiple wavelength bands to state-of-the-art numerical models we put constraints on the location of the emission region.</p>
