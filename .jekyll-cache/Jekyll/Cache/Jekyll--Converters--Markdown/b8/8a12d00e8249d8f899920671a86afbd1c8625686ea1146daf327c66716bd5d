  <p>A small percentage of the ejected hot plasma flows (the jets) from supermassive blackholes are observed to deviate from their intended path, resulting in unusual jetted morphologies. One of these peculiarities appears when the jet starts to dance /precess around an axis, forming curved jets with <strong>S-shaped</strong> morphology. When we observe such sources through radio telescopes, we see a massive S-like structure floating in the vast cosmos. Due to their peculiar morphology, the formation mechanism of such sources is still debated. Simultaneously, an increasing number of such sources are being discovered with even more complex S-shaped structures, making the unravelling of the underlying physics more difficult than earlier.</p>
