  <p><strong>SARAS 3 experiment</strong>, designed and developed at <strong>Raman Research Institute</strong>, has conclusively refuted the claim of detection of the signal from <strong>cosmic dawn</strong> by <strong>EDGES experiment</strong>. It has become the <strong>first experiment worldwide to reach the required sensitivity and cross-verify the claim</strong>. Given the unusual nature of the claimed signal, several non-standard cosmological models were proposed. <strong>SARAS 3 findings do not support these exotic models proposed previously. The results are now published in Nature Astronomy.</strong></p>
