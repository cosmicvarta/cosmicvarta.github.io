<h2 id="useful-links">Useful links</h2>

<p>A lot of data and softwares are available publicly for free. Be it the huge database from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to the multi wavelength dataset provided by the NASA- HEASARC, a lot of data and the tools to acces them are publicly available nowadays. Further, newcomers might find it a duanting task to search for relevant research papers in their specific areas of interest, in view of the hundreds of papers being published on a daily basis! With services like ADS it becomes an easy task. We attach links to a few of these useful services below, so that interested people may visit these URLs to gain further information. Of course, the members of <strong>CosmicVarta</strong> team use a lot of these softwares and databases on a usual basis, in their Ph.D work! If you have any problem, you may ask us through the forms available in the <a href="/contact">contact</a> section, or even in the comments section below.</p>
