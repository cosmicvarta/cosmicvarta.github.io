  <p><strong>CosmicVarta</strong> celebrates its <strong>first birthday</strong> today! Hurray!
It was a wonderful year indeed.
Today, we take a look back at our journey and briefly talk about our future plans.</p>

<p><strong>Astronomy and Astrophysics</strong> as a subject has the potential to remove the barriers between people and unite them in a hope of understanding the cosmos. However, even though cutting-edge research is being carried out across India, a communication gap exists between the researchers and the younger students as well as the general public who may not be familiar with the technical details.</p>

<p>In the hope of bridging this gap, came together a group of enthusiastic PhD students from various research institutes across India and <strong>CosmicVarta</strong> was born.</p>
