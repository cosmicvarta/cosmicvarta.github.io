  <p>The interstellar molecular clouds are the high-density regions between the stars having elements in the molecular phase. These clouds usually come up with different structures based on the influence of nearby massive ionizing stars. Also, these stars can either hinder or trigger the star formation in the molecular clouds. The ambient magnetic field towards these clouds also found to regulate the star formation and structural evolution. In our work we study the magnetic field structure (projected on the plane -of-sky) of a molecular cloud shaped as a comet in the Orion region of the sky. We found the evidence that the magnetic field is dragged away by the pressure of the nearby massive ionizing source and shaping the curvy structure of the cloud.</p>
