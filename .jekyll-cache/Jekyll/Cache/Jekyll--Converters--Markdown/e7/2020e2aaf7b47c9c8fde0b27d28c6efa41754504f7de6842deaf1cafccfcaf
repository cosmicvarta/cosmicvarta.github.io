<p>We study how galaxies and other sources in the early universe change the neutral universe or InterGalactic Medium (IGM) into the ionized one. We compare different kinds of source models and how they ionize the neutral universe which mainly consists of neutral hydrogen. We trace the largest ionized region formed by these sources by using a statistic known as the Largest Cluster Statistics (LCS). We found that LCS of different source models evolve differently and hence show different natures of ionizing photons or sources. We also investigate the geometry and topology of these ionized regions and how they are different for each model.</p>
