  <p>During astronomical observation, astronomers measure the amount of energy emitted by astronomical objects. This energy is generally measured in terms of the flux density of the source. At radio frequencies, these measurements are calibrated using calibrator sources, which have known constant flux densities. Since the Sun is about 1000 times brighter at radio frequencies than the calibrator sources, estimating the flux density of the solar radio emission is challenging. With the new generation radio telescope, the Murchison Widefield Array, it is now possible to observe the faint background radio sources simultaneously with the Sun. This is the first such an observation has been made, which seems like ‚Äúobserving stars in the day‚Äù. Using these background radio sources it is now possible to estimate the flux density of the solar radio emission with much better accuracy, which is important to understand the emission mechanisms of solar radio emissions.</p>
