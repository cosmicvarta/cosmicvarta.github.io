  <p>We Indians celebrate <strong>National Science Day</strong> on <strong>28th February</strong> each year to mark the <strong>discovery of the Raman effect</strong> by <strong>Sir C. V. Raman</strong>. Some of Ramanâ€™s discoveries like the <strong>Raman effect (for which he was awarded the Nobel prize), Raman-Nath theory, his studies on Brillouin scattering, the soft mode process</strong>, etc. are so well known and outstanding, that they tend to overshadow many of his other elegant and significant contributions to the science. We attempt to highlight a few of Ramanâ€™s discoveries such that they <strong>portray a more complete picture of Sir C. V. Raman and his contributions</strong>.</p>
