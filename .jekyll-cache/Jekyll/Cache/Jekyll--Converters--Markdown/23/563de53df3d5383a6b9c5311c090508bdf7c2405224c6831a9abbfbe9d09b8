  <p>Space vehicles are propelled by rocket engines that generate thrust by expelling exhaust at extremely rapid speeds. As Newton‚Äôs third law states ‚ÄúFor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction‚Äù, the engines help to accelerate the rockets forward by the effect of the thrust. Interestingly, we can see a phenomenon similar to the motion of a rocket in the sky. The dense and cold molecular clouds are found to show the rocket effect in the presence of the nearby massive ionising stars. The ultraviolet photons emitted from the massive stars ionise the surfaces of the surrounding molecular clouds facing the stars. The hot and ionised material tends to photo-evaporate away from the clouds, accelerating them in the opposite direction, similar to the motion of a rocket. In this work, we found evidence of the rocket effect in several bright-rimmed clouds in the plane of sky.</p>
