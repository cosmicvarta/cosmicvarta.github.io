  <p>Ionospheric irregularity studies are important aspects for understanding ionospheric physics and related processes, especially near the low-latitude regions. This work, for the first time, shows the nature of the ionospheric irregularities present during these observation days and sets a path forward for further studies of the other scintillation causing irregularities over the dynamic low-latitude regions of the globe. This work is beneficial to the space physics community and pertinent to the radio astronomy community, where understanding the nature of the ionospheric variabilities and their corresponding mitigations becomes important for fruitful astronomical studies of radio sources.</p>
