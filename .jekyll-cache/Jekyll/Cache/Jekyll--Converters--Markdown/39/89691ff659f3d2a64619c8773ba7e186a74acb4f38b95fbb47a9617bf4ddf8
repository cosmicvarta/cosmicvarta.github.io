  <p>This article is based on the paper published in the Journal of Astrophysics &amp; Astronomy. The article shows the results of our deep optical photometric observations of a young cluster NGC 1893 taken with the 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope. Based on the optical data obtained with the data along with the Gaia data, we characterized the young stars in the central region of the cluster and determined their age, mass and membership. We found that the distribution of masses of young low-mass stars in the cluster is similar to that of other Galactic clusters.  Our analysis suggested a primordial mass segregation in the cluster.</p>
