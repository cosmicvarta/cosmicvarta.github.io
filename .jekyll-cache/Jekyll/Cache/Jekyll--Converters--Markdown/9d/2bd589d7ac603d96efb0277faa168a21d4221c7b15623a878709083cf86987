  <p>Light when seen correctly provides rich information on what happens in the cosmos. In this article, we showcase our work on identifying signatures of the solar wind in the solar chromosphere â€“ far lower in the solar atmosphere than what has been expected. We take the reader through our analysis, interpretations and speculations on our observations, and present a unified model of solar wind emergence and the heating of quiet corona.</p>
