  <p>Galaxies reside in the deep potential of invisible matter called dark matter. Their dynamics is significantly affected by the distribution of dark matter around them. Distribution of dark matter around galaxies is usually known as dark matter halo. Most of the previous studies of galaxies assumed spherical dark matter halos. But, cosmological simulations of structure formation suggest that the dark matter halo can vary in shape. It can also have non-spherical shape (e.g. oblate and prolate) which can significantly influence the evolution of the galaxy. In this study, Astronomer from IIA, Bangalore and SJTU, China have studied the effect of non-spherical dark matter halos on the buckling of the bars and formation of boxy/peanut shape bulges. They perfomed a set of numerical simulation for varying dark matter halo shape and traced the formation of bars and boxy/peanut shape bulges.</p>
