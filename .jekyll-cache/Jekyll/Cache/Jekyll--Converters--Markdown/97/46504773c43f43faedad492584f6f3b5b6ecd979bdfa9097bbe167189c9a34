  <hr />
  <p><strong>‘Cen X-3’</strong> is a binary star system observed in the constellation <em>‘Centaurus’</em>. It is one of the most luminous X-ray sources in our galaxy and the first-ever X-ray pulsar to be discovered.
Scientists from the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune present the <strong>new measurements of spin and orbital parameters of ‘Cen X-3’</strong>. The results are crucial in <strong>understanding the life-cycle and evolution of X-ray binary systems</strong>. The work is published in the <em>‘Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy on AstroSat: Five Years in Orbit’</em>. Researchers used the data from the <strong>Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters (LAXPCs)</strong> onboard <strong>Astrosat</strong>, for the analysis. <strong>Astrosat</strong> is India’s first dedicated multi-wavelength space telescope launched by the <em>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</em> in 2015.</p>
