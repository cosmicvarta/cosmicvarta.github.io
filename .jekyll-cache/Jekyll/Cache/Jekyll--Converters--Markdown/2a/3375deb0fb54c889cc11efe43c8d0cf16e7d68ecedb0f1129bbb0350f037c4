I"Ž<p>The outer atmosphere (the corona) of the Sun poses a long standing mystery regarding its tem-perature.  The solar corona is composed of plasma (ionised gas) that emits strongly in X-rays andultraviolet radiation.  Its temperature exceeds a million degree kelvin, while the visible surface (thephotosphere)  is  at  6000K.  One  of  the  theories  to  understand  the  so-called  â€™coronal  heating  prob-lemâ€™ proposes the occurrence of a large number of small scale explosions (known as microflares andnanoflares) on the Sun.  It is known that these flares are a manifestation of the magnetic field of theSun that is generated in its interior.</p>
