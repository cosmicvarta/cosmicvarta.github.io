  <p>As the saying goes, ‚Äú‡§® ‡§ï‡§Ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡•ç ‡§∂‡§æ‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§§‡§Æ‡•ç‚Äù (lit. Nothing is permanent), and hence the nature of this universe. The ever-evolving twinkles in the starry night are also non-discriminate towards this concept. If a star is born, it ought to die. Supernovae  are cosmic fireworks that do not require any occasion (e.g., New Year or winning a football world cup!) to explode. This explosion is the terminal stage of stellar evolution. Therefore, we can say that supernova is the death of a star that sends a siren to the universe in the form of gravitational waves to radio emissions (one of the best candidates for multi-messenger astronomy).  We study one such demise in detail.</p>
