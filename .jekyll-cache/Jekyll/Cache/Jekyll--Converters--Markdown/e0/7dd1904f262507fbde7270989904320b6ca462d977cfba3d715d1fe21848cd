  <p>AGNs are very luminous objects at the centre of active galaxies. The inner regions of these galaxies can not be resolved directly, yet the understanding of these regions can be achieved by employing indirect methods. In this study, we employed a statistical approach to understand a very peculiar class of AGN with respect to the general AGN population- the Narrow Line Seyfert galaxies, and have found out that emission line region outflows exist in the innermost regions of these AGN which adds another peculiarity to their behaviour.</p>
