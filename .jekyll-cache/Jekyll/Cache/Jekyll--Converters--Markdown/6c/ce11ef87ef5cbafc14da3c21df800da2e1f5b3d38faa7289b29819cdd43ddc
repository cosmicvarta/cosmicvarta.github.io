  <p>The article discusses the structure of the neutron star crust. In the neutron starâ€™s crust, exotic structures commonly known as â€œnuclear pastaâ€ are believed to exist. The pasta structure impacts various structural, thermal and transport properties of the crust and therefore needs to be investigated. Using a simple nuclear model, the present article estimates the content of pasta structures in the crust and its implication on the neutron star properties.</p>
