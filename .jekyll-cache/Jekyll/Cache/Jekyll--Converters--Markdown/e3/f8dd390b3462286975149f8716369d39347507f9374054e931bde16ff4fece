  <p>The focus of this article is solar wind. I first take the reader through the theory &amp; observations, and various properties of solar wind. Then, I take a detour through machine and deep learning which form the basis of our work. Finally, I take the reader through our work on predicting, and investiagting sources of solar wind using deep learning.</p>
