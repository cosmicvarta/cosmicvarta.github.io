  <p>The study of the cosmos is only complete when we can receive and analyse data from the entire electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from picometer-sized gamma rays to several meters long radio waves. This realization is what led to the advent of multiwavelength astronomy. But even in todayâ€™s era when technology has paved the way for us to observe the sky in a very wide range of wavelengths, it still remains poorly explored at wavelengths greater than a few tens of meters. This is mainly because the Earthâ€™s ionosphere blocks most of these wavelengths. Even if we could observe them, it would require us to build a telescope several kilometres wide to properly resolve the sources, which is physically impossible. This article is a review of a journal paper that tackles these issues by proposing to simulate an Earth-sized radio telescope. The paper dwells into some technical details on how we can achieve a radio telescope larger than the size of the Earth and discusses the advantages such a system would offer. This article tries to simplify the concepts involved, and introduce the readers to an exciting new domain in radio astronomy.</p>
