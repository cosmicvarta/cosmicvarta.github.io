  <p>Most of the massive galaxies in the Universe host a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at their center. A minority among them are known as active galaxies and host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). These AGN are believed to be powered by the accretion of matter onto the  SMBH and the emission from such accreting systems can have important effects on the host galaxy.</p>
