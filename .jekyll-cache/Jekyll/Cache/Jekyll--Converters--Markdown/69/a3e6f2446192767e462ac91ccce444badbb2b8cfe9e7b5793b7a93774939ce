  <p>Being involved in research means dealing with a lot of papers on a day to day basis. Be it reading them, organizing them, or referencing them we often face a perilous task. A collection of scores of pdf documents scattered here and there in multiple folders is not something unheard of. Often we spend a lot of time looking for a particular part of the text from a paper but unable to locate it. While writing papers, and searching for references Iâ€™ve seen a lot of people doing it manually which is a waste of precious research time.</p>
