        <title>Understanding the emissions in Black hole binaries</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Yash Bhargava from Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, takes us through the journey of the death of a star in this wonderful article about his work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand what I do, I will have to take you on a journey of what happens after a star dies. Yes. Stars also die. Depending on its mass and composition, a star can die either by blooming into a red giant and then dispersing its external shell to leave a bright core at the centre, known as a White Dwarf, or by a gigantic explosion which can typically outshine a Galaxy - leaving either an extremely dense ball made almost entirely of Neutrons (also known as Neutron Stars) or an enigmatic Black hole at the centre. It becomes more interesting if the original star was already revolving around another star also known as the companion star. If the companion is close and large enough, the compact star (either White dwarf, Neutron star, or Black hole) is in a position to capture material from the companion.
When matter from the companion is captured in the gravitational well of the compact object, it doesn’t simply fall towards the compact object.  The matter would have an initial velocity which would force it to go into an orbit around the compact object. After a huge number of collisions, a fraction of matter would eventually form a disk around the compact object, something similar to the Rings of Saturn but with a tiny but very important twist. The matter in this disk is actually moving inwards while the particles in Saturn’s ring are orbiting the planet in a very stable manner. Hence these disks are called accretion disks. As the matter moves inwards closer to the compact object, it releases the gravitational potential energy. The closer the matter can get to the compact object, the more gravitational energy is available to be released. The conversion of the gravitational potential energy in the disk is a very efficient mechanism making these sources extremely bright. 
 The amount of energy being expelled is quite large, which raises the temperature of the matter so much that it emits radiation peaking in X-rays. Observing X-rays from ground-based observatories is impossible as the incoming radiation is blocked by the atmosphere. Thus scientists have sent many observatories to space to observe and study these enigmatic sources. One such observatory is AstroSat, which is India’s first multi-wavelength mission. It has 5 co-pointed instruments onboard to probe different properties of the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black hole Binaries are systems of binary stars in which the compact object is a Black hole. As compared to Neutron Star and White Dwarf, Black holes are more dense and compact, thus presenting a deeper gravitational potential well. Close to the Black hole, the extreme gravity, and relativistic effects dominate. Thus these systems are excellent laboratories to probe extreme conditions that are impossible to recreate on Earth. They also show very unique features which have not been completely understood to date. One of these features is a Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO), which is like an oscillation with many close-by frequencies occurring simultaneously. In contrast, many Neutron star binaries show pulsations that correspond to the rotation of the Neutron star and have only a single frequency, thus making them a great clock. The origin of QPO is quite uncertain as some observations indicate that it is a geometrical effect while others imply it is a resonance feature. Previous studies have indicated that the QPO might be related to precession in the accretion disk. But no single model can fully explain the properties of QPOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

The plot shows the power density spectrum, which is the square of the Fourier transform of the intensity variations with time (often called the light curve in the astronomical community). The QPO is highlighted as the grey shaded function. The features at harmonic frequencies (twice &amp;amp; half the QPO frequency) can also be seen.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of my research, I have studied different Black hole binary systems which have provided valuable insight into the dynamics of accretion disks. One of these systems, MAXI J1535-571 is quite intriguing. It was discovered in September 2017 and was one of the brightest objects in the X-ray sky when it went into an outburst. AstroSat stared at the source for 5 consecutive days and using the instruments on board we have a unique insight into the source. We have modeled the energy spectrum (which is a count of how many photons of different energies are we seeing) of the source using the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) and the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC), which tells us that this source has a high-temperature accretion disk and a cloud of electron which intercepts some of the energy from the disk and then scatters it to higher energies. The cloud of the electrons can be characterized by the slope of the high-energy spectrum seen by LAXPC. We find that during the observation, this slope is not constant and fluctuates about a mean value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/blackhole_emission_yashb/image3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 3: The X-ray spectrum of MAXI J1535-571. The emission from this source can be characterized by the multi-temperature accretion disk and Compton up-scattering of the accretion disk photons by a thermal cloud of electrons. The total emission was absorbed by neutral Hydrogen close to the source before reaching us. The emission from the Compton up-scattering of the photons depends on the electron temperature and the optical depth and manifests itself as the slope of the spectrum.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAXPC is a high time resolution instrument and allows us to measure when a photon strikes the detector with an accuracy of 10 microseconds. Thus we can determine if there are any fast oscillations occurring in the source. In this particular case, we see a very prominent QPO which also changes its frequency about a mean value as the observation progresses. We also measure the total output of the source which is dependent on the total accretion rate of the system and we find that it is increasing as time progresses. Models of QPO predict that, typically, the peak frequency of a QPO is linked with the accretion rate; as the accretion rate increases, the QPO frequency also increases. We find that for this source this is not the case for at least the duration of our observation. We see a very strong correlation between the variation in the QPO frequency and the spectral slope indicating that the origin of the QPO is tightly linked with the component responsible for shaping the spectrum. Whenever the QPO frequency increases the slope increases and when one decreases the other is also seen to decrease. These results led us to conclude that the QPO is closely tied to the cloud of electrons instead of the accretion disk where the previous theories expect it to arise from. This work questions the existing models of QPOs and accretion and demands the revision of long-held ideas.
This work and observations like this provide us with a window into a tiny region, extremely close to a Black hole that cannot be yet imaged with the current technologies. Only recently, scientists were able to combine the observations from radio telescopes across the world to create the first picture of a much larger black hole at the centre of the galaxy. But to understand the environment around a black hole in a binary system, indirect measurements (like the work described here) using the spectral and timing properties of the source will remain the primary method of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Anyway the plasma moves - it does really matter!</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Light when seen correctly provides rich information on what happens in the cosmos. In this article, we showcase our work on identifying signatures of the solar wind in the solar chromosphere – far lower in the solar atmosphere than what has been expected. We take the reader through our analysis, interpretations and speculations on our observations, and present a unified model of solar wind emergence and the heating of quiet corona.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: This article is a follow-up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmicvarta.in/solar-chromosphere-spectral-lines-vishal&quot;&gt;“Understanding the solar chromosphere through spectral lines”&lt;/a&gt; (which I shall henceforth call #A1) written by yours truly. While I have presented a summary of the previous article here too, possibly you would enjoy reading them together better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light, as we have seen in #A1, encodes in it information regarding the world. It is especially of great help to astronomers in figuring out what-where-why something happens. For those of us folks who study the Sun, we are bathed – or rather, burnt crisp with light. And so, light or photons carry with them information regarding various aspects of different regions on the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we have seen in #A1 that each element, or ion has a characteristic fingerprint in the form of “spectral lines”. The properties of these spectral lines depend on the plasma properties where the particular ion is present. Critically, it depends on the local temperature, density, velocity, and any other turbulent flows present in the plasma. These show up as effects on the line intensity, the line “shift” and the line width. And so by “reading out” these spectral lines, we can get an estimate of how much plasma is present, how fast it is moving, and in what direction it is moving – at the very least!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solar atmosphere is composed of the photosphere (at ~5500 K), the chromosphere (at ~10,000 to 80,000 K), Transition region (TR; ~1,00,000 K) and the corona (&amp;gt;10,00,000 K). The rise in temperature with height of the atmosphere is the rather much debated “Coronal heating problem”, which presents more questions than answers&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The corona then extends outwards as the streaming solar wind, with plasma moving at great speeds outwards from the Sun&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The exact reason(s) behind the large temperature of the corona, and the height (or the layer of the atmosphere) from where the solar wind starts are not known well, and are an unsolved problem in solar physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In #A1, we attempted to understand the underlying cause of these two problems in tandem by studying two regions called the Coronal Holes (CHs) and Quiet Sun (QS). The CHs are regions seen as dark in the corona against the background QS - see Fig. 1, first panel. However, if we go down to the TR (see Si IV in the same figure), or chromosphere (CII or Mg II k3), these differences vanish! Since the CHs are well known sources of the solar wind, studying these two regions together, and investigating where (and how) this differentiation starts can give us hints on resolving the coronal heating and solar wind emergence problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/vishal4_plasma_moves/image1_plasma_moves_vishal.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Fig. 1: Fig. 1: CHs (dark) and QS (bright) in the corona (AIA 193 Å), TR (Si IV) and the chromosphere (C II, Mg II k3) with the two regions demarcated by light green contours.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In #A1, we had studied the C II 1334 Å line - which forms in the upper chromosphere - in CHs and QS as a function of the underlying magnetic field. The general idea was to check if and how these two regions are differentiated depending on the underlying magnetic field. Our results in #A1 told us that QS is brighter than CHs only if we account for the underlying magnetic field. Similarly, we also found that plasma is both preferentially moving towards, and moving away from us (of course at different places!) in CHs, when compared to QS. This motion (and so the velocity) was found to be larger for regions with stronger magnetic fields! Such a result is counterintuitive – the CHs are known to be the source of the wind which travels towards us. Then why do we see the plasma strongly moving away from us? With this backdrop, let us dive into what other ions in the solar atmosphere tell us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us proceed systematically here - we are seeing some “anomalous” results in the C II 1334 Å line: a line that forms in the upper chromosphere. A simple way forward would hence be to check the properties of other lines which form in the same region of the chromosphere. And so, we performed the same analysis on what are called Mg II h and Mg II k lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mg II - Magnesium - is an awesome atom from which one electron has been removed. The transitions of this atom give rise to what are commonly called the h and k lines. Why do I call it awesome? Because the Mg II h &amp;amp; k lines are very complex – so complex that in fact they can give us the velocity of almost the whole of the chromosphere! If our results in the C II 1334 Å line were correct, they must be seen in what is called the ‘k3’ part of the Mg II line3. However, we also need to have a comparison against some “expected” results. For this, we performed the same analysis on the Si IV 1393 Å line – this line forms in the TR, and so will give very different dynamics when compared to C II or Mg II. Let us look at the results below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/vishal4_plasma_moves/image2_plasma_moves_vishal.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Fig. 2: QS-CH differences as a function of magnetic field (|B|) in the TR and chromosphere. The intensity ratio is depicted in panel a and velocity differences in other panels. Panel b depicts the difference in average velocity, while panels c &amp;amp; d show for the blue- and red shifted pixels alone. 
Image source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11668 &quot;&gt;Vishal.U et al., 2022 &lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fig 2, I present all the results we find for Mg II k3 and contrast them with Si IV. The way I present it is as follows: for the intensity, we are only interested in the “factor” by which the intensities are different, while for the velocities we are interested in the differences. The dashed lines depict the intensity ratio of 1/ velocity difference of 0 – i.e, case where no differences are seen. 
From Fig. 2a, the QS shows more intensity than CH - the factor is more than 1. This ratio is larger in Si IV (TR) than in Mg II k3 (chromosphere). This result is consistent with what we expect from physics – as we keep moving above in height, we will keep seeing QS becoming brighter than CH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fig. 2b, we check what the average velocity looks like. In the chromosphere the average CH-QS velocities are similar, while in TR the CH is less redshifted. Hence, we clearly see that the solar wind signature is starting to be seen in TR, but apparently not in the chromosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fig. 2c, we consider only those regions where plasma is moving towards us. Clearly, we see that the CHs have plasma moving much faster towards us than QS. The difference in velocities is also larger in the TR. This is in-line with our expectation of plasma moving towards us in CHs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally in Fig. 2d, we consider only those regions where the plasma is moving away from us. Here we see that while the QS plasma is falling down faster in the TR, the case is reversed in CHs! In-line with what we found from C II in #A1, Mg II k3 also tells us that the plasma is preferentially going away from us in CH at the chromosphere&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;! So this analysis tells us that the result we are seeing is something truly physical&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why could this be happening? Is there an “extra” push for the plasma to flow away from us in the CH, or is the plasma being stopped for some reason in the QS? And where are these flows coming from/going to? A clear dichotomy seems to occur between the chromosphere and TR – something is clearly happening at the interface of these two regions. And so to understand further, we study how the TR velocities change with chromospheric velocities. For instance, if a pixel shows upflow in Mg II k&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, what kind of flows does it show in Si IV? And how do these vary between CH and QS? This is a question we ask for multiple spectral lines, but I will just present the results for the Mg II k3 and Si IV below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/vishal4_plasma_moves/image3_plasma_moves_vishal.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Fig. 3: TR and chromospheric flow correlations in CHs (black) and QS (orange). Note that up-flows are blueshifts, and downflows are redshifts. 
Taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11668&quot;&gt;Vishal.U et al., 2022&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fig. 3a, we show downflows (=plasma moving away from us) in TR are related to downflows in the chromosphere. Turns out, the plasma that is moving away from us in TR is also seen moving away from us in the chromosphere, except that in QS the speed drastically reduces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we can look at how the upflows (=plasma moving towards us) in TR relate to the upflows in the chromosphere in Fig. 3b. Again, it turns out that the plasma that we see coming towards us in the chromosphere is getting accelerated towards us in TR. However, this time the CH plasma is accelerated more than QS! Next, we can also check if the plasma that is coming towards us the TR has any relation to the plasma that is moving away from us in the chromosphere. In Fig. 3c, interestingly, we find that faster the plasma in TR is coming towards us, faster is it also moving away from us in the chromosphere –with the upflows larger in CH. And finally, in Fig. 3d, it turns out that the plasma moving towards us in the chromosphere has not relation whatsoever with the plasma moving away from us in the TR. This is all very interesting, but what does it mean? 
It means that: (i). If a plasma parcel is moving towards us in the chromosphere, it would be accelerated even more in the TR. This seems like a signature of the solar wind coming towards us, but starting from the chromosphere – or maybe even lower! (ii). Plasma that is flowing down from the TR is decelerated as it falls down into the chromosphere, and this deceleration is much more in QS, and (iii). There seem to be flows coming out like “jets” both towards, and away from us – faster one end comes towards us, faster is the other end moving away from us! What is going on here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us handle each observation one by one, and then try to piece them together.First, why would plasma move? Plasma motion takes place if it is either forced to move due to pressure, or if the plasma is freely falling like a ball falls down once it’s thrown up. The freely falling case applies only to plasma that is falling down – for a plasma that is rising, we need something to pump pressure, like a piston. What could this mechanism be? A graphic summary is given in Fig. 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the solar atmosphere, it turns out there are complex mechanisms which can heat a small part of the plasma very quickly. Hot air rises, and similarly the plasma will be forced to rise. These complex mechanisms are generally “impulsive events”, for simplicity. These impulsive events are well known in the corona, and have been hypothesized to maintain the coronal temperature at a million degree Kelvin&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;! Hence, we may invoke a similar impulsive heat dumping mechanism throughout the solar atmosphere to get plasma moving!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the density in the solar atmosphere reduces drastically with height. If the amount of mass crossing a surface at a given time is kept constant, it can be shown that the velocity should increase with height (Fig. 4d). Thus, any upflows starting from the lower chromosphere due to these impulsive events will naturally accelerate, and can persist to great heights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, these impulsive events basically just dump some energy very quickly in the plasma. Since the plasma just needs to expand (and not only rise), the expansion can occur both ways – upwards and downwards! And if the energy were dumped between the chromosphere and TR, we will see plasma moving towards us in TR, and moving away from us in the chromosphere (Fig. 4a). These are called “bidirectional flows”. Thus, if more energy is dumped by the impulsive event, faster the plasma will move in both directions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let this event occur at a very great height – in the corona, for example. In such a case, we would only see the downward flowing plasma, since the upward flowing plasma would be seen in lines which form at much higher temperature. Hence this would be seen as persistent downflows (Fig. 4c)! However, note that the “freely-falling” plasma can also simply fall down,  and can give a similar signature (Fig. 4b).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/vishal4_plasma_moves/image4_plasma_moves_vishal.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

The blue arrows correspond to blueshifts (motion towards us), while red arrows show redshifts (motion away from us). The vertical colour is density – going from high density at bottom to low on top. Different scenarios are depicted across the figure.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how does this explain the difference between CH and QS? For this, we invoke something we kind of know from observations: How does the magnetic field approximately look like in CH and QS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fig. 5, open magnetic field lines (in black) are drawn near closed loops (in yellow) in CH, while closed loops alone are drawn in QS. When you have magnetic field lines close by, a phenomenon called magnetic reconnection can occur, which causes field lines to snap and rejoin. This will release a large amount of energy contained in the magnetic field in a very short period of time – these would be our impulsive events!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/vishal4_plasma_moves/image5_plasma_moves_vishal.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Fig. 5: A schematic depicting the proposed picture of impulsive heating occurring across different magnetic field topologies. In the left panel, we show a CH topology, including open funnel-like structure (black), closed loops of varying sizes (yellow), and impulsive events (red asterisks) due to interchange reconnection between the open and closed field lines, giving rise to bidirectional flows (blue and red arrows). The kinked field line propagating outward as a switchback is depicted as a dashed line, with the approximate propagation direction by black arrows. Right panel: QS topology shown with the same terminology as the left panel.
Image source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11668&quot;&gt;Vishal.U et al., 2022&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reconnection process itself just needs two magnetic field lines, preferably pointing in opposite directions. However, what happens to the plasma after reconnection depends on the overall shape of the field lines, which guide the motion of plasma. Hence, the resultant of reconnection will be different in CH and QS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the CHs we have “interchange reconnection” between the open field lines and closed loops. While this gives rise to the correlated motion, the plasma is preferentially guided away from the surface (and hence towards us as blueshifts) along the open field line. The open field eventually takes the plasma away, and puts it out into the solar wind. Since plasma is being taken away along the magnetic field, it doesn’t stay and emit enough light for us to see. However, depending on how predominant loops of different heights are, the signatures would be different. Hence, the solar wind may start from a range of heights, with something specific going on in the interface of chromosphere and TR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the QS, however, the reconnection is only between closed loops. In this case, while the correlated motion is present, the plasma is not allowed to escape into the solar wind, and is kept trapped inside the loop – this and the CH effect above give rise to the intensity ratio of Fig. 2a.! However, due to the presence of excess plasma at the bottom (remember, cool plasma can just gravitationally fall down towards the photosphere!) in QS, any downflows will be decelerated in QS. Thus, all our observations are naturally explained by invoking magnetic reconnection in what are called different magnetic topologies!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about the coronal heating problem? We have actually already described it – the reconnection mechanism! Energy dumping by reconnection is precisely the needed means to maintain the solar corona – however, this occurs across various heights in the atmosphere, but predominantly starting from the TR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one unexpected result from this scheme of things is the generation of what are known as switchbacks. In Fig. 5, the dashed field lines in the CH are how the magnetic field evolves after reconnection. Over the past couple of years, similar structures have been found in the solar wind, and called switchbacks. If the switchbacks form in the chromosphere/ TR, then the velocities that we provide will serve as constraints on the different models to test out the theory! Thus, in one neat sweep, we can potentially unify solar wind emergence, coronal heating, and switchback generation in a single mechanism!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this mean we have now solved all of these problems? No! On the contrary, we actually need to perform realistic (a subjective word!) simulations of the Sun to check the viability of various aspects of this model. For instance, we still need to understand some of the following questions: how much energy does a typical reconnection event release? How much of this energy is transformed to velocities of different ions? How much of this energy gets radiated away by the plasma? How many reconnection events typically occur in CHs and QS in the first place? Does all of the plasma eventually escape out into the solar wind? If so, do we find similar results while probing hotter (and cooler) spectral lines? These are some typical questions we are trying to answer in a future work!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SARAS 3 telescope refutes astrophysical origins of the claimed cosmic dawn signal</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SARAS 3 experiment&lt;/strong&gt;, designed and developed at &lt;strong&gt;Raman Research Institute&lt;/strong&gt;, has conclusively refuted the claim of detection of the signal from &lt;strong&gt;cosmic dawn&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;EDGES experiment&lt;/strong&gt;. It has become the &lt;strong&gt;first experiment worldwide to reach the required sensitivity and cross-verify the claim&lt;/strong&gt;. Given the unusual nature of the claimed signal, several non-standard cosmological models were proposed. &lt;strong&gt;SARAS 3 findings do not support these exotic models proposed previously. The results are now published in Nature Astronomy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first light in the Universe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observations of the cosmic microwave background have transformed our knowledge about the first atoms in the Universe. Similarly, we have a reasonable understanding of our local Universe through multi-wavelength observations conducted routinely via Earth and space-bound telescopes. However, there is a knowledge gap in understanding the transition of the Universe from being filled with hydrogen to the Universe as we know it today. The transition encompasses the very first stars and galaxies and ionization of the Universe through radiation emitted by them. This period, referred to as the cosmic dawn and epoch of reionization, poses several questions. These questions include the formation of the first stars in metal-free environments, heating and ionization of the Universe via radiation from these first stars, and timelines for various events in this period (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~loeb/sciam.pdf&quot;&gt;https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~loeb/sciam.pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the ways to answer these questions is to observe the cosmic dawn through radiation emitted by hydrogen atoms. Due to spin-flip transition, the hydrogen atom emits radiation at 21-cm wavelength (rest-frame frequency of 1420.4 MHz) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/web/Ch7.html#S8&quot;&gt;https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/web/Ch7.html#S8&lt;/a&gt;). The 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn is expected to arrive on Earth stretched in wavelength to meters and lowered in frequency by the expansion of the Universe to lie in the radio frequency band 50-200 MHz. Each frequency would provide a snapshot of the Universe at a given instant!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, detecting a signal from such an early period of the Universe is extremely difficult. The same frequency range is home to several terrestrial interference sources, including FM and TV stations, satellites, power line transmissions, etc. Even if one were to avoid all the terrestrial interference, our Galaxy emits radiation that is 100,000 times stronger than the strength of the signal! Another part of the challenge is that we do not know what the 21-cm signal looks like, unlike some other cosmological signals. While we have some broader ideas about its nature, its exact characteristics cannot be known owing to our poor understanding of the first stars. It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack while not knowing what the needle really looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such high precision measurements, the radio telescope must have high calibration accuracy to separate the contributions from the instrument, terrestrial interference, and the Galaxy to finally get down to the treasured 21-cm signal. Any small miscalibration of the telescope can lead to a false detection or limit us from reaching the sensitivity levels needed to detect the signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SARAS experiment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SARAS experiment at Raman Research Institute (RRI) is custom designed to detect the faint 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn. SARAS has been meticulously designed and calibrated to measure sky radiation to an accuracy of 0.0001%. Once built and tested, it is deployed in the remotest sites in India to observe the night skies in a minimum terrestrial interference environment. The observations span over a few weeks, followed by months of analysis, refinement of the design, and re-deployments for a fresh season of observations. Several surveys were conducted early on to find sites conducive to such experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDGES result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDGES is a radio telescope operating in Western Australia. It is led by astronomers at Arizona State University and MIT. The experiment claimed detection of the 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn in March 2018 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25792&quot;&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25792&lt;/a&gt;). This was the first discovery claim in the field of 21-cm cosmology and rightly created much excitement in the astronomy community worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the detection looked nothing like the theoretical predictions. The strength of the reported signal was at least twice compared to theoretical predictions. Therefore, the EDGES claim of detection led to several speculations about how the Universe might differ from current understanding. These speculations included exotic physics, non-standard cosmology, a new population of galaxies, and new models of dark matter that may have resulted in such an unusual signal. However, appreciating that in such difficult measurements, errors in instrument calibration might result in spurious deductions, cross verification of such a claim had become an urgent priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latest Deployment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third edition of the telescope, SARAS 3, was deployed on lakes with a focused goal to cross-verify the EDGES claim. This was the first instance ever for a radio telescope to observe on water. The reason for floating the telescope on the water is to provide a homogenous medium of high dielectric constant below the antenna. Such a medium enhances telescope performance and reduces confusing radio waves emitted by the very ground beneath radio telescopes. After an extensive search, two lakes in Karnataka, Dandiganahalli Lake and Sharavati backwaters, were selected for observations. The observations were carried out in January and March 2020, ending with a lockdown in Bangalore!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis and Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before one can start looking for the presence of the cosmological signature in the data, several corrections are required. These include calibrating the “bandpass response” of the telescope, rejecting the interference signals from terrestrial sources, accounting for the varying efficiency of the antenna over the observed frequency range, and subtracting off the contributions from the telescope and water. This process is followed by adopting a model that represents our knowledge about the emission from the Galaxy and any residual contributions left by the instrument. 
Once we have a model, we can ask whether the claimed cosmological signal exists in the processed data. By adopting several different methods of asking this question, SARAS 3 observations found no evidence of the signal via each of them. The signal was rejected at 95.3% confidence. Therefore, the finding implies that the detection reported by EDGES was plausible contamination from their instrument and not a signature from the early Universe. SARAS 3 was indeed the first experiment to reach the required sensitivity and cross-verify the claim of the signal detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, 21-cm signal from the early Universe continues to elude astronomers worldwide! Having rejected the EDGES claim, SARAS 3 team is planning more observations on remote lakes in India. At the same time, there is a strong motivation to find pristine sites with little to no interference. One of the best sites imaginable is the far side of the Moon! Effectively shielded from both the Sun and the Earth, it is one of the quietest sites in the solar system to conduct cosmological observations. Therefore, we are proposing a space-based payload, PRATUSH, that would orbit the Moon, conducting observations when in the far side 
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://wwws.rri.res.in/DISTORTION/pratush.html&quot;&gt;https://wwws.rri.res.in/DISTORTION/pratush.html&lt;/a&gt;). It is currently under study phase, supported by ISRO. Such expeditions will allow us to detect the 21-cm signal from the cosmic dawn and unravel this last remaining gap in the history of our Universe.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bending of Cosmic fountains, giving birth to a peculiar X-shaped galaxy</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When observed with a radio telescope, a giant peculiar X-shaped morphology is seen in some galaxies. It is difficult to understand what gives rise to such peculiar morphology; And, to date, this is a topic of debate among astronomers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that are billion times more massive than the sun reside at the centre of giant galaxies become active. During this active phase, the SMBH begins to rapidly accrete matter (hot ionized gas/plasma), some of which is violently thrown away along the SMBH’s spin axis by a complex process triggered by a strong magnetic disturbance. Hence, these active SMBHs usually throw jets of hot material out to large distances (out to a few billion light-years) with a velocity nearly the speed of light. These ejected jets resemble a structure that can very well be labelled as cosmic fountains. These jets typically consist of relativistic magnetised hot plasma (as the plasma is thrown, it also takes some of the magnetic field with it), which produce an outburst of radio emission via the synchrotron process. What’s surprising is that jet ejecta, which is expected to follow a particular path (a straight line; determined by the spin axis of the SMBH), sometimes bend from it and form a peculiar morphology that looks like the English letter ‘X’. So, when someone observes these galaxies with a radio telescope, they will find a giant X-like structure floating in the vast cosmos. It is difficult to understand what gives rise to such peculiar morphology; And, to date, this is a topic of debate among astronomers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/x-galaxy-gourabg-images/image1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!---
&lt;p align = &quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 1: Radio map (at 23 cm) of a galaxy named PKS 2014-55 obtained from MeerKAT telescope, showing a peculiar X-structure. Here one pair of lobes is called the active lobe and the other pair is called the wing. The extent of the formed structure is ~ 3 million light-years, traced by the straight black line. The elliptical curve here mimics the elliptical galaxy that hosts the structure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/495/1/1271/5831730&quot;&gt;Cotton et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent study led by our team of astrophysicists including Indian and Italian scientists, have addressed this issue by re-investigating the formation mechanism of such structures computationally. We identified a possible origin hidden within the host galaxy shape itself. This is quite similar to the Bengali saying, &lt;em&gt;The ghost is already hiding in plain sight&lt;/em&gt;. Using computer simulations performed using the Max Planck supercomputing cluster in Germany, we demonstrated the complex relationship between the X-morphology formation and the shape of the host elliptical galaxy, which plays a key role in deflecting the material hurled out by the supermassive black hole. To be specific, the already existing interstellar gas distribution of the galaxy itself is found responsible for deflecting the ejected hot plasma by the black hole sideways, giving the cosmic fountain (the ejected jet) an X-shape. In scientific terms, we demonstrated that as the jet propagates through the denser interstellar gas distribution of the galaxy, the jet head becomes unstable. As a result, it creates lots of back-flowing plasma material that traverse back again towards the centre of the galaxy. While doing so, the host galaxy specifies a path for its motion by providing a path with a maximum pressure gradient (the pressure gradient generates a force), which lies along the minor axis of the galaxy (i.e., along the shorter dimension of an ellipse). This generated force causes a deflection in the back-flowing plasma, creating the wing structure. Observational studies often find such alignments of these back-flowing materials along the minor axis of the host galaxy, which further supports our findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/x-galaxy-gourabg-images/image2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!---
&lt;p align = &quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 2: Here, we present our simulated X structure formed by the deflected, back-flowing plasma, generated from the jet head. The elliptical-shaped galaxy is visible in the top image. It is a 2D slice of our 3D simulation that is shown in the bottom image. The bottom image is a 3D velocity distribution plot seen from an angle to the y-axis. The blue and red colors here represent the velocity values that are +ve or -ve, representing forward or backward moving materials (to the y-axis).
&lt;/p&gt;
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our novel simulation has also shed light on a decade-old problem of these radio galaxies, which led our work towards a publication in a very prestigious European journal named Astronomy &amp;amp; Astrophysics by ESO (European Southern Observatory). The problem is noted below: Based on the properties of wing structure (which is less intense and rather diffuse than the active lobe), it was believed that the wing is a passively evolving feature (i.e., simply evolves under normal adiabatic expansion) compared to the active lobe, where the jet is currently in an active stage (by continuously filling itself with fresh and young plasma material from the SMBH). A similar characteristic has also been observed in our simulation showing the active lobe possessing freshly injected particles from the active galactic core, whereas the wing accumulates the older particles that back-flow from the jet head. Based on this, it can be stated that the active lobe should possess spectral index values flatter than the wing (flatter spectra mean younger particles; characteristics of synchrotron radiation). However, in observational studies, no systematic difference in the radio emission (hence in the spectral index) has been found in the four different arms of the X-shape. This further highlights that from a theoretical standpoint, there is a clear lag in the understanding of these galaxies’ emission processes, seriously contradicting the existing formation models. It has also led scientists to address these objects as peculiar sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work led by Gourab Giri and the team has offered a resolution to this issue with a critical analysis of these radio galaxies. They highlight that shock acceleration processes of ultra-fast electrons (travelling nearly at the speed of light!) cause such peculiar emission characteristics. A shock wave is a wave that is generated by a moving object when its speed of movement exceeds the speed of sound in that medium. In our work, we explicitly showed the origin of these shock waves in the four arms of X-shaped structure and hence their influence on the radio emission of such peculiar morphologies. The conclusion which came out from our work is that the shock acceleration significantly re-energizes the plasma by speeding them up (hence altering their spectra), keeping the particles alive which instead would have lost all their energy under several dominant cooling processes (radiative and adiabatic cooling). Most importantly, the wing, which was thought of as a passively growing structure of X-shaped galaxies, is actually very active as it produces shock acceleration sites in it. The shocks are generated due to the diverted back-flowing material, as also shown by the black arrow in Fig. 2, making the wing actively evolving. This can single-handedly explain the peculiar emission characteristics observed in X-shaped radio galaxies including the signature where no systematic difference in the emission of lobe and wing is found. Our work has already been appreciated by a greater scientific community. Additionally, the prestigious journal Astronomy &amp;amp; Astrophysics has also decided to feature our work on the cover page of their upcoming volume. This work is already available on the arXiv preprint server, handled by Cornell University, the USA for open-source science.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How much Metal does the Quiet Sun Corona contain?</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;XSM onboard Chandrayaan-2 observed the Sun during the deepest solar minimum of the past century from in 2019-2020. By studying the XSM spectra for the days when the Sun was very quiet, researchers have found that the abundances of all Mg, Al, Si is around two times higher than its abundances in the photosphere! They also calculated the temperature of the quiet Sun corona to be around 2 MK. This article explains how these measurements were made.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visible orange-yellow surface of the Sun that we can see even with the naked eye is called the Photosphere. It extends up to a height of 400 km. The temperature here decreases from 6000K, at the bottom of the layer, to 4500K at the top of the layer. This is expected because as we move away from a source of energy and heat, the temperature drops. The next layer is the Chromosphere, that is in between a height of about 400 - 2100 km. The temperature in the Chromosphere varies between about 4000 K at the bottom and 8000 K at the top. As the numbers show, in the Chromosphere, as we move upwards it gets hotter and not cooler as common sense suggests!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More mystifyingly, things get extremely hot (literally) as we move into the next layer, the transition region, which is just a 100 km in height but the temperature drastically increases from a few thousand kelvin to a few million kelvin! Temperature stays at a million degree kelvin in the Corona (which extends throughout the solar system) as well, which is the uppermost atmospheric layer of the Sun. The reason for this temperature increase in the solar atmosphere is one of the long standing problems of solar physics referred to as the &lt;em&gt;Coronal Heating Problem&lt;/em&gt;. You can read more about this in the article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmicvarta.in/vishal_machine_learning_corona_article&quot;&gt;Using machine learning to infer Solar Coronal heating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/lakshitha_quiet_corona_metal/image1_lakshitha2.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Corona is mainly visible in UV and X rays. This is because the hotter a material is, the light coming from it will be of higher energy. You can see this in daily life in the flames of a stove. The innermost regions of the fire will be bluish compared to the outer parts, which will be red, orange and yellow. As we have seen, since the Corona is at a million degree kelvin temperature, it emits mainly in the high energy part of the spectrum, that is, in UV and X-rays, while the Photosphere emits mainly in optical wavelengths that we can perceive with our naked eyes. This means that telescopes on the Earth are enough to observe and study the Photosphere. But since the ozone layer blocks UV and X rays (thankfully, otherwise we would not exist as we do now!), Coronal studies began only with advent of the space age and satellites in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another phenomenon that is related and similarly astonishing to the ‘Coronal Heating Problem’ that occurs in the transition region and the Corona is called as the First Ionization Potential (FIP) Effect. This effect deals with the abundances of elements in the Corona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after the launch of the first satellites with instruments to study the Sun in UV and X rays, &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1963ApJ...137..945P&quot;&gt;Stuart R. Pottasch&lt;/a&gt; in 1963 found something very weird concerning the elements present in the Corona. Using spectroscopy, that is, by studying light from the Corona, he discovered that the absolute abundances (i.e., the abundances with respect hydrogen) of certain elements &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization_energy&quot;&gt;the low FIP elements&lt;/a&gt; like magnesium (Mg), silicon (Si) and iron (Fe) were mode abundant (3-4 times higher!) in the Corona than in the Photosphere. Now you might ask why is this surprising? After all, Corona is a different layer with a very different temperature. So, why can’t it have different abundances of elements than the Photosphere, right? This is because all the material that is present in the Corona comes from the lower atmospheric layers through flares and Coronal mass ejections (CMEs). &lt;a href=&quot;https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/solar-activity/en/&quot;&gt;Flares&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/Coronal-mass-ejections&quot;&gt;CMEs&lt;/a&gt; are huge explosions that supply material and energy from the Photosphere to the Corona. So it was expected that the elemental abundances in the Corona will reflect that of the Photosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theories that are trying to explain the FIP effect predict that the FIP effect and the Coronal Heating Problem are intimately connected with each other. Thus studying one problem might give insights about the other and vice versa!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, many studies of the FIP effect have shown that the amount of FIP effect, which basically tells by how much the (low FIP) elements in the Corona are more compared to the Photosphere, is different in different structures of the Corona. Sun’s activity changes with an approximate period of 11 years called as the solar cycle. At the start of a cycle, large flares and CMEs on the sun are usually non-existent. With the progress of the cycle, activity increases, reaches a maximum and starts coming down again before the start of the next cycle. Studies have also shown that the elemental abundance in the Corona changes in accordance with the solar cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is relatively easier to study the Corona when explosions (flares and CMEs) happen. This is because the Sun is very active and outputs a large amount of UV and X rays which the instruments can receive. But studying the Sun when it is quiet requires extremely sensitive instruments to be present and observing the Sun. Here comes in Chandrayaan-2 live a saviour! The Chandrayaan-2 mission was launched in July 2019 and the orbiter carried an instrument called Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM), which is till date the most sensitive instrument to measure the sun’s spectra (light). For more information on XSM, refer to the article:&lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmicvarta.in/lakshitha_solar_article_corona&quot;&gt;Deciphering The Mysteries of The Quiet Sun Explosions&lt;/a&gt;. 2019 also marked the end of solar cycle 24 during which the sun was extremely quiet. This was the quietest the sun has been in the past 100 years! Thus with the Sun in its deep minimum and the XSM observing its inactivity, Santosh Vadawale and team have managed to decode the abundances of three (low FIP) elements - Mg, Al and Si  - in the quiescent Corona using spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spectroscopy is the study of light of different energies that is emitted by a source. The instrument that is used for spectroscopy is called as a spectroscope/spectrometer. And the output of a spectroscope is a spectrum (plural - spectra). A spectrum is basically a graph of intensity (or count rate which gives the number of photons) versus the wavelength (or energy) of light. It is possible to derive the temperature and other physical parameters by studying the shape of the spectrum (known as the continuum), and by studying the bumps (called as ‘emission lines or emission complexes’), it is possible to derive the abundances of various elements present in the source (see figure 2). Each emission line is a ‘signature’ of a different element. By modelling (i.e., comparing the strength of the observed line and shape of the continuum with that predicted by theory) the spectra, we can find the abundances and other physical parameters. For more in-depth information about spectroscopy, please refer to: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmicvarta.in/solar-chromosphere-spectral-lines-vishal&quot;&gt;Understanding the solar chromosphere through spectral lines.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By studying the XSM spectra for 73 days when the Sun was very quiet, they found that the abundances of all three elements (Mg, Al, Si) were around two times higher than the corresponding photospheric abundances. They also calculated the temperature of the quiet Sun to be around 2 MK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As no activity was happening on the Sun, XSM was even able to measure the absolute lowest X-ray energy emitted by the Sun, which is about 6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; Wm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. For comparison, the highest soft X-ray energy emitted by the Sun is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;   Wm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 6 orders of magnitude higher!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>EARTH-SIZED TELESCOPES FOR ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS IN THE LOW RADIO FREQUENCIES</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The study of the cosmos is only complete when we can receive and analyse data from the entire electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from picometer-sized gamma rays to several meters long radio waves. This realization is what led to the advent of multiwavelength astronomy. But even in today’s era when technology has paved the way for us to observe the sky in a very wide range of wavelengths, it still remains poorly explored at wavelengths greater than a few tens of meters. This is mainly because the Earth’s ionosphere blocks most of these wavelengths. Even if we could observe them, it would require us to build a telescope several kilometres wide to properly resolve the sources, which is physically impossible. This article is a review of a journal paper that tackles these issues by proposing to simulate an Earth-sized radio telescope. The paper dwells into some technical details on how we can achieve a radio telescope larger than the size of the Earth and discusses the advantages such a system would offer. This article tries to simplify the concepts involved, and introduce the readers to an exciting new domain in radio astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is for sure physically impossible to build a telescope larger than even a few hundreds of meters, you might be wondering how the paper suggests we build a telescope not just a few kilometres wide, but larger than the entire diameter of the Earth, which is just shy of 13,000km! To achieve such a feat, it is proposed we build several small observing elements and send them to space, to revolve around the Earth in different orbits. Then we employ some analysis techniques which can cumulatively be known as Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI, or more specifically, orbiting VLBI in our case, as our observing elements are all in orbit) to “stitch” the multiple images taken by each of these elements and produce a high-resolution image of the entire sky. Before we dive further into the how, what and why of the paper, let us first understand in some detail, these concepts involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radio astronomy is a subfield of astronomy that studies the universe in the radio spectrum (ranging from 1mm to 100km wavelengths). To fulfil this purpose, radio astronomy takes multidisciplinary contributions from physics, electronics and computer sciences alike. Radio waves are so large that we cannot practically use the typical lens and mirror arrangements that we use to observe in most other electromagnetic (EM) spectra. Lucky for us, the larger wavelengths mean smaller frequencies, small enough that we can “see” the crests and troughs of the wave using an antenna – yes, the same antenna that is in our smartphones and TV dishes! In fact, we can actually use our smartphones and TV dishes to observe the radio sky, albeit with a few modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/earth_size_telescope_jaini/image1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 1: The electromagnetic spectrum and the atmospheric opacity for different wavelengths. While the Earth’s atmosphere is almost completely transparent to short-wavelength radio waves, it is completely opaque to wavelengths longer than 15m. (Source: http://gisgeography.com/electromagnetic-radiation/)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few advantages of observing in the radio frequencies include the fact that most of the high frequency radio waves completely pass through the Earth’s atmosphere. So, we are able to perform ground-based observations, which are cheaper and less complicated. It is also possible to observe astronomical objects or phenomena that are nearly impossible to detect in other wavelengths. But where there are advantages, there are disadvantages as well. Radio waves having wavelengths greater than 15m are blocked completely by the ionosphere, as can be seen from Figure 1, rendering it impossible to make any observations of the radio sky at those wavelengths using ground-based telescopes. Radio waves also tend to be plagued by man-made radio frequency interference (RFI). These can be any signals generated by us, such as the FM and TV frequencies, mobile communication signals, signals from any and all electronic equipment we use, all of which corrupt the astronomical radio signals, making it difficult to study them from the ground.
Being able to see the sky at wavelengths greater than 15m is important, because it is expected to be extremely bright with never-before-seen astronomical phenomena. At the risk of using a few technical jargons, the sky at these frequencies will be dominated by non-thermal emissions, such as synchrotron emission, as well as free-free absorption from the thermal plasma that outer space has an abundance of. Interested readers can learn more about these phenomena by referring to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/web/Ch4.html&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, in order to grab this unprecedented opportunity to observe these new astronomical processes and to avoid the drawbacks of ground-based radio telescopes, we must go to space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vlbi-visibility-and-the-image-plane&quot;&gt;VLBI, Visibility and the Image Plane&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interferometry is a measurement technique that relies on the phenomenon of interference of light waves to produce a fringe (interference) pattern. Young’s double slit experiment and Michelson’s interferometer are two common experiments that most of you might have performed in your physics labs in your high school days.
VLBI is nothing but an extension of this technique for microwaves and radio waves. In VLBI, a signal from an astronomical source is collected using multiple radio telescopes (called as an array) placed some distance apart. Next, the distance between the radio telescopes is calculated using the difference between the time of arrival of the radio signals at different telescopes. This time difference is usually very small and is caused as the telescopes are located some finite distance apart. This allows observations of an object that are made simultaneously by many radio telescopes to be combined, thus creating a telescope with a size equal to the maximum separation between the telescopes, which is known as the maximum baseline. Since a radio telescope is nothing but an antenna, the signals received by each telescope are converted into voltages. These voltage signals are then amplified, filtered, digitized and then sent to the correlator, a digital device that cross-correlates the signals received from all the telescopes to produce the final image. In simple terms, the correlator “multiplies” each signal with every other signal and computes how well they are related.
VLBI is a very popular technique in radio astronomy because it enables the distance between telescopes to be much greater than that possible with conventional interferometry, which requires antennas to be physically connected by coaxial cables or other types of transmission lines. This, in turn, allows for the resultant images to be of much higher resolution. This can be inferred using the Rayleigh’s criterion, which specifies the minimum separation between two astronomical sources that may be resolved into distinct objects. This angular resolution (expressed in arcseconds) for any telescope is given by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\theta_{arcsec}&amp;space;\approx&amp;space;0.6&amp;space;\frac{&amp;space;\lambda_m&amp;space;/30m}{D_{km}/10000&amp;space;km}&amp;space;&quot; title=&quot;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\theta_{arcsec} \approx 0.6 \frac{ \lambda_m /30m}{D_{km}/10000 km} &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where, λm is the wavelength (in meters) and D_km is the size of the effective aperture of the telescope (in kms). In case of any interferometric technique, the size of the effective aperture will be equivalent to the maximum baseline of the radio telescope array. So, to sum it up, we can infer from Rayleigh’s criterion that the angular resolution is directly proportional to the wavelength and inversely to the effective aperture. Therefore, to obtain resolutions comparable to that in visible astronomy, radio astronomers must build telescopes a billion times the size, which is impractical. Instead, they employ VLBI, which gives them the option to use multiple smaller aperture telescopes to synthesize a larger aperture, at the expense of collecting area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ow that we understand the basics of VLBI, let us move on to the next important concept, which is visibility (also known as complex visibility or interferometric visibility by non-radio astronomers). In radio astronomy, visibility is defined as the response of the interferometer, which is the 2-dimensional Fourier transform of the sky brightness distribution. Fourier transform is a mathematical function that decomposes a time signal (which in our case, is the signal that a radio telescope receives) into the frequencies that make it up. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY&amp;amp;ab_channel=3Blue1Brown&quot;&gt;This video&lt;/a&gt; beautifully explains the concept of Fourier transform, and is a must watch for anyone interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sky brightness distribution is given by T(l,m), which is the intensity of radio waves coming from a particular location (l,m) in the sky, where l and m are angles and measured in radians. Finally, visibility is given by V(u,v), which is a complex function of signals correlated from all the radio telescopes in the array. This visibility is measured at a position (u,v) on any user-defined plane (called the image plane or the uv-plane) which usually is the ground for ground-based arrays. The u and v axes are measured in wavelengths (or km, in our case). The image plane can be considered as a simulated aperture of a telescope, and each telescope pair in the array would give two V(u,v) samples (for simplicity, we’ll hereon refer to it as just uv-sample) on the plane at a given time. So, an interferometer array with N telescopes will have N(N - 1)/2 baselines and give twice that number of samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/earth_size_telescope_jaini/image2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 2: The first picture shows three different configurations of the Submillimeter Array represented in blue, red and black colours. They are observing a source at a Dec of +22˚ at a frequency of 345 GHz. The second image shows the total uv-plane coverage when observing for 8 hours, as the telescopes move due to the Earth’s rotation, forming new baselines, and thus, new uv-samples. The black samples are due to the array configuration shown in black and so on. (Source: http://anita.edu.au/lectures)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the concept of image plane, imagine the screen on your phone or computer is the image plane. Now, let’s say every second a pair of telescopes in the interferometer array generates two samples, which correspond to two pixels on your screen. The more the telescopes you have in your array, the more samples are produced every second and the more pixels on your screen light up. Also, the longer you observe a source, the more unique baselines are formed, and again the more pixels on your screen light up. Ideally, we would want all the pixels on the screen to be lit up so that the source being observed is 100% imaged. But that is not possible because the telescopes in our array are separated from each other, and no matter how long you observe, there will always be dark spots on your screen, i.e., gaps on the image plane. What we can infer from this is that for better imaging, we would need better coverage of the uv-plane, which can be done by observing a specific source over a longer period of time. Refer to Figure 2 for a better visual explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a better grasp on the concepts of VLBI, visibility, the image plane and radio interferometry in general, interested readers can refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.radio2space.com/introduction-to-radio-interferometry/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; for a basic discussion and &lt;a href=&quot;http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/ast613/lectures/radio_iii/radio_iii.html&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; for a slightly more advanced coverage of the topics. If you aren’t much of a reader, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TwnZhiEc3A&amp;amp;ab_channel=AnitaChapter&quot;&gt;this 2-video series&lt;/a&gt; also does a fantastic job at simplifying these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system proposed by the paper extends all these concepts into space, with the radio telescopes now aboard satellites revolving around the Earth. Orbiting VLBI is not a new concept in radio astronomy and the proof of concept was shown as early as 1986, by the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) launched by NASA. Following that came the Space VLBI Satellite: MUSES-B under the Japanese VLBI Space Observatory Program (VSOP) and RadioAstron (Spektr-R) operated by the Russian Astro Space Center. An extensive study of the past, present and future of space VLBI can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01230&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all of these multi-element space-based radio interferometers have only been used in conjunction with ground-based telescopes, therefore, rendering them unusable for observations in the lower frequency window that we’re interested in. The increasing interest in the low frequency radio sky, though, has resulted in several fully space-based interferometric missions being proposed such as the Low-Cost Space-based Ultra-long wavelength Radio Observatory (SURO-LC) and Orbiting Low Frequency Antennas for Radio Astronomy (OLFAR), to name a few. These proposed swarms of small satellites would be orbiting close to the Earth or at other special locations within our solar system, such as the Lagrange L2 point or the lunar orbit and would have a large number of observing elements working together in aperture synthesis mode, but with baseline lengths limited to only about a 100 km or so.
The novelty of the model proposed by this paper lies in the fact that by performing sensitive imaging observations with very high angular resolutions at low frequencies, we can reveal astronomical objects and phenomena that have never been seen before. These are the prospects that led to the simulation of a suitable space interferometer system so as to enable such high-resolution imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-model&quot;&gt;The Model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model was simulated keeping in consideration to have a minimal number of observing elements to view the entire sky. Intuitively, we can see that having just two telescopes in space is not going to be sufficient, so the model begins by assuming three observing elements mounted on satellites in mutually orthogonal and near-circular Low Earth Orbits (LEO), which is an orbit ranging from 300km to 2000km above the Earth’s surface, as shown in Figure 3. Each of the observing elements is assumed to have a uniform field of view (FoV) of 2π steradians (in other words, the telescope can see the entire hemisphere in front of it). Such a configuration would allow us to have baselines of over 15000km, which is larger than the diameter of the Earth, thus enabling angular resolution as fine as 1 arcsec (from Rayleigh’s criterion) even at 4 MHz (or wavelength of 75m).
The three satellites have different orbital heights, making their orbital periods distinct from each other. These orbital heights are deliberately chosen such that the orbits are mutually asynchronous. This ensures that the apparent baselines are distinctly different during each orbital cycle, thus giving a significantly better coverage of the uv-plane in a relatively short time span. The orbital speeds and time periods of the satellites can be calculated from the Newton’s law of gravitation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Orbital~velocity,&amp;space;~s=\sqrt{\frac{GM_e}{R&amp;plus;h}}&amp;space;&quot; title=&quot;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Orbital~velocity, ~s=\sqrt{\frac{GM_e}{R+h}} &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Time&amp;space;~Period,&amp;space;~T&amp;space;\approx&amp;space;\frac{2\pi&amp;space;(R&amp;plus;h)}{s}&amp;space;&quot; title=&quot;https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Time ~Period, ~T \approx \frac{2\pi (R+h)}{s} &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where, G (= 6.67&lt;em&gt;10-11 Nm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/kg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is the universal gravitational constant, Me (= 5.982&lt;/em&gt;1024 kg), R (= 6371km) is the radius of Earth, and h is the orbital height of the satellite above the Earth’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 3: An illustration of the model configuration: The near circular orbits (not to scale, and appearing in projection as ellipses) for the three satellites are shown. The first satellite has an equatorial orbit (red), and the other two (Satellites 2 and 3) have polar orbits (blue and green, respectively). The black circle in the centre denotes the Earth. (Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03113&quot;&gt; Figure 2 of the paper.&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various parameter values defined for each satellite are given in Table 1. These values were obtained by extensively testing the sensitivity of the uv-plane coverage to these parameters. The orbital height of satellite 1 is chosen to be greater than 700 km so as to be able to avoid the effects of atmospheric drag which are substantial at heights below 400 km as well as to avoid attenuation of the radio waves due to the ionospheric plasma which is significant at orbital heights below 700 km.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;td&gt;Satellite 3&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;1400 km&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;7.17 km/s&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;113.53 min&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;


&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the model is different from the usual Earth-based and Earth-and-space-based interferometer systems, the typical definition of the uv-plane as the ground plane would not suffice. So, the uv-plane was explicitly defined in a different manner, with its origin at the centre of the Earth and the plane perpendicular to the direction of the source being observed. After extensive testing, an observing period of 16 days was found to be optimal. In order to obtain the maximum and minimum possible uv-plane coverages during this observation period as well as to find out the extent of the coverages, three exclusive source directions are chosen representing the extreme cases (as shown in Figure 3). These directions, namely A, B, and C, are defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Direction A: RA = 03:00:00 Dec = +45 deg, inclined equally to all three satellite orbit axes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Direction B: RA = 03:00:00 Dec = 0.0 deg, representing a set of specific directions that are perpendicular to one of the satellite orbit axes (or in the plane of that orbit) and inclined equally with the other two.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Direction C: RA = 00:00:00 Dec = 0.0 deg, perpendicular to any two of the satellite orbit axes and parallel to the third axis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be easily visualized that any source in the sky would fall within the bounds of these three directions relative to them. The corresponding uv-plane coverages are shown in Figure 4 and the evolution of the coverages over these 16 days can be viewed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/SpaceInterferometer&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/earth_size_telescope_jaini/image4.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

Figure 4: The uv-coverages over the duration of 16 days, for the three source directions A, B and C from left to right. The red, blue, and green tracks represent the baseline corresponding to the satellite pairs 1–2, 2–3, and 3–1, respectively. The u and v axes are indicated in km. (Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03113&quot;&gt; Figure 3 of the paper. &lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring this coverage quantitatively, it is found that the percentage coverage lies between a maximum of 64% and a minimum of 55.5% for any source for an observation period of 16 days, which is significantly greater than what we usually obtain with ground-based interferometer setups (which is typically around 15% for the same observing duration). So, the model not only has much greater baselines, but is also capable of giving significantly better coverage for any source, which would ultimately result in very fine angular resolutions and better imaging capabilities at low radio frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper then proceeds to discuss the sensitivity of this coverage to the satellite orbits so as to be able to determine the best relative positions of the satellites with respect to each other. Next, it discusses the quality of the final image based on the simulations. Finally, it compares our minimal 3-satellite model with another 4-satellite model, to examine how much of an advantage adding a fourth satellite would be, how that would be reflected in terms of the improvement in uv-coverage and the time taken to obtain the desired coverage. The results indicate that even with a system of four satellites (and six baselines) the total percentage coverage is essentially similar to that obtained with three satellites when observed for the same time duration of 16 days. Although it is noted that when observed for shorter durations, the percentage coverage by the 4-satellite system is noticeably more than that of the 3-satellite one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we discuss the importance of a fully space-based interferometer to observe the low frequency sky with very high angular resolutions and uv-plane coverages and that a minimal configuration with just three elements is optimum for the purpose scientifically, technologically and economically. Easier said than done though, because going to space entails its own challenges. While an elaborate study of them is beyond the scope of this paper, it does acknowledge some of the major ones and discusses possible solutions, showing that there are ways to not only overcome these challenges, but also use them to our advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Identifying emission-line stars from a large spectroscopic database</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We present a catalog of 3339 hot emission-line stars (ELS) identified from 451,695 O, B, and A type spectra, provided by the LAMOST DR5 release. We developed an automated python routine that identified 5437 spectra having a peak between 6561 and 6568~Å. False detections and bad spectra were removed, leaving 4138 good emission-line spectra of 3339 unique ELS. We re-estimated the spectral type of 3307 spectra as the LAMOST Stellar Parameter Pipeline (LASP) did not provide accurate spectral types for these emission-line spectra. As Herbig Ae/Be stars show higher excess in near-infrared and mid-infrared wavelengths than Classical Ae/Be stars, we used 2MASS and WISE photometry to distinguish them. Finally, we report 1089 Classical Be, 233 Classical Ae, and 56 Herbig Ae/Be stars identified from the LAMOST DR5. In addition, 928 B[em]/A[em] stars and 240 CAe/CBe potential candidates are identified. From our sample of 3339 hot emission-line stars, 2716 ELS identified in this work do not have any record in the SIMBAD database and they can be considered as new detections. Identification of such a large homogeneous set of emission-line spectra will help the community to study the emission phenomenon in detail without worrying about the inherent biases when compiling from various sources.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand what emission line stars (ELS) are, one needs to know about the spectrum of a star. Each star has its own unique spectrum, analogous to the fingerprint of humans. A spectrum can be used to identify the properties of the star such as its temperature, chemical composition and (indirect) physical constraints. So clearly, spectroscopy of cosmic objects can reveal lots of information about the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let us ask a more basic question. What is a spectrum? To understand this, imagine a rainbow on a rainy day. A rainbow is formed when the sunlight passes through the water molecules suspended in the air after the rain. As the sunlight moves through a spherical water droplet, it gets dispersed into various colours ranging from Violet to Red. This is a real-life example of spectroscopy. The light from a stellar object, when passed through a slit or a prism (the optical equivalent of the spherical water droplet), gets split into various colours. If the light from the star is as ideal as white light is, which is made up of all the colors with equal intensity, we would get a beautiful color gradient with all colors shining equally. However, the universe is not that simple. The spectrum of a star will have bright and dark lines, similar to the way we have ridges and valleys in our fingerprint (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/sridharan1_emission_stars_database/image1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Figure 1:  A representative high-resolution spectrum showing the visible light of alpha Boo. The black lines in this spectrum are caused due to various metallic elements present in the photosphere of the cool giant alpha Boo.
Image source:&lt;a hrefsridharan1_emission_stars_database=&quot;https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noao-arct/&quot;&gt;N.A.Sharp, NOIRLab/NSF/AURA)
 &lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These bright and dark lines (or emission and absorption lines) are the most crucial information of the spectrum. They tell us about the atomic and molecular processes going on in the top most layer of the star which is known as the photosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An absorption line is formed in the spectrum when light of a certain wavelength is absorbed by an atom or a molecule. Similarly, an emission line is formed when light of a certain wavelength is emitted (or radiated) by an atom or a molecule. To put it simply, when an atom ‘absorbs’ light, it goes into a higher energy level and when it ‘emits’ light, it comes down to a lower energy level as shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/sridharan1_emission_stars_database/image2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Figure 2: The above plots show the absorption and emission process as caused by the excitation and de-excitation of electrons around the nucleus.
Image source:&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webassign.net/labsgraceperiod/ucscgencheml1/lab_6/manual.html&quot;&gt;webassign &lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spectrum of a star is the information that gives us the intensity at each wavelength of light. An observed stellar spectrum consists of the blackbody continuum, absorption lines and in some cases, emission lines. The blackbody continuum in the visible and infrared region is due to the thermal emission of the star and the absorption lines are seen because the ‘cooler’ photosphere absorbs light at certain wavelengths. These two components are seen in the spectrum of all the stars because it arises due to the basic structure of stars. Now let us come to the topic of this article, ELS. Emission lines arise from a hot, gaseous region around the star that is formed due to some special nature of the star. The type of stars that show emission lines in their spectrum are called Emission line stars (ELS). You can call them the rebellious group of star families, who want to be unique by showing emission lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various types of ELS known to us today (and its analogues)
Pre-main sequence (PMS) stars - young, naughty teenagers creating chaos
Classical Be stars - people with midlife crisis
Wolf-Rayet stars - old, wise people
Even though ELS comprises stars in various evolutionary phases, in most cases the emission arises from the equatorial circumstellar disc which is made of gas and dust. The formation mechanism of circumstellar disc varies between different classes. For example, in PMS stars the circumstellar disc is the accretion disc through which material is added to the star from its surroundings. In Classical Be stars, the disc is formed due to rapid spinning of the star which pushes away material from the star to its surroundings. So it should be noted that even though we put stars with emission lines into a single category of ELS, they are very different from each other. Hence, we need to classify them based on their photometric properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aim&quot;&gt;Aim:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As large-scale spectroscopic surveys collect a large number of spectra every night, we need to identify special classes of stars such as ELS and classify them into different categories for the research community to study various emission mechanisms. This is the motivation for the work titled “Discovery of 2716 hot emission-line stars from LAMOST DR5’’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data&quot;&gt;Data:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) is a multi-object telescope that can observe around 4000 stars in one night. By its 5th data release (DR5), it had accumulated around 9 million spectra from 2011-2017 which are available to the community. We made use of this huge database to increase the number of ELS stars known to us. One interesting fact about LAMOST is that the majority of  observed stars are in the Galactic anticenter direction. This is particularly important because the earlier studies which have identified ELS have not looked into this direction of the sky. So this opened up an opportunity to study ELS in previously less explored parts of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we took O, B and A type stars (Teff ranging from 30000 K to 10000 K) from the LAMOST DR5 database (for an explanation of different spectral types, look into Anusha R’s CAe article). We restricted ourselves to these spectral types because the main aim of this was to identify new Classical Be/Ae and Herbig Be/Ae stars. Once we removed bad quality (Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) &amp;lt; 10)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; spectra from our list, we used an open-source python package called ‘scipy.signal’ to identify emission peaks. The entire definition of ELS rests on the presence of one of the most commonly found emission line, Hα at 6563 Å. We searched and picked out spectra with the Hα line anywhere between 6561 Å and 6568 Å. This range was selected to take into effect the instrumental calibration defect (if any) and the doppler shift that may be seen in a few stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identified 4138 spectra that belong to 3339 unique ELS stars from our analysis. To classify stars into different categories such as CBeAe or HBeAe, we need an accurate spectral type for each spectrum. The LAMOST automated pipeline does provide a spectral type for each spectrum which did not turn out to be accurate due to the presence of emission lines. This introduced the necessity for us to re-estimate spectral type for each spectrum. We followed a technique called template matching. We made use of the MILES stellar spectral library for this purpose. For each spectrum, we matched the templates from MILES library to our target spectrum and identified the best fit. Then the spectral type of the best fit template was assigned to the target spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to differentiate between Classical Be/Ae and Herbig Be/Ae stars, we made use of the inherent difference between them known as Infrared (IR) excess. Herbig Be/Ae stars, being young stars, have lots of gas and dust around them in addition to a circumstellar disc. This extra gas and dust reprocesses the energy from the star and emits them in infrared wavelengths. Due to this, the HAeBe stars are brighter in IR wavelengths than CBe stars. Hence we use the photometric data&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; available to us to differentiate them based on colors and spectral indices. The breakup of various classes identified in this work is given in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visually examined the Hα line features belonging to each class and reported their statistics. Finally, a representative spectrum of major classes is presented in Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-scope&quot;&gt;Future Scope:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research work identifies new ELS stars from a large database and classifies them into various categories based on their photometric properties. As the data collection capabilities increase day-to-day, the need for such works increases. We have multiple follow-up works in the fray which uses the LAMOST database effectively in identifying and study the properties of CBeAe and HAeBe stars in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bengaluru: The Astronomy City</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As part of the National Science day celebrations, the Indian Institute of Astrophysics organised a panel discussion titled- Bengaluru The Astronomy City. The focus of the meeting was to educate the young students regarding various opportunities in astronomy and astrophysics at all educational levels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total of 10 institutions located in Bengaluru took part in the event namely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iiap.res.in/&quot;&gt;Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icts.res.in/&quot;&gt;International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rri.res.in/&quot;&gt;Raman Research Institute (RRI)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isro.gov.in/&quot;&gt;Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iisc.ac.in/&quot;&gt;Indian Institute of Science (IISc)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://christuniversity.in/&quot;&gt;CHRIST (Deemed to by University)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sjc.ac.in/&quot;&gt;St. Joseph’s College&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bas.org.in/&quot;&gt;Bangalore Astronomical Society (BAS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://abaaonline.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Association of Bangalore Amateur Astronomers (ABAA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.taralaya.org/&quot;&gt;JawaharLal Nehru Planetarium (JNP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These institutes include core research institutes (1-4), Universities (5-7), amateur organizations (8-9) and a planetarium (10) involved in astronomy research and outreach. The panel consisted of a diverse group of individuals which included Ph.D. students, postdoctoral fellows, senior faculty members as well as amateur astronomers.
The representatives introduced themselves, about their career paths and how they reached their current positions. Niruj Mohan Ramanujam from IIA started the event with an introduction to the panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the introductions were over, Sonali Sachdeva from RRI gave a presentation covering opportunities for students as well as interested minds at almost all educational levels. The initial slides focussed on the opportunities in astronomy for school students. For instance, the following opportunities were presented for school students:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Public talks especially for school students which are regularly organized by all participant organisations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Schools can invite a scientist to interact with the students (ICTS)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Science workshops for students and teachers (JNP)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Science Education in Early Development (SEED) Summer Program for students (JNP)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Science Over Weekends (SOW) for high school students (JNP)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maths Circle (ICTS)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outreach programs for govt schools in North Bengaluru (ICTS)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Young Scientist Program (ISRO)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the opportunities available to school students, the subsequent slides presented opportunities for students at the college level. The opportunities at the BSc and MSc levels were presented in detail. All the participating institutes provided information regarding short or long term research projects under the guidance of their faculty members. The complete information is available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB13TdvmkRU&quot;&gt;the video.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next part of the discussion focused on the opportunities for prospective Ph.D. students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bengaluru probably has the highest number of astronomy Ph.D. students in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the participant research institutes and universities offer Ph.D. programs for students from both science and engineering backgrounds. Students are admitted through national eligibility tests such as GATE/JEST/NET and/or through their own entrance exams, followed by an interview. These researchers can also carry out their research in collaboration with multiple universities/institutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information about the opportunities for amateur astronomers was provided by representatives from ABAA and BAS, organizations which have been educating Bengalurians about astronomy and astronomical events for a long time. JNP offers a variety of programs and workshops for people from all backgrounds and expertise. These programs have been attracting thousands of students every year for more than three decades. So far, over 135 students who have benefitted from these programs have taken up astronomy research as their career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation was followed by a discussion session which was quite lively and people asked a wide variety of questions such as the opportunities for primary school children, visits of students to the research laboratories, teacher training opportunities, and support for astronomy clubs in schools. For a lot of questions, the panelists provided their perspectives which provided comprehensive answers to these questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, information regarding new opportunities was provided by the institutions such as ISRO which has launched the ‘Young Scientist Program’. Representatives from IIA provided detailed information about Engineering or astronomy-based projects for the upcoming 30m telescope. Students were provided detailed information about how to apply for research projects at these research institutes. Information about summer programs and internships for MSc/engineering students in all the institutes were also discussed. The links provided at the end of the article provide comprehensive information about these opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the vibrant discussion, it is evident that Bengalurians are a curious lot when it comes to research happening in Astronomy. It was noticeably observed that parents are particularly interested in exposing their kids to astronomy and science in general from a very young age. The panelists were also excited to share more of their work. This discussion indeed seems like the first step towards the combined efforts of all these institutions coming together to take astronomy to the Bengaluru people. We hope for many more such efforts to follow in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Understanding the evolution of the binary star system ‘Cen X-3’: New measurements of the spin and orbital parameters of the system </title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Researchers from Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, present the new measurements of the spin and orbital parameters of the binary star system ‘Cen X-3’. This work is a step forward in understanding the complex dynamics of the binary star systems and their evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Cen X-3’&lt;/strong&gt; is a binary star system observed in the constellation &lt;em&gt;‘Centaurus’&lt;/em&gt;. It is one of the most luminous X-ray sources in our galaxy and the first-ever X-ray pulsar to be discovered.
Scientists from the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune present the &lt;strong&gt;new measurements of spin and orbital parameters of ‘Cen X-3’&lt;/strong&gt;. The results are crucial in &lt;strong&gt;understanding the life-cycle and evolution of X-ray binary systems&lt;/strong&gt;. The work is published in the &lt;em&gt;‘Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy on AstroSat: Five Years in Orbit’&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers used the data from the &lt;strong&gt;Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters (LAXPCs)&lt;/strong&gt; onboard &lt;strong&gt;Astrosat&lt;/strong&gt;, for the analysis. &lt;strong&gt;Astrosat&lt;/strong&gt; is India’s first dedicated multi-wavelength space telescope launched by the &lt;em&gt;Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)&lt;/em&gt; in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cen X-3&lt;/strong&gt; is a two-star system consisting of a &lt;strong&gt;pulsar&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;highly magnetized neutron star beaming X-rays&lt;/em&gt;, and a companion star. The neutron star is an extremely compact object; &lt;em&gt;as massive as our sun but only a few kilometers across in size!&lt;/em&gt; The neutron star in Cen X-3 gravitationally accretes matter from its companion star. The kinetic energy of the infalling matter is converted to other forms of energy including electromagnetic radiation. The neutron star’s magnetic field dictates the accretion flow inside the magnetosphere. The accreting matter is channeled along the magnetic field lines and onto the magnetic poles forming an accretion column. The neutron star’s rotational axis is not necessarily aligned with its magnetic axis. Such &lt;em&gt;misalignment&lt;/em&gt; gives rise to &lt;em&gt;highly periodic pulsations&lt;/em&gt; hence the name &lt;strong&gt;‘pulsars’&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/Understanding-the-evolution-of-the-binary-star-system-Cen-X-3-ketan-images/image1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Figure 1: Illustration of an accretion-powered pulsar. The magnetic axis sweeps earth in every rotation of the neutron star due to misalignment between the rotational axis and the magnetic axis giving rise to highly periodic pulsations.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both stars are gravitationally bound and revolve around each other. The binary orbit can evolve due to matter exchange between the stars, mass loss from the binary system, and due to tidal interaction between the two stars. Studying the evolution of the orbit of such systems is important in understanding stellar structure and evolution. The results of these studies can be a &lt;strong&gt;direct test for stellar structure models and evolution theories&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;first step in doing such a study is to determine the binary orbit&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In systems like Cen X-3, the companion star is almost 10-15 times heavier than the neutron star. Thus the center of mass of the binary system is much closer to the center of the companion star than the neutron star. In such cases, one can visualize the binary orbit, as illustrated in figure 2 where the neutron star is orbiting around the companion star.  Due to its motion in the binary orbit, the neutron star moves back and forth along the line of sight. The observed frequency of the pulses from the neutron star is shifted due to this motion owing to the phenomenon called the &lt;strong&gt;‘Doppler effect’&lt;/strong&gt;. Due to this effect, &lt;em&gt;when the neutron star is moving towards the observer, the pulses arrive faster and when the neutron star is moving away from the observer, the pulses are delayed&lt;/em&gt; as shown in figure 2.
This results in a periodic variation with time in the observed pulse frequency. The rate of this variation corresponds to the orbital period of the system. For a perfectly circular orbit, the pulse frequency variation is sinusoidal. The deviation from the sinusoidal behavior is indicative of the eccentricity in the orbit. Eccentricity is a measure of how elongated the orbit is. The eccentricity of a perfectly circular orbit is zero. The higher the eccentricity, the more elongated the orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The binary orbit can be &lt;strong&gt;determined completely&lt;/strong&gt; from this. For a system with a nearly circular orbit like Cen X-3, &lt;strong&gt;parameters that can describe the system dynamics&lt;/strong&gt; completely are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neutron star spin period and its rate of change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Period of the binary orbit and its rate of change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Orbital velocity and radius&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eccentricity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the orbit can be understood by comparing the orbital parameters at various instances of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parisee Shirke (IUCAA, Pune) and the team&lt;/strong&gt; found that the &lt;strong&gt;spin period&lt;/strong&gt; of the neutron star has reduced to &lt;strong&gt;4.80s&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;4.81s&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that the neutron star is &lt;strong&gt;spinning up&lt;/strong&gt; which is as per its known behavior. However, the rate at which the neutron star is spinning up has halved. This can be due to &lt;strong&gt;variation in the rate of matter accretion from the companion star&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;orbital period&lt;/strong&gt; was found to be around &lt;strong&gt;2.03 days&lt;/strong&gt;. The rate of change of the orbital period was observed to be &lt;strong&gt;substantially large compared to the previously reported values&lt;/strong&gt;. The authors state that this &lt;strong&gt;could be due to short time-scale variations&lt;/strong&gt; in the orbital period. The &lt;strong&gt;orbital velocity&lt;/strong&gt; is measured to be around &lt;strong&gt;410 Km/s&lt;/strong&gt; which agrees with the previous measurements. The &lt;strong&gt;projected radius&lt;/strong&gt; of the orbit has decreased from &lt;strong&gt;39.66 lt-s&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;38.23 lt-s&lt;/strong&gt;. This change is &lt;strong&gt;in accordance with the observed orbital decay&lt;/strong&gt; in Cen X-3. The binary orbit is observed to be &lt;strong&gt;nearly circular&lt;/strong&gt; with a very small eccentricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work is a step forward in understanding the &lt;strong&gt;complex dynamics of the binary star systems and their evolution&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sir C. V. Raman: Raman effect and beyond</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We Indians celebrate &lt;strong&gt;National Science Day&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;28th February&lt;/strong&gt; each year to mark the &lt;strong&gt;discovery of the Raman effect&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Sir C. V. Raman&lt;/strong&gt;. Some of Raman’s discoveries like the &lt;strong&gt;Raman effect (for which he was awarded the Nobel prize), Raman-Nath theory, his studies on Brillouin scattering, the soft mode process&lt;/strong&gt;, etc. are so well known and outstanding, that they tend to overshadow many of his other elegant and significant contributions to the science. We attempt to highlight a few of Raman’s discoveries such that they &lt;strong&gt;portray a more complete picture of Sir C. V. Raman and his contributions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sir C. V. Raman&lt;/strong&gt; occupies a very special place in the &lt;strong&gt;scientific landscape of India&lt;/strong&gt;. His contributions to science were monumental both in &lt;strong&gt;scale and scope&lt;/strong&gt;. He also played a pivotal role in &lt;strong&gt;shaping Indian science institutions and redefined the way in which science was done in India&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Max Born&lt;/strong&gt;, a nobel prize winning german scientist who was instrumental in the development of the quantum mechanics, had this to say about Raman,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;
“There is no Indian physicist of the rank of Raman. No man can compare with him in vigor or intensity.”
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-curious-case-of-a-relentless-experimentalist&quot;&gt;The curious case of a relentless experimentalist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the year 1921. You could find a turbaned Indian man on a ship returning from Europe to India, running all around, with his nicol prisms and cardboard tubes, collecting sea water from the depths of the ocean. The visual beauty of the Mediterranean ocean had bewitched him.
Not so long ago, Lord Rayleigh had shown that the blue color of the sky is due to scattering of light by air molecules. However, according to Lord Rayleigh, the blue color of the deep ocean was due to reflection of the sky in the water.
Raman showed, by a simple experiment he performed on board the ship, that the blue color of the ocean is due to molecular scattering and not just due to the reflection of the sky. He quenched the sky’s reflection with a nicol prism at the Brewster angle and found that the blue color &lt;i&gt;“far from being impoverished by suppression of the sky reflection was wonderfully improved thereby”&lt;/i&gt;.
In 1922, he wrote the celebrated monograph &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/110505a0&quot;&gt;“Molecular Diffraction of Light”&lt;/a&gt; and so began the saga of a single-minded man pursuing his vision with a stamina and persistence never seen before, which eventually lead to the discovery of the Raman effect and many other outstanding contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weak-fluorescence&quot;&gt;Weak Fluorescence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 1923, KR Ramanathan, one of Raman’s students, studied the scattering of light in water. Sunlight was focussed on the liquid and the scattered light was observed through a system of complementary filters, each filter completely cutting off the light transmitted by the other. Nothing should have been observed if there had been no change of color during the scattering process. However, a track of scattered light could be observed showing there was indeed a change in the color of light during scattering. This was attributed to a “weak fluorescence” due to impurities which were believed to be present. Raman was not convinced with this explanation though.
This “weak fluorescence” was not completely depolarised (as true fluorescence should have been) and the amount of depolarisation changed with wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-raman-effect&quot;&gt;THE RAMAN EFFECT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Newspaper announcements of the discovery of the Raman effect
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 1927, the so-called polarised “weak fluorescence” was observed again by S Venkateswaran in pure glycerine with greater intensity. Due to limited availability of S Venkateswaran, Raman persuaded KS Krishnan, one of his brightest students, to set up experiments to find “weak fluorescence” in various materials. Raman and Krishnan worked together continuously and detected the polarized “weak fluorescence” in all the liquids, gasses and solids they examined.
According to Krishan, Raman personally verified all the liquids exhibited this phenomenon. Raman was so excited about the discovery that he rushed to Krishan’s home at night to inform him that their observations were related to the Kramers-Heisenberg process they were looking for all these years.
A note was sent to &lt;strong&gt;the Nature journal&lt;/strong&gt; about the discovery. However, Raman continued his experiments, mostly by himself since the observed phenomenon was not yet fully understood.
On &lt;strong&gt;February 28th 1928&lt;/strong&gt;, Raman examined the scattered light with a direct vision spectroscope and found that the classical and modified scattering appear in the spectrum as separate regions with a distinct dark region between them, a clear demonstration of a change of wavelength in scattering.
The &lt;strong&gt;Nobel Prize in Physics 1930&lt;/strong&gt; was awarded to Raman &lt;strong&gt;“for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the effect named after him.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;indian-musical-instruments-and-acoustics&quot;&gt;Indian musical instruments and acoustics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before Raman started working on the scattering of Light, he was fascinated by waves… sound waves! Raman’s father, R Chandrasekhara Iyer was a teacher of Physics and Mathematics and a proficient violinist. That must have influenced him to take interest in the physics of sound waves. Raman himself played violin. At the age of 16, when he was a student of the Presidency college, Madras, Raman commenced his acoustic research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Illustration of a Veena
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He investigated whether his intuition that the veena produces the most exquisite musical sound is due to sentiment or has a sound physical basis. The bridge of the veena is so cunningly constructed that the Helmholtz law, which states that the position at which the string is plucked cannot be a node, is violated. Thus this instrument produces innumerable harmonics making its sound closest in harmonic content to the human voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/science_day_raman_ketan_images/tabla.PNG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;The mridangam and tabla produce a succession of musically harmonic overtones in the same way as any stringed instrument
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sharp ear with a keen interest in music can detect musical overtones in the sound of the mridangam and the tabla. Raman discovered that the heterogeneous loading of their membranes can produce harmonics - so that in the hands of the masters, the Indian drum is similar to a stringed instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;diffraction-of-light-by-ultrasonic-waves---raman-nath-theory&quot;&gt;Diffraction of light by ultrasonic waves - Raman-Nath Theory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Young’s double slit experiment conclusively showed that the interference pattern can be obtained from interaction of light with matter. How about the interaction of light with matter waves!
Raman-Nath theory explained a remarkable optical phenomenon that occurs when a parallel beam of light is diffracted by ultrasonic waves. In modern electro-optic instrumentation, the phenomenon of diffraction of light by ultrasonic waves is utilized in acousto-optic spectrometers, which analyze the electrical signal to obtain its power spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;colors-in-nature&quot;&gt;Colors in Nature&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raman always had a huge fascination for colors. In the institute that he had built for himself after retirement (now Raman Research Institute), he started building his collection of colorful minerals gathered from all across the world. The collection includes limestones, marbles, alabaster, gypsums, tourmalines, agates, quartzites, jades, amethysts, fluorites, micas, serpentines, iolites, malachites, lapis lazuli and feldspars. Raman studied several of the exquisite optical phenomena displayed by these minerals. Due to lack of basic facilities during the initial days of his new institute, he had to mostly rely on the beam of sunlight to explore the optics of these substances. Even with such simple setups, it is remarkable that he could extract a substantial amount of information about these minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Raman’s collection of minerals
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birds are a delight to watch! Raman was very curious about the optical characteristic and the color distribution in birds, since it was so different in different parts of the same bird, in different specimens and in different species that no single explanation would suffice. He would invoke every known optics concept to try to explain these phenomena. He published only one paper on this topic; however talked about it a lot. The interest was not just limited to birds though. “Birds, Beetles and Butterflies” was his favorite title for the talk. He gave dozens of lectures on this subject, each one unique!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;diamond&quot;&gt;Diamond&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after the discovery of the Raman effect, C Ramaswamy, Raman’s younger brother, asked him to suggest a research problem which he could pursue. Seeing the diamond ring of the newly wed Ramaswamy sported on his finger, Raman suggested the study of scattering in diamond. The famous 1332 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; Raman line of diamond was discovered in the spectrum. Using a 140-carat diamond that was borrowed from the Maharaja of Darbhanga, Bhagavantam, one of Raman’s pupils confirmed this result and also recorded the complex luminescence spectrum around 4152 &lt;span&gt;Å&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raman says this about diamonds,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;
“With their perfect geometric forms and their smooth lustrous beauty they look absolutely fresh from nature’s crucible, although actually taken from sedimentary formations a thousand million years old. The strongly marked curvature of the crystal faces and the smoothly rounded edges are a surprising feature of these crystals”
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/science_day_raman_ketan_images/raman_diamond.PNG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Sir C. V. Raman with beloved diamond
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In continuation with his work on diamonds, he also carried out pioneering studies of the thermo-optic behavior of other solids, their photo-elastic and magneto-optic properties, fluorescence, second order Raman effect, infrared spectroscopy, etc.
&lt;strong&gt;It is perhaps not well known that X-ray topography was discovered in this laboratory while studying the imperfections in diamond.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also worked on lattice dynamics, visual perception and many more topics and made contributions in those areas. It is almost impossible to give a complete description of his diverse research interests and achievements in a single article. More elaborate descriptions about the scientific works of Raman can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ia803102.us.archive.org/6/items/cvramanpictorial00bang/cvramanpictorial00bang.pdf&quot;&gt;“C.V. Raman : A pictorial biography”&lt;/a&gt; a compilation by S Ramaseshan and C Ramachandra Rao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pioneer-of-scientific-research-in-india&quot;&gt;Pioneer of scientific research in India&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout his career, Raman played an integral role in the development of the Institutes that he was part of. During the early 1900s, most of the Indian universities were teaching universities. There was a general belief that new science can not grow in the country and all the young bright minds were sent abroad for ‘training’. Raman, setting his own example, &lt;strong&gt;cultivated the culture of scientific research in India.&lt;/strong&gt;
He made an active effort to bring the best minds in the world, like Max Born, Schrodinger, Ewald, Peierls, Kuhn and many more to India. He thought, bringing such great minds could start a scientific movement in the country. Unfortunately, only Max Born could accept his invitation.
Raman founded &lt;strong&gt;the Indian Academy of sciences&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;1934&lt;/strong&gt; with the main objective of &lt;strong&gt;promoting progress and upholding the cause of science&lt;/strong&gt;. Central to this mission was to publish scientific monographs and journals through which research discoveries could be disseminated worldwide. The proceedings of the Indian Academy of sciences was considered as one of the top journals up until the 1950s. The annual meetings of the academy, so called &lt;strong&gt;‘traveling circus’&lt;/strong&gt;, were the main source of science encouragement in the country, with Raman usually being the &lt;strong&gt;star performer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the academy publishes &lt;strong&gt;twelve journals&lt;/strong&gt; in different areas of science and science education, in addition to &lt;strong&gt;more than fifty books&lt;/strong&gt; that have been published over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
