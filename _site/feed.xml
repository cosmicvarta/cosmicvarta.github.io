        <title>Spreading the joy of science - The science outreach activities during the Young Astronomer’s Meeting, 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A summary of science outreach performed during the Young Astronomer’s Meeting, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human mind is always curious and questioning. It has a very compulsive behavior of asking “why,” “how,” and sometimes “what if?”. As Farhan Akhtar sings in the movie Rock On!! (2008), &lt;em&gt;“Why is the sky blue, why is the water wet, and why is the Earth round? Socha hai? Ye tumne kya kabhi?”&lt;/em&gt;, meaning &lt;em&gt;“Have you ever thought of this?”&lt;/em&gt;. Curiosity is one of the most fundamental qualities of humans and is unbridled in children. Children ask questions that are sometimes startlingly profound - “Why is the North of a magnet attracted to the South?”. Such questions are crucial to understanding the world around us and the very nature of our existence!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science is generally approached in schools as a collection of facts about the world, with a smattering of numerical problems. However, this is hardly the case. Science is a method or a prescription for understanding the world. Typically, we perceive (see or hear or taste, for example) the world and are driven by an innate curiosity as to how the world functions. To answer this curiosity, we come up with reasons – some may be correct, but others may be utterly wrong. How do we decide this? Through the scientific method! Each reason may give rise to multiple testable results, which we then compare against the things we see or infer. We keep updating our different “reasons” if they fail and try to come up with a general picture of the world. If any person tests out these different “reasons,” they should also come up with the same answer – and then we would know if our understanding of the world is correct!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Young Astronomers Meet (YAM) is a meeting of &lt;strong&gt;only research scholars&lt;/strong&gt; in astronomy and astrophysics in India. This meeting is of the scholars, for the scholars, and by the scholars. After a “coronal hiatus,” the meeting was held this year at the Aryabhatta Research Institute of observational sciencES (ARIES) in Nainital between 9th-13th November. As research scholars aiming to be professional scientists in the future, we ought to share our understanding, enthusiasm, and excitement about the scientific analysis of the world with everyone. With this in mind, the YAM committee organized a series of outreach activities aimed mainly at school children. The unbridled enthusiasm and curiosity of school children are an excellent motivator for the research scholars who were on the other side just a decade ago. The outreach activities were initiated by Dr. Virendra Yadav of ARIES/ASI-POEC and brought into shape by Mr. Atharva Pathak of Pune Knowledge Cluster, who was earlier with the IUCAA Science Popularization team. Along with the two experts were the YAM chair Vivek Jha, YAM coordinator Dimple, and YAM SOC member/ CosmicVarta editorial team member Vishal&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, who edited and finalized the outreach program. This complete team had almost more than 15 research scholars who volunteered from purchasing materials to conducting outreach!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-initial-outreach-session&quot;&gt;The initial outreach session&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the schools had requested outreach sessions for a specific range of classes. For example, students between classes 6th to 8th formed one batch, and those from 9th to 12th included another. On the first day of YAM, we were yet to receive a full confirmation from various schools which had been approached. One school – Dikshant International, Haldwani – had confirmed the outreach session for both batches on the 10th of November, 2022. So on the 9th, Atharva, Virendra, Dimple, Vivek, and I sat down with the set of experiments and demonstrations of IUCAA Scip-pop brought by Atharva. Every region, every school, and every batch is unique. Hence, we selected an initial set of demonstrations suitable for the two batches of students. The initial preparation was extremely important – the demonstrations had traveled all the way from Pune to Nainital and had to be in perfect condition to work. Thus, we narrowed down a couple of demonstrations and presentations to be showcased to the students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team on the first day was led by both Atharva and Virendra. It consisted of Sreetama Das Choudhury and Samik Mitra from IIT Guwahati, Priyesh Tripathi from ARIES, Ajay Kumar from NCRA, Pune, and myself. The outreach started with the senior batch students, to whom Virendra introduced astronomy and ARIES. This was followed by a set of demonstrations led by Atharva and the volunteers, involving participation from the crowd as “student volunteers.” A part of the team then led these students for sunspot observations through the 5” Cassegrain telescope. The junior batch students were presented with most of the demonstrations – however, this crowd was more challenging to control, with the time running short. Thus, while the volunteers conducted the demonstrations, each step and reasoning was interactively performed, with the students sometimes shouting an answer in unison! Finally, these students were shown sunspots through the telescope, and the sessions concluded with an informal interaction with the outreach team and teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/outreach_activities_yam_vishal/image1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;learning-from-feedback&quot;&gt;Learning from feedback&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sessions at Dikshant International were a big hit and taught us many things. First, the younger students were typically chaotic and easily fascinated by science experiments – especially those making a lot of noise or being disruptive. These kids were not very interested in any presentation unless it was highly captivating. Second, the older students showed a greater inclination toward the presentations. Furthermore, the presentations were effective if they were relevant to the experiment being performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had confirmed attendance at four schools the next day (11th November). Since the demos were limited in number, we had to select demos that may be showcased at these different schools and make multiple copies of each demo for each school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking all this data, we formulated a plan of action. The subsequent sessions would have the sunspot observation as the epicenter, and from thereon, we would diversify to different topics. Each session would first start with sunspot observations, giving an observational treat. Next, we would have a presentation on sunspots with lots of visuals. Then, we change tracks to the experiments: (i). Demonstration of magnetic levitation – an extension of the magnetic nature of sunspots, (ii). Mixing of different colours of light, and the meaning of “electromagnetic spectrum” (iii). The demonstration of transverse and longitudinal waves and energy transfer using a slinky-like construction (iv). The dependence of pitch of the sound on the length of the air/water column, using two demonstrations, (v). Concave and convex mirror and lens demonstration, and (vi). The application of an astrolabe to find the coordinates of objects in the sky. The session would then end with slides on ARIES and YAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our demos confirmed, we needed to replicate them. Volunteers from ARIES stepped up to perform the purchase. The demonstrations are constructed with simple, day-to-day objects: colored papers, pencils, plastic straws, sponges, and protractors, for example!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/outreach_activities_yam_vishal/image2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Session planning, demonstration construction, and presentation curation by the YAM attendees. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there were four schools with four volunteers per team, we needed around 16 volunteers for our team. The YAM attendees enthusiastically turned up to volunteer for the outreach and were split into different teams. Each team had a lead and a set of volunteers trained and readied for the outreach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;large-scale-outreach-session&quot;&gt;Large-scale outreach session&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two large cars containing two teams each left ARIES early in the morning after breakfast on the 11th. The schools gave timings for conducting the sessions, so we had to ensure there was correct coordination, for we only had two telescopes for four schools. The outreach plan was to go to the first school, perform sunspot observations, and let the second team take the telescope to the next school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four schools that had requested outreach were Shemford, Sacred Heart, Aurum Global, and Aryaman Vikram Birla Institute of Learning. Atharva, Virendra, Gourav, and I led the teams at different schools. In Atharva’s team were Eshita Banerjee (IUCAA) and Kiran Wani (ARIES), while in Virendra’s team were Sayak Dutta, Suraj Dhiwar (IUCAA), and Vikas Rawat (ARIES). Gourav Banerjee of CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Bangalore led Anju Panthi (BITS Pilani), Mizna Ashraf (IISER Tirupati), and Arpit Kumar Shrivastav (ARIES), while I led Pranshu Kumar, Bhavya Ailawadhi and Prajjwal Rawat from ARIES.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outreach events went almost perfectly according to our plans. Since each team had a leader with prior experience performing science outreach, the teams adapted to the student’s responses. We aimed not just to showcase experiments but to inculcate excitement and develop an innate curiosity about the world. Thus, depending on which demos were well received, the teams tinkered with the order and the set of demos to be presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The junior batch students were extremely chaotic. Navigating the chaotic energy is a major task in itself, but in general, all the volunteers were amazed by the observation skills and thought processes of these kids. The students were attentive to what we spoke about and asked some questions which, at a scientific level, were quite profound! Also, we noticed that the little things we do significantly impact kids with confidence issues. A little encouragement to such kids to come onto the stage and perform the demos has quite an impact on these kids. In fact, some of these kids stayed much later to chat with us and thanked us for giving them an opportunity on stage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 12th of November, a final outreach session was planned for senior batch students at Longview Public school with the same demos. This school was not in the plains of Haldwani but rather in the mountains of Nainital. This session was undertaken by Virendra, Kiran, and Pranshu and joined by Srashti Goyal of ICTS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;wrapping-up-and-next-steps&quot;&gt;Wrapping up and next steps&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The science demos we created for individual schools were given away to these schools to let the teachers perform such demonstrations. In most schools, the teachers showed as much enthusiasm as the students while the demos were underway. This is critically important in inculcating love, excitement for the scientific process, and a general curiosity about the world. Dr. Virendra Yadav, the co-chair of the Outreach team of the Astronomical Society of India, presented a summary report to ASI on the conducted outreach sessions. The team of volunteers hopes that the YAM outreach becomes a standard template of outreach to be followed as a part of any conference/meeting occurring within India; looking forward to increased participation and sharing our scientific enthusiasm!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Astronomers find cold atomic gas playing peek-a-boo around a powerful quasar</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The interaction of radio jets with gas associated with the host galaxy could play an important role in determining their morphology.  Such interactions may be more prevalent at high redshifts, when these powerful AGN are still the assembly sites of giant galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/cold_atomic_gas_powerful_quasar_neeraj/image1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Fig. 1 The canonical model of AGN (&lt;a href=&quot;https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/active_galaxies1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Credit: Aurore Simonnet, Sonoma State University&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most luminous sources in the Universe. Their energy output is fuelled by the supply of gas to the central engine, i.e., a supermassive black hole (SMBH) through an accretion disk (see Fig. 1).  The detection of Lyman-alpha emission from neutral hydrogen (HI) has established that the powerful AGN at high redshift are embedded in huge (10 - 100 kpc) gaseous halos of diffuse atomic gas.  The observations of absorption lines detected in the spectra of AGN can provide crucial insights into the processes through which gas at large scales can be transported to the circumnuclear disk to fuel the central engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2022ApJ...927L..24G/doi:10.3847/2041-8213/ac589f&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gupta et al.(2022, ApJL, 927, L24)&lt;/a&gt; recently used the Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salt.ac.za/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT)&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa and &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vlba/introduction-to-vlba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)&lt;/a&gt;  in the USA to discover a curious case of high HI column density absorber that exhibits strong HI 21-cm absorption at radio wavelengths but is absent at optical wavelength! SALT is the largest single optical telescope in the southern hemisphere whereas VLBA is a radio interferometer  consisting of 10 identical antennas, separated by distances from 200 km to transcontinental 8600 km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/cold_atomic_gas_powerful_quasar_neeraj/image2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Fig. 2 HI 21-cm absorption line associated with the powerful AGN M1540-1453.  Note that the HI 21-cm line (rest frequency of 1420.405752 MHz) is redshifted to ~456.2 MHz.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The large reservoir of cold HI gas associated with the quasar M1540-1453 at the redshift of z = 2.104 was discovered using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gmrt.ncra.tifr.res.in/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT)&lt;/a&gt;  in India.  The corresponding HI 21-cm absorption profile is shown in Fig. 2.  It doesn’t exhibit any unusual features except that such absorbers have been difficult to find at high redshifts and only four are known at z &amp;gt; 2.  To understand the origin of detected cold gas, Gupta et al. observed M1540-1453 with SALT to detect the strong Lyman-alpha (Lyα) absorption corresponding to the gas detected with uGMRT.  But to their surprise, no such absorption was detected in the optical spectrum (see Fig. 3).   Also, in comparison to typical quasars, the Lyα emission line associated with the AGN is much narrower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/cold_atomic_gas_powerful_quasar_neeraj/image3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Fig. 4 VLBA image revealing the diffuse radio morphology of M1540-1453.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison to optical, in general the radio emission associated with AGN is much more spatially extended. This difference can be used to explain such ambiguities in the radio and optical spectra. To dissect this further and understand the &lt;em&gt;ghostly&lt;/em&gt; nature of this HI absorber, Gupta et al. observed M1540-1453 with VLBA.  Usually, one expects radio emission associated with such powerful AGN to exhibit well collimated radio jets and lobes (see Fig. 1). However, the milliarcsecond-scale resolution observation of M1540-1453 shows a diffuse morphology (Fig. 4), which implies that the gas in front of it, which is producing absorption, is also not a few localized gas clumps, but rather forms a clumpy shell or halo which could be as large as 10 kpc (see Fig. 5). It is conjectured that this HI shell represents infalling gas clouds that may have been blown by the interaction between radio jets and the host galaxy medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/cold_atomic_gas_powerful_quasar_neeraj/image5.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Fig. 5: Cartoon depicting a quadrant of M1540–1453 embedded in a clumpy ISM. The quasar’s optical sight line (dashed line) may not intercept infalling HI clouds. In comparison, extended radio emission (&amp;gt; 425 pc) from the lobes will be intercepted by several such clouds, producing the broad redshifted HI 21 cm absorption line. The extent of the HI halo and radio emission could be as large as 10 kpc.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quasar M1540-1453 was discovered through an ambitious spectroscopic survey using SALT (180 hrs) and the Nordic Optical Telescopes (6 nights) to build a purely infrared-selected sample of radio-loud quasars (RLQs) at z &amp;gt; 1.5 and define the footprint of &lt;a href=&quot;https://mals.iucaa.in/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey&lt;/a&gt;  (MALS; PI: N. Gupta).  MALS is one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ska.ac.za/science-engineering/meerkat/observers/observing-programme/large-survey-projects/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the ten large surveys&lt;/a&gt; being carried out with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ska.ac.za/science-engineering/meerkat/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; the MeerKAT radio telescope&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa. In the coming years, MALS is expected to detect several such absorbers that may have escaped detection at other wavelengths, and address various fundamental issues related to AGN.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A comparison of the properties of Narrow Line and the Broad Line Seyfert galaxies</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;AGNs are very luminous objects at the centre of active galaxies. The inner regions of these galaxies can not be resolved directly, yet the understanding of these regions can be achieved by employing indirect methods. In this study, we employed a statistical approach to understand a very peculiar class of AGN with respect to the general AGN population- the Narrow Line Seyfert galaxies, and have found out that emission line region outflows exist in the innermost regions of these AGN which adds another peculiarity to their behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent discoveries have pointed out that a supermassive black hole (SMBH) exists in the centre of the galaxies, with mass ranging from a million to a billion solar masses. This central black hole accretes matter at a very high rate. In turn, an accretion disk is formed and it radiates a luminosity ranging from a billion to a trillion times the luminosity of the Sun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These kinds of galaxies are called active galaxies, or more popularly these objects are called Quasars. Quasars were discovered to be very luminous extragalactic objects only in 1963, through the work of Martin Schmidt. In research, various names: Active galactic Nuclei (AGN), Quasars, Blazar, Seyferts, etc. are known (see this for detailed information about the Quasars). Commonly, people use AGN as a generic term, while Quasar is used for AGNs having higher luminosities (&amp;gt; 1e44 ergs/sec). Seyferts are the AGN that are a little less luminous than Quasars. Type-1 AGN are the ones where the observer is able to view the innermost regions comprising the accretion disk and the BLR without any obscuration, while in the Type-2 AGN, the dusty torus obscures the innermost regions. 
Among the type 1 Seyferts, a peculiar class of galaxies known as the Narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies is known to exist. These are young AGN, with very high accretion rates. The study of these objects provides clues to the understanding of the formation and growth of AGNs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The Unified Model for AGN accounts for various properties observed in AGN. This simple model differentiates between the various classes based on the orientation with respect to the observer.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we have studied the properties of these NLSy1 galaxies as compared to the general type-1 AGN which we term Broad-line Seyfert galaxies (BLSy1) galaxies. We achieved this by collecting optical spectra for a sample of about 260 galaxies. We searched for the spectra in the publicly available SDSS database. SDSS provides information for hundreds and thousands of such objects on their server. We assembled a set of 144 NLSy1 and 117 BLSy1 galaxies which are in a similar luminosity and redshift range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
The multiple-component spectral decomposition was applied to fit one of the sources in this study.(&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09150&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Image courtesy&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After fitting the spectra by employing a multi-component spectral decomposition technique, we studied a set of 11 physical parameters to compare these two populations. It is very important to know that the exact relation of the NLSy1 galaxies with the BLSy1 galaxies remains unknown for the general AGN population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We characterized the population of these galaxies based on the asymmetry observed in a very prominent emission line: the H-beta emission line. In our sample, we found out the NLSy1 galaxies are 3 times more likely to show emission line asymmetries as compared to the BLSy1 galaxies population. This result is very important in our understanding of the difference between these two populations. Note that the emission lines are generated in the Broad-line Region (BLR) of these AGNs, and this region cannot be resolved by any observation technique at present. Thus, we are reliant on indirect tools to infer the dynamics of matter in these regions. In this regard, emission line asymmetries encode information about the dynamics of matter at the location from where they are emitted and thus it becomes necessary to characterize. The outflows may also be due to the winds arising from the accretion disk in these AGNs, which influences our understanding and further modelling of the AGN accretion disks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We calculated the Spearman rank correlation coefficients among the parameters. We found that the accretion rate characterized by the Eddington Ratio is anti-correlated with the FWHM of the H-beta emission line which means the AGNs which are accreting at a faster rate, will have narrower emission profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, we ran a Principal component analysis (PCA) on the data to understand the parameters deriving the correlations and anti-correlations. Basically, PCA reduces the dimensions of the dataset in the sense that what we were able to derive based on 11 physical parameters, we could do with fewer principal components. This helps us understand the underlying correlations among the fewer parameters. Based on the results from the PCA, we find out that the Eigenvectors 1 and 2 of the PCA are a bit different for both populations. What can be the possible reason behind this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, based on an ensemble study of around 500,000 AGN, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13712&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shen et al. 2014&lt;/a&gt;  reported the same Eigenvector correlation as has been observed in this study. This is significant because it points out that AGN located in different redshifts and luminosity bins show similar properties which can be arranged to form a sort of main sequence. The main sequence is a very neat way to arrange the population of stars based on the luminosities and their age. A similar main sequence for the AGN has been proposed based on this correlation.
Are the Eigenvectors telling a different story? We don’t know yet. However, we can safely say that the NLSy1 galaxies form the extreme end of the AGN population with very high accretion rates and low SMBH masses. The discovery of significant emission line asymmetries in the NLSy1 galaxies means that outflowing gas is indeed present in the line emitting regions. Similar studies covering a larger population will be very helpful in our understanding of the peculiarity of these AGNs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3.6m DOT discovered unexpected kilonova emission from a long-duration gamma-ray burst</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are flashes of high-energy radiation arising from energetic cosmic explosions. Bursts of long (greater than two seconds) duration are produced by the core-collapse of massive stars, and those of short (less than two seconds) duration by the merger of compact objects, such as two neutron stars. A third class of events with hybrid high-energy properties was identified, but never conclusively linked to a stellar progenitor. The lack of bright supernovae rules out typical core-collapse explosions, but their distance scales prevent sensitive searches for direct signatures of a progenitor system. Only tentative evidence for a kilonova has been presented. Here we report observations of the exceptionally bright GRB 211211A, which classify it as a hybrid event and constrain its distance scale to only 346 megaparsecs. Our measurements indicate that its lower-energy (from ultraviolet to near-infrared) counterpart is powered by a luminous kilonova possibly formed in the ejecta of a compact object merger. To study the aftermath of this long GRB, we used several telescopes in space and on Earth, in which the 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope of the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) played a significant role.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some massive stars die as the brightest and most explosive astrophysical sources in the universe, known as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). GRBs are powerful astronomical bursts of high-energy gamma-ray radiation and are one of the most interesting and scientifically fulfilling phenomena studied in modern astronomy. GRB events have two distinct emission phases: one is the short-lived prompt emission (the initial burst phase, that emits gamma-rays), followed by a long-lived multiwavelength afterglow phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few decades, based on the observed time scale of prompt emission, astronomers have generally divided GRBs into two categories: long and short-duration GRBs, respectively. Long GRBs typically emit gamma rays for two seconds or more. They are associated with the death of very massive stars and are sometimes associated with supernovae. On the other hand, Short GRBs emit gamma rays for short periods of less than two seconds. This class of GRBs is formed when pairs of very dense celestial bodies (compact) - such as neutron stars or black holes - merge with each other, rotating in a spiral form over a period of billions of years. They also generate gravitational waves. In recent years, scientists have discovered a special phenomenon called a kilonova of visible and infrared light with short-period GRBs. According to a possible scientific hypothesis, the heat produced by the radioactive decay of heavier elements may emit kilonova. This process, known in physics as the r and s process, also produces heavier elements such as gold and platinum. However, observing kilonovas at near-infrared wavelengths is technically challenging, and only a few telescopes on Earth have been useful. The 3.6-meter Devasthal Optical Telescope (see Figure 1) of the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), is one such telescope that is  sensitive enough to detect kilonova and optical/near-IR counterparts of gravitational wave objects at these wavelengths up to faint limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 11, 2021, NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected a burst of high-energy light (GRB 211211A) from the outskirts of the Milky Way located approximately 1 billion light-years away. To study the aftermath of this long GRB, astronomers used several telescopes in space and on Earth, in which the 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope of the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) played a very important role (see Figure 2). The spectral energy distribution of GRB afterglow is usually explained in terms of non-thermal emission (due to synchrotron radiation). However, in this event, both thermal and non-thermal emissions are included in the spectral energy distribution of the afterglow, modeled using the magnificent and dim observations of the 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope. After subtracting the afterglow contribution from the collected data taken using the 3.6 m telescope and 4Kx4K CCD IMAGER, the scientists found that the multiwavelength data could be well explained by additional thermal spectra and that this thermal emission could be explained in terms of kilonova emission. &lt;strong&gt;This is the first astronomical event in which a long GRB has been accompanied by the unexpected discovery of a kilonova emission&lt;/strong&gt;, and  has shaken the understanding of scientists. In this event, the high-energy outburst lasted about a minute, and follow-up observations taken from the 3.6-meter Devasthal Optical Telescope identified a kilonova. Observations by the 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope have provided information on the earliest phase of a kilonova ever detected. In addition to the first data taken by the 3.6-meter telescope, this scientific discovery, published in the journal &lt;strong&gt;Nature&lt;/strong&gt;, also used Hubble Space Telescope, Multicolor Imaging Telescopes for Survey and Monstrous Explosions, Calar Alto Observatory, Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope, and many other space and ground-based telescopes. This discovery will help in understanding the process of the formation of heavy elements in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Several years ago, Neil Gehrels, an astrophysicist, and namesake of Swift suggested that some long-duration GRBs may be produced by merging neutron stars,” said Eleonora Troja, an astrophysicist at the University of Rome who led the team on the study. By GRB standards, this event was relatively nearby, allowing space and ground-based telescopes to capture the dim light of the kilonova. Kilonovae may also arise from more distant long GRBs, but we have not yet been able to see them through observations. PI of the 4Kx4K CCD IMAGER mounted on ARIES’ 3.6-meter telescope, senior Scientist Dr. Shashi Bhushan Pandey, along with research students Rahul Gupta, Amar Aryan, Amit Kumar, and Senior Scientist Kuntal Mishra, contributed significantly to the discovery of this milestone event published in the journal Nature on 07-12-2022 at 16:00 (London time). Dr. Shashi Bhushan Pandey and the team of Indian scientists involved in this work said that this discovery challenges our current understanding of the origin of GRBs and gives rise to new possibilities in this thrust area of research. Professor Dipankar Banerjee, director of ARIES, pointed out that future time-domain astronomy has a unique potential to make a lot of such discoveries using the 3.6m Devasthal optical telescope.&lt;/p&gt;

The scientists from the ARIES, an autonomous institute of DST, used data from 3.6m DOT, in studying the aftermath of the long GRB (GRB 211211A), detected by NASA&apos;s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope on December 11, 2021. The high-energy outburst lasted about a minute, and follow-up observations taken from the 3.6-meter Devasthal Optical Telescope identified a kilonova. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discovery opens new questions regarding the origin and classification of GRBs. These sources’ unique gravitational wave signatures could be the key to unraveling the mystery. The gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA did not detect GRB 211211A, as these detectors were offline for advancements. Suppose  gravitational wave detectors can see a long-duration GRB after they begin operating again in 2023. In that case, the combination of gravitational wave and electromagnetic data may solve the mystery of this newly discovered event.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fantastic beasts and where to find them: the elusive nature of X-ray quiet black holes</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With the gravitational wave observations capturing the coalescence of compact objects, hunting for black holes has taken quite a front-row seat in astronomical observations. Here, we discuss two such detection of black holes in orbit with a main sequence companion, and why it is very difficult to find them in the forest of massive stars.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massive stars are objects that are more massive than eight times the mass of our Sun (M⊙). They play an essential role in the evolution of our Universe. They enrich the void between stars with matter via strong winds and provide mechanical feedback. However, many aspects of massive star evolution are still unconstrained, such as their wind mass-loss rates, the mixing efficiency inside their surface, and their death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massive stars that are heavier than ~20 M⊙ are thought to collapse directly to form black holes. Expectantly, there are many uncertainties such as the mass range for black hole formation, the natal kick imparted during the black hole formation due to asymmetric collapse,
and the spin of the resultant black hole. The gravitational wave detectors have already observed ~90 compact object merger events involving black holes and neutron stars. However, more than a million black holes are predicted to be present in our Galaxy itself, waiting to be discovered. So, observationally detecting a large sample of black holes can shed necessary light on their formation properties and their subsequent evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empirically, massive stars have been observed to exist in binaries and higher order multiples, with about three out of every 100 massive star binary above 10M⊙ expected to harbour a black hole as its companion. However, a large fraction of these binaries that will eventually form double compact object binaries will not merge within the current age of our Universe. Hence, they will remain unobservable in the current gravitational wave surveys. Nevertheless, progress can be made to discover these black holes while they are in orbit with a massive star companion, where they are detectable via alternative methods. This is possible, for example, by measuring the X-ray emission from the accretion disk of the black hole, the radial velocity variations in the spectral lines&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of the massive main sequence companion, and through periodic astrometric variations&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or photometric variability&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of the massive star companion induced by the black hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black holes in binaries are thought to form from the collapse of massive Wolf-Rayet stars, which are very hot and bright stars that show emission lines in their spectrum. Now, there are many observed Wolf-Rayet+O star binaries in our Galaxy (~80) compared to observed black hole+O star binaries (only one, Cyg X-1). To resolve this disparity, it was recently suggested that black holes receive a significant natal kick when the Wolf-Rayet stars collapse to form a black hole, disrupting the binary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since black holes do not emit any light of their own, we need to rely on the indirect ways discussed above to observe a black hole. The most common method has been to detect X-rays from the accretion disk around the black hole in a binary with the O star companion. Some of the wind matter from the companion gets attracted by the gravity of the black hole, and if that matter falling into it has enough angular momentum, it can form a disk before being engulfed by the black hole. The matter then swirls around the black hole multiple times, gets heated up to millions of degrees, and gets hot enough to emit X-rays. Bondi, Hoyle and Lyttleton did pioneering work in this field in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we find that such wind accretion in our black hole+O star binary models is not expected to lead to observable X-ray emission. Only in exceptionally favourable cases, such as high angular momentum accretion efficiency and low wind velocities, can an accretion disk form, leading to observable X-ray emission. Moreover, the formation of an accretion disk is also biased towards binaries containing rapidly spinning black holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first-born black hole in a massive binary is expected to be slowly spinning due to efficient angular momentum transport inside a star. The wind velocity of O stars is very high (~2000 km/s), empirically verified through observations. Detailed hydrodynamic calculations predict only one-third of the angular momentum available is accreted by the black hole. Hence, most black holes in orbit with an O star are not expected to form an accretion disk and remain unobservant via X-ray telescopes. So, the discrepancy in the number of observed Wolf-Rayet+O star binaries in comparison to black hole+O star binaries may be due to the lack of observability of the black hole binaries in X-rays. We conclude that high black hole natal kicks are not necessary to explain the scarcity of observed high-mass X-ray binaries. Instead, searching for black holes via alternative methods may be more fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One alternative would be to search for black holes in our Milky Way via astrometric variations in visible stars - that is, variations in the precise measurements of the position of stars in the sky. This method has been shown to be very promising as our Milky Way is expected to harbour millions of black holes in orbit with main sequence companions whose astrometry can be carried out in principle by the GAIA telescope. Unfortunately, the GAIA Data Release 3 did not have the relevant data for stars massive enough to host black holes, and hence this method could not be pursued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus in this work, we look at radial velocity variations of observed massive stars. We have a nearly complete census of the massive star content in the Tarantula nebula of Large Magellanic Cloud, which enables us to also carry out precise number statistics for the massive stars in this region. In fact, it is the most active star-forming region known in the Local Group of galaxies containing very massive stars with a metallicity resembling the peak of star formation in our Universe. The radial velocity of stars is measured by observing the Doppler shift in a prominent spectral line of the star. As the star moves around in one full orbit, the spectral lines are blue-shifted for half of the orbit and red-shifted for the remaining orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we see a Doppler shift in a spectral line of a stellar object both towards the bluer and redder wavelengths simultaneously, we identify the object as a double-lined spectroscopic binary. This is because both the components of the binary are responsible for creating the Doppler shifts in opposite directions, one moving towards us in orbit and the other away from us. When we see a Doppler shift in only one direction, we identify the object as a single-lined spectroscopic binary. This is because the companion star is usually too faint for its spectral line to be detected. Or, in the most interesting case, the companion is a compact object which does not emit any light of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identify the single-lined spectroscopic binaries in the sample of massive stars observed in the Tarantula region. The VLT Flames Tarantula Survey observed approximately 800 massive stars, out of which 300 were O-type stars. From these, around 100 targets that showed radial velocity variations were followed up in the Tarantula Massive Binary Monitoring Survey. Of these, 51 of them were categorised as single-lined spectroscopic binaries. Through follow-up spectral disentangling, we retrieved hidden spectra in 43 of these targets. For the remaining targets where we were not able to find a non-degenerate companion, three of them had an estimated minimum mass of the unseen companion above 4M⊙.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the above, we were able to find unambiguous evidence for the presence of a 9.1M⊙ object in the system named VFTS 243. The orbital period of this system is 10.4  days and the orbit is also circular. Through follow-up rigorous analysis, we arrive at the conclusion that the object is a black hole, the first one detected in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The system is also X-ray quiet, in agreement with our earlier study on the X-ray emission from black hole + main sequence systems. The above number statistics show how big an observing program needs to be undertaken to unambiguously find black holes via radial velocity monitoring of observed massive stars. In the Milky Way, we have found another system, HD 130298, that could be another candidate to host a stellar-mass black hole. Our journey towards identifying a population of X-ray quiet black holes has only started, and we aim to slowly but surely hunt them down, through future observational surveys, one black hole at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Precise Measurement of Flux Density of Radio Emissions from the Sun using Day-time Celestial Radio Sources</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;During astronomical observation, astronomers measure the amount of energy emitted by astronomical objects. This energy is generally measured in terms of the flux density of the source. At radio frequencies, these measurements are calibrated using calibrator sources, which have known constant flux densities. Since the Sun is about 1000 times brighter at radio frequencies than the calibrator sources, estimating the flux density of the solar radio emission is challenging. With the new generation radio telescope, the Murchison Widefield Array, it is now possible to observe the faint background radio sources simultaneously with the Sun. This is the first such an observation has been made, which seems like “observing stars in the day”. Using these background radio sources it is now possible to estimate the flux density of the solar radio emission with much better accuracy, which is important to understand the emission mechanisms of solar radio emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most physics experiments, researchers measure various quantities in different units, like the mass of a body measured in grams, the length of an object measured in centimeters, and so on. Similarly, Astronomers also measure different quantities during astronomy observations, which can be used to understand the physical properties of that astronomical object. In astronomy, measurements are done in some well-defined units, like any other area of physics. One such important quantity in astronomy is the &lt;em&gt;flux density&lt;/em&gt;, which defines the amount of energy received per unit of time from astronomical sources if collected over a unit area and unit solid angle for a monochromatic emission. At radio wavelengths, the unit of this flux density is &lt;em&gt;Jansky (Jy)&lt;/em&gt;, named after the pioneer of radio
astronomy, Karl. J. Jansky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an astronomer observes the radio emission from a celestial object using a radio telescope, the tiny amount of incident radio emission is converted into electronic voltages by the very sensitive electronic instruments of the radio telescope. The corresponding power generated by these very tiny voltages is recorded in some arbitrary units. But, to understand the physical processes happening on that celestial object, astronomers need to convert this measured power into the units of &lt;em&gt;Jy&lt;/em&gt;. The process to convert this is known as flux density calibration. Precise measurement of the flux density in units of &lt;em&gt;Jy&lt;/em&gt; is essential to properly measure other physical properties, like distance, size, temperature, and so on, of that astronomical source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is routinely done using a bright radio source with a well-pre-defined flux density. These are called calibrator sources. While observing the Sun at radio wavelengths, this standard approach does not work. The flux density of the Sun is about 1000 times more than the brightest celestial radio source in the sky. Like at the optical wavelengths, it is tough to observe the background sources in the sky at radio wavelengths when the Sun is in the sky. Hence, to obtain the flux density of the Sun at radio wavelengths, solar physicists have used different laboratory measurements of the properties of the instrument to estimate the flux density of solar radio emission. But those estimations had comparatively large errors in the flux density.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;observing-stars-in-the-day&quot;&gt;Observing Stars in the Day&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/flux_density_radio_emission_devojyoti/image1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Fig. 1 : An image of the daytime sky at radio frequency (80 MHz). The image is made from the observations taken with the instrument called the Murchison Widefield Array, which can observe a large, about 2500 square degrees of the sky at a time. The red circle in the image marks the Sun. All small white dots in the image are background sources
emitting radio frequencies, including stars, galaxies, quasars, pulsars, and others.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For precise flux density calibration of solar observation, several background radio sources with well-known flux densities must be observed during the daytime. This is extremely challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite great challenges, a team of solar physicists from NCRA, led by Devojyoti Kansabanik, have successfully observed more than 80 background radio sources with the Sun in the field of view (FOV) of the telescope using images having a dynamic range of 1000. The dynamic range is the ratio between the brightest and faintest emission detected in the image. They used one of the most advanced telescopes in the world, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), situated in the western Australian desert, to make this high dynamic range image. This image is shown in Figure 1. A red circle marks the Sun, and all other small white dots are the radio emissions from background stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies. They detected more than 80 sources with the Sun in the sky. This is the first time such an image of a daytime sky is made, which seems like &lt;em&gt;observing stars in the day&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;precise-measurement-of-flux-density-of-the-radio-sun&quot;&gt;Precise Measurement of Flux Density of the Radio Sun&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kansabanik et al. use these background radio sources to estimate the flux density of the radio Sun. The known flux density of these sources is obtained from the GLEAM survey and determines a scalar number for each source to match their flux density obtained from the image with the previously known values. They have found that these scalar numbers are constant for the full image. Hence, the same scalar number can be used to obtain the true flux density of the Sun in units of &lt;em&gt;Jy&lt;/em&gt;. This method allows them to measure solar flux density with a precision of 10 %, which is about 3 to 6 times more precise than the previous method developed by Oberoi et al. 2017. They also found that the 10% error is mostly coming from the error on the known flux densities from GLEAM of these radio sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kansabanik et al. also devise a method exploiting the extreme stability of the MWA. They demonstrated that a very precise solar flux density could be obtained only using an analytical function of frequency without using any dedicated observation of flux density calibrator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;importance-for-future-observations-of-the-sun-and-heliosphere&quot;&gt;Importance for Future Observations of the Sun and Heliosphere&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As said earlier, astronomers use precise flux density measurements to estimate several physical parameters of the celestial source. The radio emission from quiet solar corona or coronal mass ejections can be used to measure those media’s temperature, magnetic field, and electron properties. The estimated values of these plasma parameters strongly depend on the precision of the flux density measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides achieving precise flux density measurement, the first-ever successful detection of a large number of faint background radio sources makes it possible to observe the heliosphere close to the Sun using a wide FOV instrument, which is otherwise impossible. These sources and their polarized emission can be used in the future to measure the magnetic field in interplanetary space. When a large amount of plasma is erupted from theSun in the form of a CME and crosses the background sources, its polarization properties get changed by the magnetic field of the CME plasma. A similar phenomenon can be observed when magnetized solar wind passes through the line of sight of these background sources. The changes in polarization properties of them can be an efficient method to measure the magnetic field in the heliosphere over a larger region, which is rather challenging and only limited to some vantage point measurements directly from a handful of spacecraft. Work is currently underway to use the polarization properties of these sources to achieve this objective.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vainu Bappu Observatory: the telescope town of India</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A popular article describing the history and contributions of the Vainu Bappu Observatory: the telescope town of India.&lt;br /&gt;
My affair with the observatory is also highlighted in brief.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development of astronomy in ancient civilizations like during the times of Babylonians, Greeks, Egyptians, etc. took place due to some fundamental needs. Some of these needs were predicting seasons precisely which helped the ancient people in agriculture, using the night sky for proper navigation while travelling in uncharted areas without having any compass or clock, fixing the time for religious rites, etc. The earliest recorded astronomical observations date back to around 1600 BCE by Babylonians, much before the beginning of the Christian era. As time progressed, advancement in astronomy took place gradually. And in parallel to this, an overall progress in science and technology also occurred. History shows that studying astronomy has generated fundamental knowledge which has benefited every human being through ages. For example, the discovery of gravitation by Newton led to the understanding of planetary motion, which further laid the foundation of space technology – a boon of science which has benefited almost every human being. STD phone, mobile, internet, etc. are some of the results of the development of space technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, invention of telescope and then studying the sky with bigger and better telescopes stationed in different astronomical observatories has greatly helped in this progress of astronomy since the past few hundred years. Encyclopedia Britannica defines an ‘astronomical observatory’ as “any structure containing telescopes and auxiliary instruments with which to observe celestial objects”. Like different other countries, India also possesses a long tradition of astronomy since ancient times [1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing in the present day twenty-first century, India possesses several world-class research institutes and observatories carrying high-class researches in astronomy. One such important astronomical observatory situated in Indian soil is the Vainu Bappu Observatory, a place which one can truly be considered as the ‘Telescope City of India’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;vainu-bappu-observatory-vbo-telescope-city-of-india&quot;&gt;Vainu Bappu Observatory (VBO): Telescope city of India&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 200 km south-west of Chennai and 175 km south-east of Bangalore, in the Tirupathur district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu lies the picturesque Javadi hills. Amidst this forested vegetation, near the neighborhoods of the village known as Kavalur and at an altitude of around 750 m (longitude 78° 49.6’ E; latitude 12° 34.6’ N) is located the Vainu Bappu Observatory (VBO) – one of the most important and active astronomical observatories in India and also in Asia. Situated away from light pollution and hustles-bustles of any big city, VBO is operated by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spread over an area of 40-hectare, this place attracts astronomers and researchers from across the country who are involved in studying celestial objects like stars, exoplanets, galaxies, etc. and also engineers, operators and other staff members who look after the proper functioning of the observatory. Apart from these busy and always cheerful people, VBO is filled with a variety of greenery of tropical region besides a number of medicinal plants. This is because the area is inside a protected forest. Monkeys are regular visitors among animals. And occasionally, appearance of some wildlife like deer, snakes and scorpions also greet the people working inside the campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the location of VBO provides advantages for night sky observation for astronomers. Apart from being reasonably away from city lights and industrial areas, this particular location was chosen in order to be closer to the Earth’s equator. Thus, coverage of both northern and southern hemispheres with equal ease becomes possible. Moreover, the longitudinal position of VBO is such that it is the only major astronomical facility between Australia and South Africa for observing the southern celestial objects [2].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;establishment-of-vbo&quot;&gt;Establishment of VBO&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VBO traces its root far back in history. I shall discuss here in brief about how it was established. The first astronomical observatory in India was established at Madras (now Chennai) in 1786 by the East India Company “for promoting the knowledge of astronomy, geography and navigation in India.” It became the premier institute in India for works on the fundamental positions of stars during the 19th century.  A catalogue of 11, 015 southern hemisphere stars was produced by the Madras observatory in 1843 under the guidance of T.G. Taylor, the then Director of the observatory. This is the famous Madras Catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research in planetary science and stellar astronomy at the Madras Observatory reached its peak during the latter half of the 19th century, under the leadership of Norman Pogson, the Director of the observatory during 1861-1891. With his Indian assistants Pogson measured accurately the positions of around 50, 000 stars, discovered six variable stars and six asteroids during this period. In 1867, an Indian astronomer, Chintamani Ragoonathacharry (1838-1932), an assistant of Pogon, discovered a variable star– R Reticuli. This is probably the first recorded astronomical discovery by an Indian in the era of telescopes.  Then, during the Total Solar Eclipse on August 18, 1868, the first spectroscopes were used to observe an eclipse event. So this eclipse became an important landmark which signaled the birth of solar physics in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Pogson’s death (June 23, 1891), initiatives were taken to establish a separate solar physics observatory. Following the decision, Kodaikanal Solar Observatory was established at Kodaikanal, Tamilnadu within few years. It started working officially on April 1, 1899. However, due to the climate it was understood that Kodaikanal can provide very few nights available for observation. In 1945, the Government of India appointed a committee, chaired by the eminent physicist Meghnad Saha which started planning the post-war development of astronomy in India. Manali Kallat Vainu Bappu, a great visionary who took over as the director of the Kodaikanal Observatory in 1960 knew that Kodaikanal is not a suitable place for stellar research. However, establishing an observatory for stellar studies and optical astronomy was the dream of M.K. Vainu Bappu. So he led a search since 1962 for finding a suitable site in southern India for establishing an optical observatory. He succeeded in finding a sleepy little hamlet i.e. Kavalur in the Javadi Hills as a suitable site for establishing optical telescopes for observing celestial objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observations began in 1968 with a 38 cm telescope made in the backyard of the Kodaikanal Observatory [3]. Then in 1971, a fully autonomous research institute was formed under complete funding from the Government of India, which came to be known as the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) [4]. Located in Bangalore, IIA took over the VBO facility henceforth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;facilities-at-vbo-2-5-6&quot;&gt;Facilities at VBO &lt;i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[2, 5, 6]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presently, VBO boosts of a number of sophisticated telescopes and asoociated instruments for looking at the heavens. The historical 1-m Carl Zeiss reflecting telescope, the 2.34-m Vainu Bappu Telescope, the recently installed 1.3-m J.C. Bhattacharya Telescope forms the major facilities. The first telescope was of 38 cm (15-inch) aperture, with which astronomical observations were started in 1968 at VBO. Later, a 75 cm (30-inch) telescope was completely designed and fabricated at the workshops of the IIA. It is still used for observations at VBO. Another 45-cm aperture joined the arsenal within few years. In recent years, one more telescope, known as the ‘DIMM Telescope’ also stands tall in the campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/vainu_bappu_telescope_town_gourav/image2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in 1972, a 1.02-m (primary mirror diameter) class reflecting telescope made by Carl Zeiss Jena was installed at VBO. Having the Ritchey-Chretien F/13 optical configuration, this remained as one of the primary facility for observing celestial objects for over a decade. It is working fully till now and is attached with two instruments for observations, a stellar optical polarimeter and the Universal Astronomical Grating Spectrograph (UAGS). Anyone of them can be used at a time attaching with the telescope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on January 6, 1986, another 2.34-m (93 inch) diameter reflecting telescope was inaugurated in the observatory. Completely designed and built in India, this telescope project was started by Vainu Bappu. However, he passed away in 1982 and could not see the successful installation and working of this dream telescope. On January 6, 1986, the observatory was renamed as the Vainu Bappu Observatory and the 2.3-m telescope as ‘Vainu Bappu Telescope’ (VBT) [6]. It remained as the largest telescope in Asia until a 3.6-meter telescope was set up at Devasthal, near Nainital, by ARIES. It is majorly used for deep sky observations including stars and galaxies currently using two instruments at prime focus. It is operated as a national facility and attracts proposals from all over the country and occasionally from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another recent addition to these existing facilities is the 1.3-m aperture J.C. Bhattacharya Telescope, popularly known as the JCBT. It was installed in April 2014 and was named after the ex-Director of VBO, Dr. Jagadish Chandra Bhattacharya. Possessing a Ritchey-Chretien F/8 optical configuration, JCBT has three instrument ports. The main port consists a 2k x 4k CCD system for direct imaging purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;major-discoveries-and-research-highlights&quot;&gt;Major discoveries and research highlights&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributions of VBO in astronomy are immense. This included some major discoveries which are discussed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 1-m telescope started producing fruitful results just within few months after it began operation in January, 1972. In June, 1972, it discovered the presence of a thin atmosphere around Ganymede, the largest satellite of Jupiter [7].&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In March, 1977, rings of Uranus were discovered by J. C. Bhattacharya (Director of VBO after M. K. Vainu Bappu) and his colleagues while observing through the same telescope [8].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/vainu_bappu_telescope_town_gourav/image6.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then in 1984, the discovery of a thin outer ring around Saturn was reported by VBO using the same telescope [9].&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another important discovery was made using the 45 cm Schmidt telescope. On February 17, 1988, a new minor planet was discovered by a team of six astronomers led by R. Rajamohan [10]. It was a part of a special search program for asteroids called ‘Project Kalki’. Later, this asteroid was named ‘4130 Ramanujan’ after the legendary Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. This became the first discovery of an asteroid from the Indian soil in the 20th century.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another notable work performed from VBO was to survey the stars of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) galaxy using ultraflow dispersion spectroscopy. Moreover, astronomers of IIA started observing the famous supernova of 1987, i.e. SN1987A in LMC within 48 hours of the discovery. Observing this supernova in details using both 1-m and the 75 cm telescopes, despite its low elevation in the southern sky, proved the importance of the geographic location of Kavalur. Apart from these major achievements, front-line research is carried out at VBO in present days also, using different focal plane instrument facilities. Research at VBO focuses in observing and studying most of the areas of optical astronomy viz. solar system objects, stars, star clusters, galaxies, stellar explosions, blazars, optical imaging of gamma-ray burst fields, etc. Communication facilities via the VSAT satellite connection are available for every user for the telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;vbo-and-me-a-personal-account&quot;&gt;VBO and me: a personal account&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large number of Indian observational astronomers owe a lot to VBO. Many of the major projects leading to PhD by observational Indian astronomers have been carried out using data obtained from the VBT, or at least any one telescope facility from VBO. I am also one among those numerous researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My official tie-up with VBO started since October, 2017. Being an MPhil scholar of astrophysics at the CHRIST (Deemed to be University), I started observing a carefully selected sample of classical Be (Be hereafter) stars using the historical 1-m telescope at VBO. It was a study where I, my supervisor and co-supervisor collaborated with IIA. Continuous monitoring of these stars was necessary for few years to study the disc formation and dissipation timescales in Be stars. I fell in love with the serene beauty, wonderful co-operative staff members of the campus from the very first days. And then started a never forgettable journey of my life. The same project became a part of my PhD thesis which I led as the Principal Investigator since February 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, we received over 150 nights of observation to obtain the spectra for our selected stars. A total of 61 nights I myself have stayed at VBO doing the observations, which would have definitely increased if COVID19 did not hit the world. I can truly say that these 61 nights of my life were among the best ones I have experienced. It was during my stay at Kavalur I was able to work for over 12 hours a day, in a calm and quiet place without any man-made disturbances. This was the place where I was able to complete a major portion of my analysis works related to MPhil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whole night of observations was a routine schedule when the only sound was originated from the chirpings of monkeys, and the murmurs of insects mixed with an un-describable drizzling sound of leaves of trees due to mild breeze. Morning arrived with excellent views of sunrise and amazing roars of innumerable birds. The days passed by mostly sleeping and taking care of my belongings from the anytime invaders – the monkeys. Occasional appearance of scorpions and snakes was also not something unusual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the most beautiful periods of spending at VBO, I presume, is during the summers, especially April. Apart from clear skies, almost the entire campus becomes colorful with the arrival of flowers in the treetops. For me, working in such an environment was like a childhood dream come true, a dream which turned to love and then into passion ultimately setting my aim – to become an observational astronomer studying the stars. I do cherish these wonderful days spent in the midst of telescopes, jungles, warm people and serene nature while working for my MPhil and then PhD. As an astronomer in near future, I would definitely love to maintain my attachment with VBO, forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rapid development of technology, presently we are actually standing in a golden era of astronomy. Apart from the VBO, India currently possesses several world-class research institutes and observatories carrying high-classresearches in astronomy. One such observatory is the Indian astronomical Observatory (IAO) located in the remote village of Hanle, Ladakh in the Jammu &amp;amp; Kashmir district. Situated at a height of 4, 517 meters from the sea level, this place was found to be a world-class astronomical site for establishing a large optical telescope. IAO was started in 2001 and contains the 2-m (200-cm) aperture Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), which was dedicated to the nation in August 2001. Like the VBO, IAO is also operated by IIA, Bangalore. The HCT facility can be operated from a remote control centre at Hoskote, around 35 km from Bangalore, making it one of the most powerful remote controlled telescope facility of the world. The HCT is being used to study several types of celestial objects and phenomenon including stellar spectroscopy, galactic and extra-galactic star forming regions, young stellar objects, star clusters, supernova, gamma-ray bursts, etc. During the past decade, different other facilities such as the 0.7-m wide field robotic telescope (under the GROWTH project), Himalayan Gamma Ray Array (HAGAR), imaging Cherenkov telescope (MACE) have come up due to the infrastructure developed by IIA at the IAO site. The site is also being characterized for another 10-m class telescope which is a future project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participation in international projects was also envisaged in the Astronomy and Astrophysics “Decadal Vision Document 2004” sponsored by the Indian Academy of Sciences and the Astronomical Society of India. Development and successful operation of ASTROSAT - India’s first astronomy satellite was a major achievement in the past decade. Moreover, India is now playing an active role in participating in different future world class megaprojects related to astronomy. India-TMT, LIGO-India, SKA (Square Kilometer Array) are some such highly ambitious projects, whereas Aditya L1, NLST, INSIST, Gaganyaan are some of the future space missions to study various objects and phenomenon of the universe. Plans to send future missions to the Moon and Mars are also under consideration. Hence, one can understand that India’s future in astronomy seems truly promising. Now, it is up to the intellect of motivated young Indians whether we will be able to exploit these facilities fully and hence, will be able to carry forward the astronomy tradition of India or not.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What makes radio-quiet AGN radio-quiet? A polarization perspective</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There is a lack of consensus on the origin of radio emission in radio-quiet (RQ) and radio-intermediate (RI) AGN. Primary contenders include low-power radio jets, winds, star-formation and coronal emission. Our multi-frequency, multi-scale radio polarization study has revealed a multi-component (jet + ‘wind’), stratified radio outflow in the two intermediate AGN, III Zw 2 and Mrk 231. Each strata of the outflow has a characteristic magnetic field geometry. Our radio polarization study in conjunction with the [O III] emission-line study of five RQ quasars have provided insights into the interplay of jets, winds and emission-line gas. A close interaction between the different emission components themselves as well as with the local host environments is likely responsible for the stunted nature of the radio outflows in RQ and RI AGN. Our findings are also consistent with the idea that radio-loudness of a source is a function of its epoch of observation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic and extremely luminous phenomena in the Universe. They emit radiation at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. This radiation which is of non-stellar origin is believed to originate from supermassive black holes (BHs; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; − 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; M⊙, the mass of the sun; see review by &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.aa.22.090184.002351&quot;&gt;Rees, 1984&lt;/a&gt;) as matter accretes onto them through an accretion disk. The different constituents of an AGN, some of which have been inferred indirectly from multi-wavelength continuum and spectroscopic observations, include (see Figure 1):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a BH at the centre of the host galaxy,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an accretion disk,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a hot magnetized corona presumably located above the accretion disk,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;high velocity and dense gas clouds (known as the broad line region or BLR) which give rise to the broad emission lines in the optical spectra,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;low velocity and relatively less dense gas clouds (known as the narrow line region or NLR) which give rise to the narrow emission lines in the optical spectra,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an obscuring torus of gas and dust that hides the BLR clouds from sight for certain viewing angles (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139170901&quot;&gt;Peterson, 1997&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1086/133630&quot;&gt;Urry &amp;amp; Padovani, 1995&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/radio_quiet_agn_polarization_silpa/image1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 1: The standard model of AGN from &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1086/133630&quot;&gt;Urry &amp;amp; Padovani, 1995&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small fraction (10−20%) of AGN also launch relativistic, powerful and collimated structures called jets at radio frequencies (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1086/115207&quot;&gt;Kellermann et al., 1989&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0301309&quot;&gt;Urry, 2003&lt;/a&gt;). These jets are launched perpendicular to the BH-accretion disk interface and extend over scales ranging from a few hundred kiloparsecs (kpc) to several megaparsecs (Mpc). This class of AGN is called the radio-loud (RL) AGN. On the other hand, the majority of AGN (80−90%) launch weak and small-scale radio jets that typically extend to less than 10 kpc. Alternatively, they may also host broadly collimated wind-like or diffuse radio outflows. These constitute the radio-quiet (RQ) class of AGN. The division between RL and RQ AGN is mathematically shown in terms of the radio-loudness parameter (R) given by &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1086/115207&quot;&gt;Kellermann et al. (1989)&lt;/a&gt;, which is the ratio of radio flux density at 5 GHz to optical flux density in the B-band. According to this definition, RL AGN has R &amp;gt; 10 while RQ AGN has R ≤ 10. &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1086/310386&quot;&gt;Falcke et al. (1996)&lt;/a&gt; proposed another class of AGN with intermediate R values (10 &amp;lt; R &amp;lt; 250), known as the radio-intermediate (RI) AGN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;key-concepts&quot;&gt;Key concepts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two widely discussed mechanisms for jet production in the literature include: &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/199.4.883&quot;&gt;Blandford &amp;amp; Znajek (1977)&lt;/a&gt; mechanism, hereafter referred to as BZ77 and &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/199.4.883&quot;&gt;Blandford &amp;amp; Payne (1982)&lt;/a&gt; mechanism, hereafter referred to as BP82. In BZ77, the jets are produced by electromagnetic extraction of energy and angular momentum from a spinning BH, while in BP82, the energy and angular momentum are magnetically extracted from the accretion disk. The origin of radio emission in RL AGN is often attributed to the BZ77 mechanism while the origin of radio emission in RQ and RI AGN is poorly understood. It is not clear if their emission mechanism is that of BZ77 or BP82 or both. The possible scenarios for radio emission in RQ AGN as proposed in the literature include low-power jets, winds, star-formation, coronal emission, and a combination of them (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-019-0765-4&quot;&gt;Panessa et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the open questions on jet physics that we are trying to address include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where are the jets launched from?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What causes the collimation of jets?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the jets composed of?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why are the jets in RQ and RI AGN stunted or small-scale as opposed to the large-scale jets in RL AGN?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radio emission from the jets is basically the synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic electrons spiraling around the magnetic (B) field lines. Synchrotron emission from an individual electron is highly confined to a narrow cone pointing towards the direction of the electron motion (a process known as “beaming”), and radiation from an ensemble of relativistic electrons is intrinsically linearly polarized. Radio polarization observations can provide information about the orderliness and orientation of the B field giving rise to the synchrotron emission. According to the synchrotron theory, the inferred B fields are parallel to the electric polarization vectors for optically thick regions like the core while perpendicular, in the case of optically thin regions like the jets, lobes and hotspots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards briefly addressing the key questions listed above, we carried out a multi- frequency, multi-scale radio polarization study of the RI Palomar Green quasar, III Zw 2 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab1870&quot;&gt;Silpa et al., 2021a&lt;/a&gt;) as well as of a quasar that is currently transitioning from the RQ to RL state, viz., Mrk 231 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab2110&quot;&gt;Silpa et al., 2021b&lt;/a&gt;) with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and the Very Large Array (VLA). We find a stratified radio outflow in these sources, which could either be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a “spine-sheath” structure in the radio jet, where the ‘spine’ refers to a narrow relativistic jet component and the ‘sheath’ refers to a broader sub-relativistic jet component, enclosing the spine; or&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a ‘jet + wind’ composite structure, where the ‘wind’ component could either be a magnetized accretion disk wind or the outer layers of a broadened jet (like a jet sheath) or a combination of both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find that each component of the stratified outflow has a characteristic B field geometry. Theoretical models emphasize on the importance of helical B fields (which comprise of poloidal and toroidal field components) for the production and propagation of jets. From our study we find that the inferred B fields are parallel to the local direction of the radio outflow in case of the jet spine/jet component while they are transverse in the case of the jet sheath/wind component (see Figure 4). The parallel inferred B fields represent the poloidal component of the helical field while the transverse inferred B fields represent the toroidal component (e.g., see Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/radio_quiet_agn_polarization_silpa/image2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the uGMRT, we also detect a kpc-scale radio lobe to the south in III Zw 2 (annotated as ML in Figure 3) that is misaligned with the primary lobes (annotated as NEL and SWL in Figure 3). Based on the two-frequency spectral index image and electron lifetimes estimated using the “equipartition” equations (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1086/165182&quot;&gt;O’Dea &amp;amp; Owen, 1987&lt;/a&gt;), we find that the misaligned lobe emission does not arise from any past activity of AGN. Rather it is being actively fed by the nucleus through intermittent fueling, similar to the large and ‘alive’ radio lobes observed in the radio galaxy M87 at 330 MHz with the VLA (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1086/317151&quot;&gt;Owen et al., 2000&lt;/a&gt;). The lobe characteristics, such as a mean spectral index between −0.6 and −0.7 and a lack of clear spectral steepening with distance from the core, are also similar to those of the ‘sputtering’ AGN, NGC 3998 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201936796&quot;&gt;Sridhar et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;), suggesting that the AGN in III Zw 2 is similarly ‘sputtering’. We also note that the curved VLA jet in III Zw 2 terminates in ‘bow-shock-like’ radio structures on either side, instead of compact hotspots typically seen in Fanaroff–Riley Class II radio galaxies. A similar feature is seen in the restarted jet simulations of &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1086/169762&quot;&gt;Clarke &amp;amp; Burns (1991)&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting the presence of restarted jet activity in III Zw 2, possibly on very short time scales, ranging in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

The length of these vectors is proportional to polarized intensity and the orientation of the vectors is determined by the polarization angle. The regions with longer ticks are highly polarized regions while the regions with shorter ticks are less polarized regions. NEL refers to the north-eastern lobe, SWL refers to the south-western lobe and ML refers to the misaligned lobe in III Zw 2.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As already mentioned, RQ and RI AGN are known to be powered by multiple radio emission processes. It is a good exercise to estimate the relative contributions of the individual processes towards the overall budget of the radio emission. This exercise can be carried out for sources that have multi-scale, multi-frequency radio data since different emission components will be sampled at different resolutions and frequencies. We carried out a similar study for Mrk 231, and we have been able to obtain first-order estimates of the relative contributions from the weakly collimated jet, AGN-driven wind, and starburst-driven wind to the total radio emission observed. Our results suggest that while the starburst-driven wind accounts for ∼ 10−20% of the total radio emission, both AGN wind and the weakly collimated jet contribute significantly to the rest of the emission in Mrk 231.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the radiation propagates through the magneto-ionic medium (i.e. composed of free charges and B fields) between the source and the observer, the two orthogonal components of the electromagnetic wave interact differently with the local free charges. This results in different refractive indices and speeds of propagation for the two components, which in turn induces a delay between them that shows up as a rotation of the plane of polarization. This phenomenon is called Faraday rotation. Owing to the effect of Faraday rotation, the intrinsic polarization angle differs from its observed value by an amount that depends on the square of wavelength. The constant of proportionality is called rotation measure (RM), which physically depends on the line-of-sight component of the B field, and the electron number density and path length of the Faraday-rotating medium. Based on the 3-frequency RM images of Mrk 231, we find that the radio outflow in this source becomes increasingly matter-dominated away from the core, suggesting that the synchrotron plasma mixes with the entrained gas as the radio outflow (jet/lobe and/or wind) propagates through the ambient medium. Thus, the role of the local environments is important to consider while studying AGN outflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study carried out on a small sample of RQ quasars with the radio polarization data from the VLA and the [O III] emission-line imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we find that the polarized radio emission is more often spatially anti-correlated with [O III] emission (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac1044&quot;&gt;Silpa et al., 2022&lt;/a&gt;). A similar anti-correlation has been observed in RL AGN in the literature (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1086/161594&quot;&gt;van Breugel et al., 1984&lt;/a&gt;) where it has been suggested that the radio emission is depolarized by the emission-line gas. We find evidence for mixing of the entrained thermal gas with the synchrotron plasma in the lobes of these sources, which could be resulting in the internal depolarization of the lobe emission. The anti-correlation between polarization and emission-line gas could be interpreted as a signature of the jet/wind-gas interaction and possibly a source of AGN feedback in these sources. AGN feedback is a process by which the energy and matter are transported from the central engine to the interstellar medium of the host galaxy via AGN outflows like jets and winds, with an effect of either heating and/or expelling the star-forming material or enhancing local star- formation (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1016/j.newar.2011.11.003&quot;&gt;Alexander &amp;amp; Hickox, 2012&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-astro-081811-125521&quot;&gt;Fabian, 2012&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.3389/fspas.2017.00042&quot;&gt;Morganti, 2017&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-018-0403-6&quot;&gt;Harrison et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;discussion&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a close interaction between the multiple components of the radio outflow (jet and wind) and the surrounding gaseous environment may be producing stunted jets in RQ and RI AGN. Drawing analogies from X-ray binaries, we propose a model in Figure 4 that demonstrates a possible connection between the spectral state changes (hard/soft) of the accretion disk and the nature of radio outflows in different radio classes of AGN. In this model, the outer regions of the accretion disk are in soft spectral state, and are characterized by the thermal emission from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-010-2585-0_13&quot;&gt;Shakura &amp;amp; Sunyaev (1973)&lt;/a&gt; disk, which is an optically thick and a geometrically thin disk. The magnetic flux accumulation close to the BH is not efficient enough for the launching of powerful radio jets in case of the thin accretion disk. Therefore, this state produces suppressed radio jets, and strong winds that could either be driven by the BP82 mechanism or could be a jet sheath (see Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the inner regions of the accretion disk are in hard spectral state, and are characterized by an advection-dominated accretion flow (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1086/187381&quot;&gt;Narayan &amp;amp; Yi, 1994&lt;/a&gt;), where the energy, instead of being radiated away, is advected into the BH during accretion. This state facilitates the accumulation of magnetic flux close to the BH, and therefore produces a powerful and steady radio jet or the jet spine, driven by the BZ77 mechanism (see Figure 4). Such a co-axial outflow would appear co-spatial in projection, as seen in our sources. It is very likely that the different emission layers like the jet spine/jet and the jet sheath/wind interact with each other (this refers to the region between BZ77- and BP82-driven components in Figure 4). Consequently, this may either disrupt the jet, or most of the mass and energy may be carried away by the wind rather than the jet. This could result in low-powered, small-scaled jets seen in RQ and RI AGN, as opposed to the large-scaled, powerful jets in the RL AGN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 4: A cartoon to illustrate a possible connection between the changing spectral states of the accretion disk and the multi-component radio outflow in AGN, as inferred from our work on RQ and RI AGN (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab1870&quot;&gt;Silpa et al., 2021a&lt;/a&gt;). The white ticks denote the B-field vectors.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, the transition between the hard and soft spectral states in regular RL and RQ AGN occurs on time scales of 106 − 108 yr (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/225.1.1&quot;&gt;Alexander &amp;amp; Leahy, 1987&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20000198&quot;&gt;Enßlin &amp;amp; Gopal- Krishna, 2001&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13459.x&quot;&gt;Shabala et al., 2008&lt;/a&gt;). However, this may occur on much shorter time scales, like decades, in intermittent/sputtering AGN sources. Such rapid transitions may explain the co-existence of a jet of moderate radio luminosity with an accretion disk wind in such sources. Furthermore, this model is in support of the idea that radio-loudness is a function of the epoch at which the source is observed (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09194.x&quot;&gt;Nipoti et al., 2005&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab9598&quot;&gt;Kunert-Bajraszewska et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08872&quot;&gt;Nyland et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;). This could imply that the RQ AGN are the sources which are in soft state, launching strong winds and suppressed jets, and RL AGN are the sources which are in hard state, launching powerful jets, at the time of their observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key takeaways from this article are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RQ and RI AGN are likely powered by multi-component radio outflows (jet + ‘wind’). Signatures of possible outflow stratification emerge from the different inferred magnetic field structures in the polarization observations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A close interaction between the different emission components themselves as well as with the local host environments may be the reason for the stunted nature of the radio outflows in RQ and RI AGN. 
The radio-loudness of a source may be a function of its epoch of observation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Gravitational Waves in an Inhomogeneous Universe</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Space is quite inhomogeneous at small scales. These inhomogeneities may play a significant role in governing the physical phenomena at this scale. Here we have analysed the impact of these inhomogeneities on the Gravitational Wave (GW) observables. For this analysis we have made use of a toy model of the inhomogeneous spacetime. Our analysis shows that the amplitude of GW gets affected by these inhomogeneities and this effect is governed by our model parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cosmological Principle states that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic at large scales. Various surveys like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sdss.org/&quot;&gt;Sloan Digital Sky Survey&lt;/a&gt; have revealed &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-pdf/443/1/241/4292640/stu1118.pdf&quot;&gt;deviations from homogeneity on samples as large as 500 h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc&lt;/a&gt;. In comparison, &lt;a href=&quot;https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/milkyway_info.html&quot;&gt;Milky Way galaxy is about 30 kpc across&lt;/a&gt;. These inhomogeneities play an important role in governing the physical phenomena at this scale. The physical phenomena that we have considered here is the propagation of Gravitational Waves (GWs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GWs have been a fascinating feature of Physics ever since &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/3527608958.ch7&quot;&gt;Einstein&lt;/a&gt;
predicted their existence. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/gravitational-waves&quot;&gt;GWs are ripples in spacetime&lt;/a&gt;
produced when the acceleration of the second mass moment of the associated motion of a system of masses is non-vanishing. This is valid provided higher order moments are neglected. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March01/Carroll3/Carroll6.html&quot;&gt;TT (transverse traceless) gauge&lt;/a&gt; this second mass moment is given by the quadrupole moment. These waves move outwards from their source. Before reaching the observer these waves propagate through the spacetime. In this work, we have analysed how the amplitude of these GWs gets affected by the inhomogeneities present in spacetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;formalism&quot;&gt;Formalism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To study an inhomogeneous spacetime, a suitable averaging procedure is required. In this work, we have used &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1001800617177&quot;&gt;Buchert’s averaging procedure&lt;/a&gt;
proposed by Thomas Buchert. Buchert’s approach was to first decompose Einstein’s equation into a set of dynamical equations for scalar quantities using Raychaudhuri equation and then average those scalar quantities. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/pram/069/01/0049-0076&quot;&gt;Raychaudhuri equation is concerned with the kinematics of flow.&lt;/a&gt;
Using Einstein’s equation and Raychaudhuri equation ensures that the procedure is GR compliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our analysis we have used a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2006/11/003&quot;&gt;toy model&lt;/a&gt;
based on Buchert’s averaging procedure. This toy model presents a simplified picture of the inhomogeneous spacetime where a domain of space has been divided into two types of regions - one overdense region and one underdense region. Here, overdense region is a closed, dust only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/journey-cosmos-flrw-metric-friedmann-equation/&quot;&gt;Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker&lt;/a&gt;
(FLRW) region while the underdense region is an empty FLRW region. The physical interpretation of this toy model is that the domain of space of our toy model represents the spacetime through which GW is propagating. The overdense region is the matter filled region that the GW encounters in its path while the underdense region is the region of cosmic void.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two parameters governing our model; &lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,the volume fraction of the underdense region and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, the factor governing the time evolution of the scale factor for the underdense region. For the overdense region, there is also &lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, the volume fraction of the overdense region, which is related to &lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; by the relation: &lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; = 1. These parameters completely determine our toy model. The intervening region between source and observer through which GWs propagate can have any combination of this (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;). Therefore we have used different combinations of (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) for our analysis. Using Buchert’s averaging procedure and this toy model, we can calculate various averaged scalar quantities for the domain under analysis, like averaged density, averaged Hubble parameter, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our toy model is a theoretical model. In order to check the validity of our analysis, we need to relate the quantities calculated using our toy model with observational quantities. This is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2009/02/011&quot;&gt;Covariant Scheme&lt;/a&gt;
comes to our rescue. It relates the theoretically calculated quantities from our toy model, averaged density of the domain and averaged Hubble parameter of the domain, with angular diameter distance &lt;i&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, an observational quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The redshift-dependent part of GW amplitude is given by,

  \[A = {(1+z)^{5/3} \over D_L},\]
  
  where z is the redshift factor and \(D_L\) is the luminosity distance which is related to angular diameter distance by the relation,
  
  \(D_L = (1+z)^2 D_A.\)
  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have plotted this quantity &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; for different combinations of our model parameter in Figure 1 &amp;amp; Figure 2 and we have related these plots with the homogeneous &lt;b&gt;Λ&lt;sub&gt;CDM&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; plot as well. Figure 1 shows that for a certain combination of our model parameters, the plot for our inhomogeneous toy model is very close to the plot of homogeneous &lt;b&gt;Λ&lt;sub&gt;CDM&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; model. As we vary our model parameters from this particular combination, the plot for our toy model starts deviating from the plot of the &lt;b&gt;Λ&lt;sub&gt;CDM&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; model and this deviation increases as we vary our model parameters more and more from that particular combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows that for only one particular combination of (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, the plot for our toy model is very close to the homogeneous &lt;b&gt;Λ&lt;sub&gt;CDM&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; plot. For all other combinations of (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, there is substantial deviation from the homogeneous &lt;b&gt;Λ&lt;sub&gt;CDM&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; case. This shows that inhomogeneities in spacetime play an important role in the propagation of GWs and therefore should not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study shows that the inhomogeneities present in the spacetime have substantial effect on the observables of GWs traversing through this spacetime. Our present analysis should inspire further studies of the effect of inhomogeneous spacetime on various other physical phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;

It was a wonderful year indeed.
Today, we take a look back at our journey and briefly talk about our future plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astronomy and Astrophysics&lt;/strong&gt; as a subject has the potential to remove the barriers between people and unite them in a hope of understanding the cosmos. However, even though cutting-edge research is being carried out across India, a communication gap exists between the researchers and the younger students as well as the general public who may not be familiar with the technical details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the hope of bridging this gap, came together a group of enthusiastic PhD students from various research institutes across India and &lt;strong&gt;CosmicVarta&lt;/strong&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;
