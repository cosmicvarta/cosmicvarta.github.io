        <title>Why are some jets curved: presence of dancing blackholes?</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A small percentage of the ejected hot plasma flows (the jets) from supermassive blackholes are observed to deviate from their intended path, resulting in unusual jetted morphologies. One of these peculiarities appears when the jet starts to dance /precess around an axis, forming curved jets with &lt;strong&gt;S-shaped&lt;/strong&gt; morphology. When we observe such sources through radio telescopes, we see a massive S-like structure floating in the vast cosmos. Due to their peculiar morphology, the formation mechanism of such sources is still debated. Simultaneously, an increasing number of such sources are being discovered with even more complex S-shaped structures, making the unravelling of the underlying physics more difficult than earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blackhole is a voracious cosmic giant that feeds on surrounding matter to grow. Its gravitational pull  is so strong that anything that enters inside a certain radius (known as event horizon), finds no way  out, not even the fastest thing in this universe; the light photons. There is no limit to how large a  blackhole can grow in size. The largest of them are supermassive blackholes (nearly a billion times  more massive than the sun; SMBH), which are found at the centres of galaxies. Some of these SMBH  enter into an active phase (not yet fully understood how), during which they accrete matter  (surrounding hot ionised gas/plasma) at an accelerated rate, with some of this material being violently  ejected down the SMBH’s spin axis due to a complex process caused by a powerful magnetic  disturbance. The super-heated plasma material that is thrown out traverses a distance ranging from  sub-parsec to a few megaparsec in space with a velocity nearing the speed of light. Just to compare with our usable scales, one parsec is 3.26 light-years (a distance that light travels in a year). These  ejected streams of matter are called jets, which are destined to propagate along a straight path while  carrying the magnetic field from their origin. As a result, they mostly emit radiation at radio  frequencies due to the synchrotron process (a process where charged particles radiate when they  move in curved paths in magnetic fields), and hence we need radio telescopes to observe and study  them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small percentage of these ejected hot plasma flows (the jets) are observed to deviate from their  intended path, resulting in unusual jetted morphologies. One of these peculiarities appears when the  jet starts to dance /precess around an axis, forming curved jets with &lt;strong&gt;S-shaped&lt;/strong&gt; morphology. When  we observe such sources through radio telescopes, we see a massive S-like structure floating in the  vast cosmos. Due to their peculiar morphology, the formation mechanism of such sources is still  debated. Simultaneously, an increasing number of such sources are being discovered with even more complex S-shaped structures, making the unravelling of the underlying physics more difficult than  earlier. Some examples of these radio sources are highlighted below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To uncover the underlying mechanism that produces these sources, I, along with a team of Indian  scientists, have conducted a study where we tried to numerically (using computer simulation) reproduce an observed peculiar S-shaped source that has recently been observed using  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aoc.nrao.edu/evla/&quot;&gt;the Expanded Very Large Array Telescope&lt;/a&gt; in New Mexico. The source has a  technical name &lt;em&gt;2MASX J1203&lt;/em&gt;. At first appearance, the jets seem to propagate along a straight line from the compact core of the galaxy (centre of mystery!) and end in hotspots (places where jets  terminate or encounter a major collision with the ambient medium). But afterwards, the jets suddenly  bend in opposite directions, making a structure that looks like a wing. This is why it is called an &lt;em&gt;S shaped winged source&lt;/em&gt;. Our novel simulations have modelled this peculiar galaxy using a precessing  jet and have shown that it is not only the jet precession that causes such ambiguities in morphology  but also the galactic medium through which the jet is travelling shape the structure. The heavy galactic  medium (mostly gas) exerts additional force on opposing jet’s free propagation leading to slowing  down the jet significantly, as well as causing it to be unstable as it propagates to longer distances. The resultant structure, when observed from a fortuitous viewing angle (the orientation angle an object  makes with respect to the observer here on Earth), we see the formation of such peculiar &lt;em&gt;S-shaped  winged&lt;/em&gt; sources on the sky plane; what we see in the sky is just a two-dimensional representation of  three-dimensional objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To elaborate our work a bit more, we have carried out computer simulations by adopting a novel  approach where we modelled not only the observed morphology but also the underlying micro physical processes of this radio structure. To answer the morphological peculiarity of the source, we first built a setup where a precessing jet is being injected from the centre of a realistic galactic medium whose time evolution we have further followed. As time progresses, the precessing jet grows in size, and at time 2.23 mega-year, a fully grown dancing jet is formed. When you see this structure from a  particular angle (the line-of-sight), the structure will appear as an S-shaped source with extended wing-like substructures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/curved_jets_dancing_blackhole_gourab/image5.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must mention that finding this fortuitous line-of-sight angle, as well as the jet parameters that  perfectly mimic the observed source (2MASX J1203) was quite a challenging task. This is because the  existing models that tend to predict these parameters of dancing jets have seemed to ignore the jet  deceleration effects imparted by the ambient medium, which have been self-consistently adopted in  our simulations. As a result, our study pointed out that for a better determination of precessing jet’s parameters, numerical simulations are a better choice. Furthermore, when we started to model the  synchrotron emission part of this structure, we found out that the galaxy is radiating at a higher level  that contradicts the theories if we consider that the hot plasma of the jet is radiating away its energies  via radiation as well as via adiabatic expansion of the whole system with time. This further hint that  the radiating non-thermal particles are somehow getting re-energized, which is keeping the structure  alive for a longer time than what has been anticipated from theories. Using our simulations, we explicitly demonstrated that diffusive shock acceleration is the physical factor that assists the particle  in regaining energy supplied by the generated shocks in the medium. These shocks were formed by  the jet’s supersonic flows (flows that move faster than the sound speed in that medium), which caused  the source to be more active than it should have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant question now arises: why did the jet begin to precess in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we have a water fountain that sprays water to a certain height. Now, if we want to make the  ejected stream of water precess around an axis, one has to externally precess the nozzle from where  water is ejected. Similarly, in our astrophysical scenario, the blackhole that is responsible for jet  ejection has to be precessed by an external force. It has been theorized that a secondary supermassive  blackhole possibly orbits close to the primary one, causing the spin axis of the primary SMBH to  precess. The secondary SMBH came from another galaxy that has recently collided with the existing  one, resulting in two SMBHs in a single galaxy. It has been observed that galaxies do collide with each  other, and in the local Universe, the rate of it is significant too. Hence the systematic dance of the  binary blackholes most possibly have made the jet to precess. In this regard, our numerical simulations have successfully constrained the precession period of the jet, using which one can calculate the  separation of the binary BHs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, only a handful of dual AGNs have been discovered yet, maybe because we are looking at  the wrong sources. Nonetheless, these sources with curved/bent jets can now be the ideal candidates  to look for dual SMBH pairs at their centres, detection of which can further help us better understand  the evolution of supermassive blackholes throughout the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Core-collapse supernova from a possible progenitor star of 100 solar mass</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Supernovae are extreme astrophysical transient phenomena marking the death of stars. In this article, I take you to the journey of the life of a star as massive as 100 times our sun. Through the state-of-the-art simulation tool &lt;strong&gt;MESA&lt;/strong&gt;, we have studied the overall life of a 100 solar mass star and the implications of the resulting supernova. At the time of its birth, the 100 solar mass star is around 10 times bigger than the current size of our sun, while in the last stages of its life, it has evolved to around 1700 times the current size of our sun. The energy released from the resulting supernova from such a massive star would be so powerful that it would take around 100 million Suns shining together for a period of at least a few hundred days.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking up into the sky on a clear and dark night, we can see thousands of stars twinkling. While sleeping on the rooftop of my home in our village during summer days, I used to wonder why the night sky looked similar every night. The stars present in the sky last night used to appear in the sky every other night. Similarly, seeing the constellation Ursa Major (popularly known as &lt;em&gt;Saptarishi Taramandal in Hindi&lt;/em&gt;) shining brightly with its seven visible stars every summer night, I used to scratch my tiny mind about the unchanging nature of the heavens. But, do the heavens remain unchanged? No, not at all! Similar to the lifespan of a human being, every star that we see in the sky has a finite lifetime. Accumulation of cosmic clouds gives birth to stars in the form of spherical blobs by burning hydrogen as fuel in their core. These stars grow older while spreading a tremendous amount of energy in the form of light/radiation and finally die with no active fuel burning left in their core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The death of each star (for less massive stars having masses &amp;lt; 8 M⊙ subjected to mass accretion from a companion) is marked by one final, massive detonation or explosion, and the phenomenon is known as a supernova (SN), an event so bright that even if it occurred in another, very far galaxy, it could be seen from the telescopes available on earth and in space. The only difference between the lifetime of humans and stars is that humans can have a lifespan of around a hundred years or so only, but the stars live for a few million to a few billion years of age! This is the reason why the heavens in the night appear unchanged every night when seen through the naked eyes. However, as I mentioned above, the heavens change, with supernovae (SNe) being one of the means. So, has there been any bright supernova event in human civilizations that could have been seen through the naked eyes? Yes, nine such events have been identified and recorded by human civilizations in the past 2000 years! The first SN event was recorded in 185 A.D. by the ancient Chinese, as referenced in the work of two Roman chroniclers. Around 200 years later, two bright SNe in 386 A.D. and 393 A.D. were also recorded. The fourth one is the most bright SN in human history, which occurred in the year 1006 A.D., an event so bright that it could cast shadows on the ground. The fifth and sixth SNe seen through the naked eyes occurred in 1054 A.D. and 1181 A.D., respectively. The remnant of the SN that occurred in 1054 A.D. is known as the very famous &lt;em&gt;crab nebula&lt;/em&gt;. The seventh and eighth SNe seen through the naked eyes occurred in 1572 A.D. (known as Tycho’s supernova) and 1604 A.D. (known as Kepler’s supernova). The ninth SN seen through the naked eyes occurred just a few decades earlier, in 1987, named SN 1987A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our sun is a star in our galaxy &lt;em&gt;Milky Way&lt;/em&gt; which hosts about a billion other stars, many of them having masses greater or lesser than our sun. Further, in the known universe, there are billions of other galaxies, each of them hosting billions of stars. However, the SNe can be so bright that they can outshine their entire host galaxy and can be seen through the telescopes on earth even if they are occurring in other galaxies (or, in other words, being extra-galactic). Once such SNe is detected through space-based or ground-based telescopes, they are followed up, and their brightness is recorded until they become fainter beyond the detection limits of telescopes. For SN, the variation in brightness (or intrinsic luminosity) over a period of time is called its &lt;em&gt;light curve&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With the state of the art software and simulation techniques, we are now capable of studying the lifespan of a star. We can numerically evolve a certain mass star from birth to death and study its implications. A review of one such work is presented in this article. Here, we have studied the life span of a star as massive as 100 M⊙. Figure 1 shows the change in the size of 100 M⊙ star as it evolves through various phases of its life. This star starts as a relatively smaller blob of gas, evolves to grow bigger, and during its last evolutionary stages, it has grown in size, having a radius of a few 1000 times bigger than our sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/2020fqv_core_collapse_superova_amar_images/image1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 1 : The evolution of the size (measured by its radius) of a 100 solar mass star as it gets birth (left panel), becomes an adult (mid panel), and finally reaches the stage where it is about to die (rightmost panel). The subplot in the left-bottom corner marks the star&apos;s position on HR diagram (which is the variation of luminosity with effective surface temperature). The figures are also color-coded with blue meaning hot and red meaning less hot. These figures have made use of the results from Aryan et al. 2022. (Credits: Author)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last evolutionary stages (approaching its death), the star is mainly composed of inert Iron in its core, and the burning of fuel in the core has almost stopped. Due to this, the core of the star is vacated of any radiation. The role of the presence of radiation in the core of a star is vital as it is the source of radiation pressure responsible for balancing the self-gravity of the core. But, when the core is vacated of almost all the radiations, there is no support to the self-gravity of the core, and it &lt;em&gt;starts to collapse&lt;/em&gt; under its own gravity resulting in a core-collapse supernova.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/2020fqv_core_collapse_superova_amar_images/image2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 2 : (Left )The variation of the core temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;core&lt;/sub&gt;)  and core density (&amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;core&lt;/sub&gt;) as the 100 M⊙ star is born and evolves older to reach the last evolutionary stage reaching on the verge of core collapse. The blue triangle marks the core temperature and density at the birth of the star, while the red solid circle marks the same when the star is on the verge of death. This panel makes use of the results from Aryan et. al 2022. (Right) The light curves of supernovae resulting from the death of a 100 M⊙ star by keeping total explosion energy constant and varying the amount of total nickel mass. For comparison purposes, the light curves of three similar type supernovae are also shown but these three supernovae result from much lower mass (10 - 20 M⊙) stars. This figure has been adapted from Aryan et al. 2022.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left panel of Figure 2 shows the variation of core temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;core&lt;/sub&gt;) with core density (ρ&lt;sub&gt;core&lt;/sub&gt;) as the 100 M⊙ star evolves from its birth (marked by a blue triangle) to the stage where it is about to die (marked by red solid-circle). We could see that near the last evolutionary stages, the core temperature and core density have reached in excess of 1010 K and 1010 g cm-3, respectively. Keeping such high density in a normal human life perspective, a matchbox full of such core material would weigh around 200 million Kg!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right panel of Figure 2 shows the light curves when a 100 M &amp;amp;odot; star explodes as a core-collapse supernova. The resulting SNe are Type IIP-like that are identified by a phase of nearly constant luminosity (also called &lt;em&gt;plateau&lt;/em&gt; phase) in their light curves. The length of the plateau is dependent on the size of the Hydrogen envelope retained by the star. So, we can see that SN 1999em, SN 2005cs, and SN2009N have shorter plateau duration, as they arrive from much lower stars having masses in the range of 10 to 20 M⊙. Further, in the right panel of Figure 2, on increasing the Nickel mass while keeping the explosion energy constant, the duration of the plateau in the light curve is increased. This behavior due to the increase in Nickel mass is attributed to the increase in energy deposition in the expanding ejecta by the γ rays that are produced by the radioactive decay of Nickel (&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Ni) and Cobalt (&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Co). 
One can also notice that the explosions from such a massive star would be so humongous that they would radiate at a rate of 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; ergs/s or more for at least a period of 350 days. Again putting it in an observational perspective, it would be equal to around 100 million Suns shining together for a period of at least 350 days! Thus, the core-collapse supernovae are extreme catastrophic phenomena and are among one of the major events marking the alterable heavens. Keeping these aspects of supernovae in mind, we conclude that the heavens do change. It only requires an eye of a keen observer to see the change!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;India has a long history of more than two decades of observations of optical counterparts of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using Indian meter-class telescopes like the 1.04m Sampurnanand Telescope (ST), 1.3m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT), 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), and 2.34m Vainu Bappu Telescope (VBT) utilizing the longitudinal advantage of the place. In recent times, astronomers started exploring these exciting and explosive astronomical sources using recently commissioned (since 2016) India’s largest optical telescope, i.e., 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) at Devasthal observatory of Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital. In a short period of the proposed target of opportunity (ToO) observations (since cycle 2020-C2), DOT discovered many interesting results such as the detection of long GRB (GRB 211211A) from a neutron star-white dwarf merger, the detection of host galaxies of peculiar GRBs, the detection of most delayed optical flare (GRB 210204A) observed from any GRB so far, etc. This article briefly summarizes the recent discovery of dark (GRB 210205A) and orphan (AT2021any/ZTF21aaeyldq) afterglows of GRBs using 3.6m DOT + 4K × 4K CCD Imager.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to humans, stars also have a life cycle. They are born, live, and at some point, they die. High mass (more massive than eight solar mass) and low mass (typical to solar mass) stars follow a different life cycle. The death of massive stars produces the brightest and most explosive astronomical sources known as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). GRBs are powerful bursts of high-energy gamma-ray radiation and are among the most exotic phenomena studied in modern astronomy. GRB emits more energy in a second than our Sun will emit in its lifetime. GRB events have two distinct emission phases: one is the short-lived prompt emission (the initial burst phase, peak at sub-MeV energy range), followed by a long-lived multiwavelength afterglow phase. The prompt emission (initial gamma-ray emission) of GRBs is automatically discovered by space-based gamma-ray missions such as NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, India’s AstroSat, and many more. Based on the observed time scale of prompt emission, astronomers classify GRBs as long or short, whether the event lasts more or less than two seconds. Their duration is associated with their origin: long GRBs occur with the death of massive stars, while short GRBs have been proven to be the electromagnetic counterparts of the gravitational wave (originated due to the merger of two compact objects) signals discovered recently by LIGO/Virgo.
GRBs are believed to originate from a “jet” moving at a relativistic speed, launched by a fast rotating stellar-mass black hole or magnetized neutron star formed at the core collapse of a massive star (long GRBs, duration &amp;gt; 2 sec) or in the merger of compact objects (short GRBs, duration &amp;lt; 2 sec). The ejected out-flowing can have various shells that can collide with each other creating internal shock, which is responsible for the prompt gamma-ray emission. Later on, this material expands and interacts with the pre-existing material surrounding the GRB events (external shock), producing the broadband synchrotron radiation, which attributes to the afterglow emission (see Fig. 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after the GRB-prompt discovery, ground-based multi-wavelength observational facilities (including ARIES telescopes in the optical/NIR bands) started searching for the associated afterglows across the electromagnetic spectrum. Specifically, optical observations play a crucial role in constraining the redshift, energetics, environments, and geometry of these powerful astronomical sources. The longitudinal advantage of the Devasthal observatory (which lies in between the Canary Islands and Eastern Australia) and deep imaging/spectroscopy capabilities of back-end instruments (at visible and near-infrared bands) of the 3.6m DOT telescope (see Fig. 2a) together provide a unique opportunity to perform deep and longer follow-up observations of the optical counterparts/ associated host galaxies of GRBs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the optical brightness, some of the optical afterglows of GRBs are defined as &lt;em&gt;Dark GRBs.&lt;/em&gt; In the case of dark GRBs, either optical afterglow is very faint or not detected even after a deep and long search using optical telescopes. In addition, a few rare optical afterglows are detected independently without any prior prompt emission detection from space-based gamma-ray satellites, known as &lt;em&gt;Orphan GRBs.&lt;/em&gt; This article highlights the recent discovery of dark (GRB 210205A) and orphan (AT2021any/ZTF21aaeyldq) afterglows of GRBs using 3.6m DOT+ 4K × 4K CCD Imager (see Fig. 2b).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of GRB 210205A, an X-ray afterglow was discovered using Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT). We performed the optical follow-up observations to search for the optical afterglow using the 3.6m DOT + 4K × 4K CCD Imager; however, we did not find any optical afterglow despite deep follow-up observations, supporting the dark nature of the burst. We investigated the possible reason for the optical darkness. We found that either intrinsic faintness of the source or high redshift origin was a possible reason for the optical darkness of the afterglow of GRB 210205A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For AT2021any, no gamma-ray prompt emission counterpart was reported by any space-based satellites, and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF, a survey telescope)  independently discovered this source. We also detected this object using 3.6m DOT + 4K × 4K CCD Imager (see Fig. 2b) and found that it is the third known orphan afterglow with a measured redshift. The detection of orphan afterglows can be explained by one of the scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the source is observed on-axis (viewed along the line of sight to the observer on the Earth), similar to typical GRBs, however, the prompt emission of GRBs (the initial gamma-ray counterpart) was unambiguously missed by space-based gamma-ray telescopes, either due to their limiting sensitivity or source was not in their field of view.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suppose the source is observed off-axis (viewed outside the line of sight to the observer on the Earth). In that case, the emitted flux from the prompt emission decreases very sharply outside the opening of the jet because of the relativistic beaming of photons (when photons are moving with ultra-relativistic speed emit radiation in a beam in the direction of motion). Such faint prompt emission will be very hard to detect by GRB satellites. Later on, as the jet decelerates (due to external shock), the relativistic beaming becomes less intense, and the emission from the jet becomes detectable to observers at larger viewing angles (off-axis). We only detect the afterglow emission without any prior detection of the prompt gamma-ray emission (see Fig. 3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of  AT2021any, we performed a detailed broadband afterglow modelling (see Fig. 4a) and confirmed that AT2021any is observed on-axis (see Fig. 4b), and a gamma-ray counterpart was missed by GRBs satellites. We expect to detect more similar sources in the current era of survey telescopes with large fields of view like ZTF and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our results emphasize that the 3.6m DOT has a unique capability for deep follow-up observations of similar and other new transients for deeper observations as a part of time-domain astronomy in the future. GRBs are multiwavelength phenomena. Therefore, along with optical/near-infrared observations using 3.6m DOT, the follow-up observations at other wavelengths using Indian facilities, such as at radio wavelength using Giant Meter Radio Telescope (GMRT) and at UV/X-ray by Indian Space Observatory (AstroSat), may provide a comprehensive picture of these sources.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Evolution of plasma parameters during B class flares</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this article, we presented the temporal evolution of elemental abundances during solar flares of GOES B1−B4 class, the weakest events for which such studies have been possible so far, using observations with XSM on board Chandrayaan-2. This study was possible due to the extremely quiet solar conditions currently prevailing along with the availability of appropriate instrumentation. By modeling the soft X-ray spectra obtained with the XSM during different phases of these flares, measurements of temperature, emission measure, and abundances of Mg, Al, Si, and S were obtained. We have shown that the abundances of these elements are nearly photospheric during the peak phase, compared to their 3–4 times higher preflare values. Beyond the flare peak, the abundances are seen to get enriched again and they recover back to the coronal values at the end of the flare. This suggests that during the flares, the coronal loops are quickly filled with plasma originating from the lower parts of the solar atmosphere without having sufficient time for the usually observed fractionation in nonflaring loops to take place. Our observation of the quick recovery to the coronal values shows that any process giving rise to such fraction must be occurring on a timescale of a few tens of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sun’s atmosphere is made up of several layers, primarily the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the corona. The lowest layer is the Photosphere. The temperature of the photosphere is around 5500 degrees, whereas the temperature increases towards the outer layer of the atmosphere and exceed a million degrees at the outermost layer, the corona. The physical mechanism of heating the solar corona to such a high temperature has been a mystery for the last several decades. The current understanding suggests that the magnetic field associated with the Sun is responsible for such high temperatures at corona. The Sun’s magnetic fields are highly dynamic in space and time. Many regions on the Sun are found to have enhanced and concentrated magnetic fields, which are generally known as Active Regions (AR) at the corona. Occasionally sudden bursts of energy are found to release from the AR, known as solar flares. Though solar flares are very commonly seen within the AR, they are also found to occur outside the AR with a small amount of energy release. The modern &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spaceweather.com/glossary/flareclasses.html&quot;&gt;classification&lt;/a&gt; system for solar flares uses the letters A, B, C, M, or X, according to the peak flux in watts per square meter (W/m2) of soft X-rays with wavelengths 1 to 8 Angstrom, as measured at the Earth. The figure below shows the different types of solar flares observed by the geosynchronous equatorial satellites (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/goes-x-ray-flux&quot;&gt;GOES&lt;/a&gt;). X-class flares are the biggest flares seen in the solar atmosphere with a peak flux of &amp;gt; 10-4 W/m2, whereas the M, C, B, and, A-class flares are smaller and smaller flares having peak fluxes 10-5-10-4  W/m2, 10-6-10-5  W/m2, 10-7-10-6  W/m2, and &amp;lt; 10-7 W/m2 respectively (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the high temperature, the elements (H, He, Fe, O, Ni, Mg, Si, etc) present in the solar atmosphere are found to be ionized to their different ionization levels at different atmospheric layers depending on the temperature. As the origin of the plasma remains the same throughout the solar atmosphere, it is expected that the relative composition or so-called abundances of these elements remains the same throughout the solar atmosphere. However, the observational studies showed that the abundances of certain elements whose ‘First Ionization Potential’ (FIP; which is the minimum energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from a neutral atom) is lower than 10eV are 2-4 times more abundant in the AR than their photospheric values. This phenomenon is known as the FIP effect. Figure 2 represents a pictorial view of the FIP effect. The x-axis represents the first ionization potential of the elements, whereas the y-axis represents the elements’ abundance ratio (called FIP bias) at the corona and photosphere. All the elements (e.g., Na, Fe, Ni, etc.) with a first ionization potential less than 10 eV have FIP-bias of 2-4, representing they are 2-4 times more in the amount present in the corona than in the photosphere. The FIP bias for the elements having first-ionization-potential more than 10 eV (e.g., Ar, Ne, etc.)  are close to one representing their composition in both photosphere and corona remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the true origin of the FIP effect is not well known, the present understanding of the FIP effect is based on the upward reflection of the magnetic waves, known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfvén_wave&quot;&gt;Alfvén wave&lt;/a&gt;, at the top of the chromospheric layer.
The cartoon below (Figure 3) represents the process briefly. Here we considered a magnetic-field loop rooted in the lower atmosphere and expanded to the corona. The red arrow represents the increase of temperature with a height from the lower atmosphere. Due to the perturbation of the magnetic fields, Alfvén waves will be present inside the loop and can travel throughout it (as shown by the black arrows inside the loop). As the waves travel from upward to downward, they can reflect from the top of the chromosphere (as shown by the black arrows).  Due to the reflection of the waves, an upward force known as “Ponderomotive force” is experienced by the ions (as indicated by the magenta arrow) present in that layer (see Laming (2015)  for details). The ions influenced by the Ponderomotive force travel to the corona and increase their concentration to the corona. The temperature and pressure at the top of the chromosphere are such that only the elements having FIP less than 10 eV can ionize, whereas the high FIP elements remain neutrals, resulting in only the ions of low FIP elements present at the top of the chromosphere to be influenced by the Ponderomotive force, thereby increasing their concentration in the corona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus the present understanding of the FIP effect is based on the reflection of the  Alfven waves generated due to the perturbation of the magnetic field lines. These Alfven waves are related to the mechanism that heats the solar corona. Recently, it has been believed that the FIP effect is the bi-product of the coronal heating mechanism. Thus measuring the abundances and hence the FIP bias can be a tracer to understanding the origin of the FIP effect as well as the coronal heating mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FIP effect has been studied extensively in quiescent AR closed-loops and during the peak of big solar flares. During the peak of the big flares, a low FIP bias has been found compared with the closed-loop ARs.  However, the detailed picture of the FIP effect during the flare is not clear as the time evolution study of elemental abundances during the solar flare was limited due to technical limitations of the present generation instrument (e.g., sensitivity: lowest flux that an instrument can detect, instrument’s energy resolution: the capability of an instrument to distinguish the emission lines present at nearby energies, cadence: time gap between two successive observations, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, the elements’ absolute (i.e.,  relative to the H) abundances are measured using the spectroscopic technique. A recent instrument, Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM) onboard the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft, provides the spectrum of the Sun every second in the broad energy range of 1-15 keV. Its good spectral resolution and sensitivity have been useful for time-resolved spectroscopy. In time-resolved spectroscopy, the instrument provides the spectrum of the detected photons at each time step, and then analyzing each spectrum corresponding to a time step, we extract the characteristics of the incident photons on the detector. One can study the abundance evolution during solar flares using such a technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the period from 2019 September to 2020 May, covering the minimum of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle&quot;&gt;Solar Cycle&lt;/a&gt; 24, XSM observed nine B-class flares ranging from B1.3 to B4.5. The observed XSM light curve (blue color) for one of the flares is shown in Figure 4a. Light curves of the same flare as observed by the other instruments (non-spectroscopic) are also shown by gray and brown colors. For the time-resolved spectroscopy, we used the XSM observed spectra at different time intervals throughout the flares, as shown by the green and orange shaded background colors. Representative XSM spectra for three different durations as marked by the “1”, “2”, and “3” are shown in Figure 4b. All the line complexes observed in the XSM spectra are annotated in the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the spectrum of each of the shaded duration as marked by green and orange color in Figure 4a, we estimate the temperature, emission measure (EM; which is a quantity to quantify how much emission is coming from the source at a particular temperature), and absolute elemental abundances of four elements–Mg, Al, Si, and S throughout the flares. These are the first measurements of abundances during such small flares, and this study offers a unique insight into the evolution of abundances as the flares evolve. The results are shown in Figure 5. The flare light curve is plotted in a grey curve. Panels ‘a’ and ‘b’ (black and red color represent the results obtained from two different methods of spectral analysis; for detail, see the reference paper) show the evolution of the temperature and EM during the flare. In the impulsive phase of the flares, due to the sudden release of the energy, both temperature and EM increase as flares evolve. After the peak of the flare, the flaring plasma starts to cool down and reach the background plasma temperature at the end of the flare, as shown by the blue horizontal line.  The abundances of the Magnesium (black and red points in panels c) decrease toward their photospheric values (shown by the green horizontal band) during the impulsive phase of the flares. During the decay phase, the abundances are observed to quickly return to their pre-flare coronal values (shown by colored horizontal dashed lines as reported by several authors). A similar evolution of the abundances of other elements (Al, Si, and S) are also observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decay of the abundances (or FIP bias) during the impulsive phase of the flares can be explained by invoking the process of chromospheric evaporation, the process in which the photospheric materials come up to the corona. However, the quick recovery (in a few minutes time scale)  of the abundances from near photospheric to coronal values in the decay phase of the flare can not be explained by the present theory of the FIP effect alone, where to develop the FIP bias a time scale of 1-2 days is required. There are two possible scenarios that can explain our observation, as described in Figure 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first scenario, Figure-6; (1a) Impulsive phase–After the flare onset (at time t0), heat energy travels down to the chromosphere and evaporates the plasma there. The process of evaporating the plasma from the chromosphere is called chromospheric evaporation. The temperature peak is identified at the start (time t1) of the chromospheric evaporation. During the initial phase, plasma evaporates with high velocity and quickly passes through the fractionation layer (top of the chromosphere, where the reflection of the downward propagating Alfvén waves occurs and the ions are separated due to the Ponderomotive force) without getting fractionated, resulting in depletion of the coronal FIP bias. The EM peak is achieved (time t2 ) once the loop gets filled with the chromospheric plasma. At around the same time, the abundances of the low-FIP elements also attain their minima. (1b) Decay phase–The speed of the evaporative up-flow slows down significantly, allowing plasma enough time in the fractionation layer to get fractionated. The fractionated plasma eventually fills the coronal part of the loop, thereby demonstrating the recovery of the coronal FIP bias. (1c) Representative temperature, EM, and elemental abundance evolution curves. Time t4 marks the time of complete recovery of the coronal FIP bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second scenario, Figure-6; (2a), At the time of the flare onset (time t0 ), high amplitude Alfvén waves are initiated. The released heat energy gets transported to the chromosphere by suprathermal electrons (high energetic electrons), at speeds faster than those of the Alfvén waves. Evaporation starts at time t1 and reduces the coronal FIP bias. The temperature peak is observed around this time. (2b) The EM peak and abundance minima are achieved when the loop is filled with the evaporated plasma (t2). Once the flare-driven Alfvén waves arrive at the chromosphere (time t3 ), they rapidly fractionate the plasma. These Alfvén waves also carry significant heat from the flaring site to assist the evaporation. The fractionated plasma is then transported to the coronal part of the loop through evaporative upflows, which help in rapidly recovering the coronal FIP bias. (2c) Representative curves of temperature, EM, and elemental abundances for the second scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies during the peak of the big flares (X or M) found photospheric abundances, but how the abundances became photospheric was not very clear. A time-resolved spectroscopic observation with a good resolution was essential to study the problem in detail. Here using the recent X-ray spectrometer, XSM onboard Chandrayaan 2 orbiter, we did time-resolved spectroscopy during the B-class flares and showed the complete evolution of the abundances during the flares.  The results suggest that the coronal loops are quickly filled with plasma originating from the lower parts of the solar atmosphere during the flares. During the decay phase of the flares, the abundances reach their 3-4 times higher pre-flare values within a few tens of minutes. These results will help us to understand the origin of FIP bias during flares and provide constraints to develop the model of the FIP theory. This study suggests that measuring the abundances during the flares is an important tool to get insight into the flaring process. The B-class flares are much smaller than the large X or M-class flares. Thus it is expected that even smaller class flares could show a similar variation of the abundances during the flares. Studying smaller flares is of great interest in the entire solar physics community as it is believed that the smaller flares occur very frequently and heat the solar corona to million degrees. In follow-up work, we will study several much smaller A-class flares and compare the results with the present study.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>General Relativity And Its Effect On A Deformed And Misaligned Pulsar</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Observed pulsars are misaligned in nature. The misalignment scenario occurs when the rotation axis and the magnetic axis of the star forms a finite non-zero angle between them. This scenario gives rise to very interesting phenomenons. This article explores such a misaligned star which is oblate in nature due to the deformations of rotation would vary considering general relativistic corrections. Our calculations show some interesting features regarding the magnetic field, power loss and also the charge separation on the surface of such a star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neutron Stars (NSs) are very dense objects found in the universe, having masses ranging from about 1.4  MΘ ( MΘ  is the Solar mass) to about 2.2 MΘ . NS are the highly dense collapsed core of a a star of mass 8 MΘ  to 20 MΘ formed after a supernova explosion. The central density at the core of the NS is about few times that of the nuclear saturation density. The predictions of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) state that at such high densities, nuclear matter won’t be the stable state and the quarks present inside the nucleons will get deconfined resulting in a stable quark matter. Until now, there are no earth-based experiments that can probe such densities nor any reliable theoretical calculation. Therefore the only laboratory to test the theory of deconfinement at high density is at the core of the NS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very fast spinning NSs are also known as pulsars. Observed pulsars have a dipolar magnetic field with its magnetic moment directed along an axis known as the magnetic axis. The pulsars rotate about an axis called the rotation axis. These two axes are not directed in the same direction (they have some finite angle between them), and such pulsars are known as misaligned pulsars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/general_relativity_pulsar_sagnik_images/vel2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image 1 here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
A schematic diagram of a misaligned pulsar. The cyan-coloured spherical object is the pulsar which rotates about the rotation axis (blue axis), and the magnetic moment is pointed along the magnetic axis (red axis). The charged particles move with a velocity (v) as shown in the figure. The black lines show the closed magnetic field lines of the star. Image courtesy: author. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our recent publication, we have tried to provide a realistic model for such a pulsar. For simplicity of calculations, people tend to assume the star is aligned (the magnetic axis and the rotation axis coincide). Still, in reality, the pulsars found in the universe are misaligned. We have also considered the deformation due to the star’s rotation about its axis to provide a more accurate model. Thus our star tends to form an oblate shape, which adds an extra challenge to our calculations since we cannot assume the star to be spherically symmetric, which would have simplified our calculations. The general theory of relativity, given by Einstein in 1915, shows that heavy objects tend to curve the space-time. Since NSs are more massive than our sun, we need to consider these general relativistic effects to have the most accurate model possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work done by me, along with my supervisor Dr.Ritam Mallick, and my collaborator Dr.Debojoti Kuzur, shows some interesting results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our calculations show that along the star’s equator, the strength of the magnetic field reduces with an increase in the misalignment of the star. As there are no direct means to measure the misalignment angle, our calculations conclude that a pulsar which has lesser magnetic field near the equatorial plane compared to another pulsar having a higher magnetic field near the equator can be said to be more misaligned than the later. The pulsar will also lose its energy due to its rotation. We also studied how the general relativistic calculations differ from the known Newtonian approach of finding the power loss of the star. We see that with an increase in the misalignment angle of the star, the power loss increases, to a certain angle, after which it takes a sharp dip and rises again. As the star rotates about its axis with extremely high angular velocity, the charges near the star’s surface would separate as a result. This would result in the accumulation of the negatively charged particles called electrons near the poles of the star-forming dome kind of shape, and the positrons will accumulate near the equator of the star, forming a torus. The charge density near the star’s surface for such a scenario is called the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1969ApJ...157..869G/abstract&quot;&gt; Goldreich-Julian &lt;/a&gt; charge density of the star. We also calculated the Goldreich-Julian charged density for our model and compared it with the known model for the Newtonian case. Our results report changes from the known nature of the charge density distribution from the previous values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/general_relativity_pulsar_sagnik_images/GW_Newt.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image 1 here&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/general_relativity_pulsar_sagnik_images/freq_557_new4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image 1 here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

 &lt;b&gt; Top: &lt;/b&gt; Figure shows the comparison of the Goldreich-Julian density for the Newtonian and the general relativistic case, the x-axis denotes the polar angle &amp;theta; and the y-axis denotes the charge density in cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. As we increase the angle &amp;theta;, i.e. we move from the star&apos;s pole towards the star&apos;s equator, we see a change in the sign of the charge densities. At the pole of the star, we see more electrons (negative charges), and as we move towards the equator, we see more positrons (positive charges).	&lt;b&gt; Bottom:&lt;/b&gt; The plot shows the comparison of the power loss for the deformed pulsar for different values of misalignment angle &amp;chi;. The yellow line shows the results obtained from the general relativistic plot. The green coloured line shows the power loss for known Newtonian methods.

        <title>The International Moon Day</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On account of International Moon Day, we present a brief overview of the formation scenarios of the Moon. We also discuss the findings of Chandrayaan.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thats-one-small-step-for-man-one-giant-leap-for-mankind&quot;&gt;“That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the famous quote by Neil Armstrong during the live broadcast when he stepped on the Moon for the first time on 20 July 1969. The Apollo-11 mission was regarded as the biggest technological achievement by NASA. Armstrong and Aldrin had spent around 21 hours at a location known as Tranquility Base on the lunar surface collecting lunar samples. After spending more than eight days in space, the group returned to the planet and touched down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24. To celebrate this great feat, the United Nations marked the 20th July of every year to be celebrated as “International Lunar Day” in its resolution 76/76 on ‘International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space’ in 2021. To mark this day, in this article, we provide the current understanding of the formation of the most familiar astronomical object we see in the sky, the Moon and the Indian lunar missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moon has been an important part of the history of mankind, be it popular literature, religion or navigation. Scientific observations of the Moon date back to the 1600s, when Galileo Galilei turned his telescope towards the Moon to reveal its surface. Contrary to the popular belief that the Moon has a smooth surface, a topology abundant with craters and mountains was received with great surprise. Since then, we have had many scientific ventures to understand the Moon in great detail. Luna-2, by the Soviet Union, was the first spacecraft to reach the Moon and Apollo-11 by the United States made the Moon the first astronomical object other than Earth, where mankind had set foot on. Many studies have revealed important aspects of the Moon. Among all that, the most interesting question is about the origin of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Darwin, in 1879, put forward a hypothesis about the formation of the Moon. He proposed that the Moon was formed from a piece of mass that spun off from a rapidly rotating Earth in its molten phase during planet formation. This hypothesis is called the fission hypothesis (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, the capture hypothesis (Figure 2)  suggested the possibility of capturing of the Moon during a close flyby in Earth’s gravity field. In this scenario, the Moon was believed to be formed elsewhere in the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/ashish_international_moon_day/ashish_fig2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A co-accretion model (Figure 3) was suggested alternative to both the stated hypotheses. This model predicted that the Moon and Earth formed at the same location around the sun by accreting the same material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/ashish_international_moon_day/ashish_fig3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, these hypotheses started to break when we started understanding the Moon’s composition and bulk nature after the Apollo missions. The composition of the samples returned by the Apollo astronauts showed that Earth and Moon shared the same isotopic composition. And it was also seen that the Moon’s bulk iron content was less than Earth’s. The three stated hypotheses explaining the Moon’s formation could not explain these results. This led to a new hypothesis called the Giant Impact Hypothesis (Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/ashish_international_moon_day/ashish_fig4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1975, William K. Hartmann and Donald R. Davis proposed the Giant Impact Hypothesis. It explained that 4.5 billion years ago, after the Earth was formed and solidified to have a solid crust, it underwent a collision course with a Mars-sized planetesimal object which co-evolved in the neighbourhood of Earth. This impact caused rocks and debris to be collected in orbit around the Earth, and eventually, it accreted to form the Moon. This hypothesis could explain the same isotopic composition of Earth and Moon since both were created from the same material. By the time Earth had formed its solid crust (when the giant impact had happened), the heavier iron element in its composition had sunk to form an iron core of Earth. Hence, the material that was ejected from Earth’s crust and mantle as a result of impact was iron deficient. This explains the iron-poor nature of the Moon. As this impact theory can explain many known facts about the Moon, the Giant Impact hypothesis has been the long-standing theory that explains the origin of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the global abundance of various elements and minerals on the Lunar surface will help us to validate and model the Giant Impact hypothesis. India’s moon orbiting satellite, Chandrayaan missions has significantly contributed to this direction. Chandrayaan-1 was India’s first mission to the Moon. Moon mineralogy mapper (MMM, also known as M-cube), a payload onboard Chandrayaan-1, detected the trace of water at the poles of the Moon. Another payload, C1XS (Chandrayaan-1 X-ray Spectrometer), could detect major rock-forming elements on the surface and reported the first measurement of enhanced sodium on the lunar surface. Due to the short lifespan of nine months of Chandrayaan-1 around the Moon, a global elemental map remained unachieved until India launched Chandrayaan-2 in 2019. Chandrayaan -2 was an ambitious mission that carried a lander, rover and an orbiter. The Vikram lander was designed to soft-land on the lunar surface, and the rover named Pragyan was made to traverse the lunar surface performing experiments on the surface. But unfortunately, both Vikram and Pragyan hard landed on the Moon, making them unusable. The Orbiter, which carried eight scientific payloads, orbits the Moon giving valuable scientific data since 2019. A global elemental map of various elements is awaited as a major result of Chandrayaan-2. This vital data can shed clues to validate the existing hypothesis for the formation of the Moon. These studies will help us make the biggest leap to understanding the formation scenario of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Clouds’ Motion entangled by Magnetic Fields in Cepheus Flare</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Stars take birth in molecular clouds. The presence of magnetic fields everywhere in the universe naturally creates a curiosity to investigate their role at all the stages of star fomation. The motion of clouds through the interstellar medium in the presence of magnetic fields may get effected and can shed light on the structure/orientation of stellar nurseries.  This short article will explain these possible effects in an interesting region of our Universe, Cepheus Flare.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how stars are formed is one of the crucial questions in astronomy. Molecular clouds are the blank spaces or voids in between stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way and they consist of predominantly hydrogen or helium molecules. They are stellar nurseries in our local galaxy and the universe. The prestellar/protostellar cores are the high density nested quantities in large molecular clouds with a typical temperatures of 10 K and density of ~ 103 cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;. They are considered as the fundamental units for the formation of stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/cloud_motion_cepheus_flare_ekta/ekta_fig1.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnetic fields, which are ubiquitous to the universe, is a very interesting property. Due to their interaction with the ionized material, they can play an important role in the dynamics of the clouds. The angular offsets between the direction of the cloud motion and the magnetic fields, θ is shown in Fig. 1. These offsets can help in preventing the disruption of the cloud (radius Rc moving with velocity Vc) against the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the interstellar medium as suggested by simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stars which are young are still associated/embedded in the high-density clouds because the surrounding molecular material has not completely collapsed towards the centre. Their motion in the projected plane of the galaxy is defined as proper motion. Stars move in the interstellar medium (ISM) and their proper motion is a critical factor in determining their overall motion in the galaxy.  Proper motion can serve as a proxy of the motion of the clouds in the ISM. A team of researchers led by Dr. Ekta Sharma and Dr. Maheswar Gopinathan from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, an autonomous institute of the Department of Science &amp;amp; Technology, Govt. of India and Dr. Sami Dib from Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Denmark carried out an observational test on a sample of clouds (L1228, L1251, L1172/1174 and L1147/1158) located at a nearby distance of ~330 pc in Cepheus Flare region identified in Fig. 2. The Gaia (Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics) and Planck, both are space based observatories to study the motion of stars and the emission in far-infrared wavelengths, respectively. The authors used proper motion data from Gaia Data Release 3 to study the motion of the clouds in sky plane (shown by arrows in Fig. 2) and Planck polarization data to construct magnetic field maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They estimated various offsets between the direction of magnetic field and the motion of the clouds in the sky. The results show that the magnetic fields are ordered in all the clouds except one cloud, L1172/1174 which shows an offset (angle, θ in Fig. 1) higher than 30°. The authors suggest that the higher offset could be responsible for converting the cloud material in the form of hub-filament structure (see Fig. 3). These structures consist of a hub having less aspect ratio with high column density and a number of filaments with high aspect ratio with less column density.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starless cores are the earlier stages in the process of star formation which have not formed stars and the pretsellar cores are the ones which are on the verge of making stars. We made a quantitative analysis of the core orientations (direction of major axes) (in Fig. 4) with respect to the magnetic field in case of starless as well as the prestellar cores. The distribution for all the clouds is found to be random. The study concluded that the core dynamics could be affected more by the local variations in the magnetic field in the cloud’s environment. The results of this study have been published in the journal “Astronomy &amp;amp; Astrophysics”.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Understanding the emissions in Black hole binaries</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Yash Bhargava from Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, takes us through the journey of the death of a star in this wonderful article about his work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand what I do, I will have to take you on a journey of what happens after a star dies. Yes. Stars also die. Depending on its mass and composition, a star can die either by blooming into a red giant and then dispersing its external shell to leave a bright core at the centre, known as a White Dwarf, or by a gigantic explosion which can typically outshine a Galaxy - leaving either an extremely dense ball made almost entirely of Neutrons (also known as Neutron Stars) or an enigmatic Black hole at the centre. It becomes more interesting if the original star was already revolving around another star also known as the companion star. If the companion is close and large enough, the compact star (either White dwarf, Neutron star, or Black hole) is in a position to capture material from the companion.
When matter from the companion is captured in the gravitational well of the compact object, it doesn’t simply fall towards the compact object.  The matter would have an initial velocity which would force it to go into an orbit around the compact object. After a huge number of collisions, a fraction of matter would eventually form a disk around the compact object, something similar to the Rings of Saturn but with a tiny but very important twist. The matter in this disk is actually moving inwards while the particles in Saturn’s ring are orbiting the planet in a very stable manner. Hence these disks are called accretion disks. As the matter moves inwards closer to the compact object, it releases the gravitational potential energy. The closer the matter can get to the compact object, the more gravitational energy is available to be released. The conversion of the gravitational potential energy in the disk is a very efficient mechanism making these sources extremely bright. 
 The amount of energy being expelled is quite large, which raises the temperature of the matter so much that it emits radiation peaking in X-rays. Observing X-rays from ground-based observatories is impossible as the incoming radiation is blocked by the atmosphere. Thus scientists have sent many observatories to space to observe and study these enigmatic sources. One such observatory is AstroSat, which is India’s first multi-wavelength mission. It has 5 co-pointed instruments onboard to probe different properties of the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black hole Binaries are systems of binary stars in which the compact object is a Black hole. As compared to Neutron Star and White Dwarf, Black holes are more dense and compact, thus presenting a deeper gravitational potential well. Close to the Black hole, the extreme gravity, and relativistic effects dominate. Thus these systems are excellent laboratories to probe extreme conditions that are impossible to recreate on Earth. They also show very unique features which have not been completely understood to date. One of these features is a Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO), which is like an oscillation with many close-by frequencies occurring simultaneously. In contrast, many Neutron star binaries show pulsations that correspond to the rotation of the Neutron star and have only a single frequency, thus making them a great clock. The origin of QPO is quite uncertain as some observations indicate that it is a geometrical effect while others imply it is a resonance feature. Previous studies have indicated that the QPO might be related to precession in the accretion disk. But no single model can fully explain the properties of QPOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/blackhole_emission_yashb/image2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

The plot shows the power density spectrum, which is the square of the Fourier transform of the intensity variations with time (often called the light curve in the astronomical community). The QPO is highlighted as the grey shaded function. The features at harmonic frequencies (twice &amp;amp; half the QPO frequency) can also be seen.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of my research, I have studied different Black hole binary systems which have provided valuable insight into the dynamics of accretion disks. One of these systems, MAXI J1535-571 is quite intriguing. It was discovered in September 2017 and was one of the brightest objects in the X-ray sky when it went into an outburst. AstroSat stared at the source for 5 consecutive days and using the instruments on board we have a unique insight into the source. We have modeled the energy spectrum (which is a count of how many photons of different energies are we seeing) of the source using the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) and the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC), which tells us that this source has a high-temperature accretion disk and a cloud of electron which intercepts some of the energy from the disk and then scatters it to higher energies. The cloud of the electrons can be characterized by the slope of the high-energy spectrum seen by LAXPC. We find that during the observation, this slope is not constant and fluctuates about a mean value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/blackhole_emission_yashb/image3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 3: The X-ray spectrum of MAXI J1535-571. The emission from this source can be characterized by the multi-temperature accretion disk and Compton up-scattering of the accretion disk photons by a thermal cloud of electrons. The total emission was absorbed by neutral Hydrogen close to the source before reaching us. The emission from the Compton up-scattering of the photons depends on the electron temperature and the optical depth and manifests itself as the slope of the spectrum.
)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAXPC is a high time resolution instrument and allows us to measure when a photon strikes the detector with an accuracy of 10 microseconds. Thus we can determine if there are any fast oscillations occurring in the source. In this particular case, we see a very prominent QPO which also changes its frequency about a mean value as the observation progresses. We also measure the total output of the source which is dependent on the total accretion rate of the system and we find that it is increasing as time progresses. Models of QPO predict that, typically, the peak frequency of a QPO is linked with the accretion rate; as the accretion rate increases, the QPO frequency also increases. We find that for this source this is not the case for at least the duration of our observation. We see a very strong correlation between the variation in the QPO frequency and the spectral slope indicating that the origin of the QPO is tightly linked with the component responsible for shaping the spectrum. Whenever the QPO frequency increases the slope increases and when one decreases the other is also seen to decrease. These results led us to conclude that the QPO is closely tied to the cloud of electrons instead of the accretion disk where the previous theories expect it to arise from. This work questions the existing models of QPOs and accretion and demands the revision of long-held ideas.
This work and observations like this provide us with a window into a tiny region, extremely close to a Black hole that cannot be yet imaged with the current technologies. Only recently, scientists were able to combine the observations from radio telescopes across the world to create the first picture of a much larger black hole at the centre of the galaxy. But to understand the environment around a black hole in a binary system, indirect measurements (like the work described here) using the spectral and timing properties of the source will remain the primary method of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Anyway the plasma moves - it does really matter!</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Light when seen correctly provides rich information on what happens in the cosmos. In this article, we showcase our work on identifying signatures of the solar wind in the solar chromosphere – far lower in the solar atmosphere than what has been expected. We take the reader through our analysis, interpretations and speculations on our observations, and present a unified model of solar wind emergence and the heating of quiet corona.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: This article is a follow-up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmicvarta.in/solar-chromosphere-spectral-lines-vishal&quot;&gt;“Understanding the solar chromosphere through spectral lines”&lt;/a&gt; (which I shall henceforth call #A1) written by yours truly. While I have presented a summary of the previous article here too, possibly you would enjoy reading them together better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light, as we have seen in #A1, encodes in it information regarding the world. It is especially of great help to astronomers in figuring out what-where-why something happens. For those of us folks who study the Sun, we are bathed – or rather, burnt crisp with light. And so, light or photons carry with them information regarding various aspects of different regions on the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we have seen in #A1 that each element, or ion has a characteristic fingerprint in the form of “spectral lines”. The properties of these spectral lines depend on the plasma properties where the particular ion is present. Critically, it depends on the local temperature, density, velocity, and any other turbulent flows present in the plasma. These show up as effects on the line intensity, the line “shift” and the line width. And so by “reading out” these spectral lines, we can get an estimate of how much plasma is present, how fast it is moving, and in what direction it is moving – at the very least!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solar atmosphere is composed of the photosphere (at ~5500 K), the chromosphere (at ~10,000 to 80,000 K), Transition region (TR; ~1,00,000 K) and the corona (&amp;gt;10,00,000 K). The rise in temperature with height of the atmosphere is the rather much debated “Coronal heating problem”, which presents more questions than answers&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The corona then extends outwards as the streaming solar wind, with plasma moving at great speeds outwards from the Sun&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The exact reason(s) behind the large temperature of the corona, and the height (or the layer of the atmosphere) from where the solar wind starts are not known well, and are an unsolved problem in solar physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In #A1, we attempted to understand the underlying cause of these two problems in tandem by studying two regions called the Coronal Holes (CHs) and Quiet Sun (QS). The CHs are regions seen as dark in the corona against the background QS - see Fig. 1, first panel. However, if we go down to the TR (see Si IV in the same figure), or chromosphere (CII or Mg II k3), these differences vanish! Since the CHs are well known sources of the solar wind, studying these two regions together, and investigating where (and how) this differentiation starts can give us hints on resolving the coronal heating and solar wind emergence problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/vishal4_plasma_moves/image1_plasma_moves_vishal.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Fig. 1: Fig. 1: CHs (dark) and QS (bright) in the corona (AIA 193 Å), TR (Si IV) and the chromosphere (C II, Mg II k3) with the two regions demarcated by light green contours. 
Image source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11668 &quot;&gt;Vishal.U et al., 2022 &lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In #A1, we had studied the C II 1334 Å line - which forms in the upper chromosphere - in CHs and QS as a function of the underlying magnetic field. The general idea was to check if and how these two regions are differentiated depending on the underlying magnetic field. Our results in #A1 told us that QS is brighter than CHs only if we account for the underlying magnetic field. Similarly, we also found that plasma is both preferentially moving towards, and moving away from us (of course at different places!) in CHs, when compared to QS. This motion (and so the velocity) was found to be larger for regions with stronger magnetic fields! Such a result is counterintuitive – the CHs are known to be the source of the wind which travels towards us. Then why do we see the plasma strongly moving away from us? With this backdrop, let us dive into what other ions in the solar atmosphere tell us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us proceed systematically here - we are seeing some “anomalous” results in the C II 1334 Å line: a line that forms in the upper chromosphere. A simple way forward would hence be to check the properties of other lines which form in the same region of the chromosphere. And so, we performed the same analysis on what are called Mg II h and Mg II k lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mg II - Magnesium - is an awesome atom from which one electron has been removed. The transitions of this atom give rise to what are commonly called the h and k lines. Why do I call it awesome? Because the Mg II h &amp;amp; k lines are very complex – so complex that in fact they can give us the velocity of almost the whole of the chromosphere! If our results in the C II 1334 Å line were correct, they must be seen in what is called the ‘k3’ part of the Mg II line3. However, we also need to have a comparison against some “expected” results. For this, we performed the same analysis on the Si IV 1393 Å line – this line forms in the TR, and so will give very different dynamics when compared to C II or Mg II. Let us look at the results below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/vishal4_plasma_moves/image2_plasma_moves_vishal.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Fig. 2: QS-CH differences as a function of magnetic field (|B|) in the TR and chromosphere. The intensity ratio is depicted in panel a and velocity differences in other panels. Panel b depicts the difference in average velocity, while panels c &amp;amp; d show for the blue- and red shifted pixels alone. 
Image source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11668 &quot;&gt;Vishal.U et al., 2022 &lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fig 2, I present all the results we find for Mg II k3 and contrast them with Si IV. The way I present it is as follows: for the intensity, we are only interested in the “factor” by which the intensities are different, while for the velocities we are interested in the differences. The dashed lines depict the intensity ratio of 1/ velocity difference of 0 – i.e, case where no differences are seen. 
From Fig. 2a, the QS shows more intensity than CH - the factor is more than 1. This ratio is larger in Si IV (TR) than in Mg II k3 (chromosphere). This result is consistent with what we expect from physics – as we keep moving above in height, we will keep seeing QS becoming brighter than CH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fig. 2b, we check what the average velocity looks like. In the chromosphere the average CH-QS velocities are similar, while in TR the CH is less redshifted. Hence, we clearly see that the solar wind signature is starting to be seen in TR, but apparently not in the chromosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fig. 2c, we consider only those regions where plasma is moving towards us. Clearly, we see that the CHs have plasma moving much faster towards us than QS. The difference in velocities is also larger in the TR. This is in-line with our expectation of plasma moving towards us in CHs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally in Fig. 2d, we consider only those regions where the plasma is moving away from us. Here we see that while the QS plasma is falling down faster in the TR, the case is reversed in CHs! In-line with what we found from C II in #A1, Mg II k3 also tells us that the plasma is preferentially going away from us in CH at the chromosphere&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;! So this analysis tells us that the result we are seeing is something truly physical&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why could this be happening? Is there an “extra” push for the plasma to flow away from us in the CH, or is the plasma being stopped for some reason in the QS? And where are these flows coming from/going to? A clear dichotomy seems to occur between the chromosphere and TR – something is clearly happening at the interface of these two regions. And so to understand further, we study how the TR velocities change with chromospheric velocities. For instance, if a pixel shows upflow in Mg II k&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, what kind of flows does it show in Si IV? And how do these vary between CH and QS? This is a question we ask for multiple spectral lines, but I will just present the results for the Mg II k3 and Si IV below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/vishal4_plasma_moves/image3_plasma_moves_vishal.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Fig. 3: TR and chromospheric flow correlations in CHs (black) and QS (orange). Note that up-flows are blueshifts, and downflows are redshifts. 
Taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11668&quot;&gt;Vishal.U et al., 2022&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fig. 3a, we show downflows (=plasma moving away from us) in TR are related to downflows in the chromosphere. Turns out, the plasma that is moving away from us in TR is also seen moving away from us in the chromosphere, except that in QS the speed drastically reduces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we can look at how the upflows (=plasma moving towards us) in TR relate to the upflows in the chromosphere in Fig. 3b. Again, it turns out that the plasma that we see coming towards us in the chromosphere is getting accelerated towards us in TR. However, this time the CH plasma is accelerated more than QS! Next, we can also check if the plasma that is coming towards us the TR has any relation to the plasma that is moving away from us in the chromosphere. In Fig. 3c, interestingly, we find that faster the plasma in TR is coming towards us, faster is it also moving away from us in the chromosphere –with the upflows larger in CH. And finally, in Fig. 3d, it turns out that the plasma moving towards us in the chromosphere has not relation whatsoever with the plasma moving away from us in the TR. This is all very interesting, but what does it mean? 
It means that: (i). If a plasma parcel is moving towards us in the chromosphere, it would be accelerated even more in the TR. This seems like a signature of the solar wind coming towards us, but starting from the chromosphere – or maybe even lower! (ii). Plasma that is flowing down from the TR is decelerated as it falls down into the chromosphere, and this deceleration is much more in QS, and (iii). There seem to be flows coming out like “jets” both towards, and away from us – faster one end comes towards us, faster is the other end moving away from us! What is going on here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us handle each observation one by one, and then try to piece them together.First, why would plasma move? Plasma motion takes place if it is either forced to move due to pressure, or if the plasma is freely falling like a ball falls down once it’s thrown up. The freely falling case applies only to plasma that is falling down – for a plasma that is rising, we need something to pump pressure, like a piston. What could this mechanism be? A graphic summary is given in Fig. 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the solar atmosphere, it turns out there are complex mechanisms which can heat a small part of the plasma very quickly. Hot air rises, and similarly the plasma will be forced to rise. These complex mechanisms are generally “impulsive events”, for simplicity. These impulsive events are well known in the corona, and have been hypothesized to maintain the coronal temperature at a million degree Kelvin&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;! Hence, we may invoke a similar impulsive heat dumping mechanism throughout the solar atmosphere to get plasma moving!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the density in the solar atmosphere reduces drastically with height. If the amount of mass crossing a surface at a given time is kept constant, it can be shown that the velocity should increase with height (Fig. 4d). Thus, any upflows starting from the lower chromosphere due to these impulsive events will naturally accelerate, and can persist to great heights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, these impulsive events basically just dump some energy very quickly in the plasma. Since the plasma just needs to expand (and not only rise), the expansion can occur both ways – upwards and downwards! And if the energy were dumped between the chromosphere and TR, we will see plasma moving towards us in TR, and moving away from us in the chromosphere (Fig. 4a). These are called “bidirectional flows”. Thus, if more energy is dumped by the impulsive event, faster the plasma will move in both directions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let this event occur at a very great height – in the corona, for example. In such a case, we would only see the downward flowing plasma, since the upward flowing plasma would be seen in lines which form at much higher temperature. Hence this would be seen as persistent downflows (Fig. 4c)! However, note that the “freely-falling” plasma can also simply fall down,  and can give a similar signature (Fig. 4b).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how does this explain the difference between CH and QS? For this, we invoke something we kind of know from observations: How does the magnetic field approximately look like in CH and QS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fig. 5, open magnetic field lines (in black) are drawn near closed loops (in yellow) in CH, while closed loops alone are drawn in QS. When you have magnetic field lines close by, a phenomenon called magnetic reconnection can occur, which causes field lines to snap and rejoin. This will release a large amount of energy contained in the magnetic field in a very short period of time – these would be our impulsive events!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/vishal4_plasma_moves/image5_plasma_moves_vishal.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Fig. 5: A schematic depicting the proposed picture of impulsive heating occurring across different magnetic field topologies. In the left panel, we show a CH topology, including open funnel-like structure (black), closed loops of varying sizes (yellow), and impulsive events (red asterisks) due to interchange reconnection between the open and closed field lines, giving rise to bidirectional flows (blue and red arrows). The kinked field line propagating outward as a switchback is depicted as a dashed line, with the approximate propagation direction by black arrows. Right panel: QS topology shown with the same terminology as the left panel.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reconnection process itself just needs two magnetic field lines, preferably pointing in opposite directions. However, what happens to the plasma after reconnection depends on the overall shape of the field lines, which guide the motion of plasma. Hence, the resultant of reconnection will be different in CH and QS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the CHs we have “interchange reconnection” between the open field lines and closed loops. While this gives rise to the correlated motion, the plasma is preferentially guided away from the surface (and hence towards us as blueshifts) along the open field line. The open field eventually takes the plasma away, and puts it out into the solar wind. Since plasma is being taken away along the magnetic field, it doesn’t stay and emit enough light for us to see. However, depending on how predominant loops of different heights are, the signatures would be different. Hence, the solar wind may start from a range of heights, with something specific going on in the interface of chromosphere and TR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the QS, however, the reconnection is only between closed loops. In this case, while the correlated motion is present, the plasma is not allowed to escape into the solar wind, and is kept trapped inside the loop – this and the CH effect above give rise to the intensity ratio of Fig. 2a.! However, due to the presence of excess plasma at the bottom (remember, cool plasma can just gravitationally fall down towards the photosphere!) in QS, any downflows will be decelerated in QS. Thus, all our observations are naturally explained by invoking magnetic reconnection in what are called different magnetic topologies!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about the coronal heating problem? We have actually already described it – the reconnection mechanism! Energy dumping by reconnection is precisely the needed means to maintain the solar corona – however, this occurs across various heights in the atmosphere, but predominantly starting from the TR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one unexpected result from this scheme of things is the generation of what are known as switchbacks. In Fig. 5, the dashed field lines in the CH are how the magnetic field evolves after reconnection. Over the past couple of years, similar structures have been found in the solar wind, and called switchbacks. If the switchbacks form in the chromosphere/ TR, then the velocities that we provide will serve as constraints on the different models to test out the theory! Thus, in one neat sweep, we can potentially unify solar wind emergence, coronal heating, and switchback generation in a single mechanism!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this mean we have now solved all of these problems? No! On the contrary, we actually need to perform realistic (a subjective word!) simulations of the Sun to check the viability of various aspects of this model. For instance, we still need to understand some of the following questions: how much energy does a typical reconnection event release? How much of this energy is transformed to velocities of different ions? How much of this energy gets radiated away by the plasma? How many reconnection events typically occur in CHs and QS in the first place? Does all of the plasma eventually escape out into the solar wind? If so, do we find similar results while probing hotter (and cooler) spectral lines? These are some typical questions we are trying to answer in a future work!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SARAS 3 telescope refutes astrophysical origins of the claimed cosmic dawn signal</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SARAS 3 experiment&lt;/strong&gt;, designed and developed at &lt;strong&gt;Raman Research Institute&lt;/strong&gt;, has conclusively refuted the claim of detection of the signal from &lt;strong&gt;cosmic dawn&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;EDGES experiment&lt;/strong&gt;. It has become the &lt;strong&gt;first experiment worldwide to reach the required sensitivity and cross-verify the claim&lt;/strong&gt;. Given the unusual nature of the claimed signal, several non-standard cosmological models were proposed. &lt;strong&gt;SARAS 3 findings do not support these exotic models proposed previously. The results are now published in Nature Astronomy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first light in the Universe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observations of the cosmic microwave background have transformed our knowledge about the first atoms in the Universe. Similarly, we have a reasonable understanding of our local Universe through multi-wavelength observations conducted routinely via Earth and space-bound telescopes. However, there is a knowledge gap in understanding the transition of the Universe from being filled with hydrogen to the Universe as we know it today. The transition encompasses the very first stars and galaxies and ionization of the Universe through radiation emitted by them. This period, referred to as the cosmic dawn and epoch of reionization, poses several questions. These questions include the formation of the first stars in metal-free environments, heating and ionization of the Universe via radiation from these first stars, and timelines for various events in this period (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~loeb/sciam.pdf&quot;&gt;https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~loeb/sciam.pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the ways to answer these questions is to observe the cosmic dawn through radiation emitted by hydrogen atoms. Due to spin-flip transition, the hydrogen atom emits radiation at 21-cm wavelength (rest-frame frequency of 1420.4 MHz) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/web/Ch7.html#S8&quot;&gt;https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/web/Ch7.html#S8&lt;/a&gt;). The 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn is expected to arrive on Earth stretched in wavelength to meters and lowered in frequency by the expansion of the Universe to lie in the radio frequency band 50-200 MHz. Each frequency would provide a snapshot of the Universe at a given instant!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, detecting a signal from such an early period of the Universe is extremely difficult. The same frequency range is home to several terrestrial interference sources, including FM and TV stations, satellites, power line transmissions, etc. Even if one were to avoid all the terrestrial interference, our Galaxy emits radiation that is 100,000 times stronger than the strength of the signal! Another part of the challenge is that we do not know what the 21-cm signal looks like, unlike some other cosmological signals. While we have some broader ideas about its nature, its exact characteristics cannot be known owing to our poor understanding of the first stars. It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack while not knowing what the needle really looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such high precision measurements, the radio telescope must have high calibration accuracy to separate the contributions from the instrument, terrestrial interference, and the Galaxy to finally get down to the treasured 21-cm signal. Any small miscalibration of the telescope can lead to a false detection or limit us from reaching the sensitivity levels needed to detect the signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SARAS experiment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SARAS experiment at Raman Research Institute (RRI) is custom designed to detect the faint 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn. SARAS has been meticulously designed and calibrated to measure sky radiation to an accuracy of 0.0001%. Once built and tested, it is deployed in the remotest sites in India to observe the night skies in a minimum terrestrial interference environment. The observations span over a few weeks, followed by months of analysis, refinement of the design, and re-deployments for a fresh season of observations. Several surveys were conducted early on to find sites conducive to such experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDGES result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDGES is a radio telescope operating in Western Australia. It is led by astronomers at Arizona State University and MIT. The experiment claimed detection of the 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn in March 2018 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25792&quot;&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25792&lt;/a&gt;). This was the first discovery claim in the field of 21-cm cosmology and rightly created much excitement in the astronomy community worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the detection looked nothing like the theoretical predictions. The strength of the reported signal was at least twice compared to theoretical predictions. Therefore, the EDGES claim of detection led to several speculations about how the Universe might differ from current understanding. These speculations included exotic physics, non-standard cosmology, a new population of galaxies, and new models of dark matter that may have resulted in such an unusual signal. However, appreciating that in such difficult measurements, errors in instrument calibration might result in spurious deductions, cross verification of such a claim had become an urgent priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latest Deployment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third edition of the telescope, SARAS 3, was deployed on lakes with a focused goal to cross-verify the EDGES claim. This was the first instance ever for a radio telescope to observe on water. The reason for floating the telescope on the water is to provide a homogenous medium of high dielectric constant below the antenna. Such a medium enhances telescope performance and reduces confusing radio waves emitted by the very ground beneath radio telescopes. After an extensive search, two lakes in Karnataka, Dandiganahalli Lake and Sharavati backwaters, were selected for observations. The observations were carried out in January and March 2020, ending with a lockdown in Bangalore!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis and Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before one can start looking for the presence of the cosmological signature in the data, several corrections are required. These include calibrating the “bandpass response” of the telescope, rejecting the interference signals from terrestrial sources, accounting for the varying efficiency of the antenna over the observed frequency range, and subtracting off the contributions from the telescope and water. This process is followed by adopting a model that represents our knowledge about the emission from the Galaxy and any residual contributions left by the instrument. 
Once we have a model, we can ask whether the claimed cosmological signal exists in the processed data. By adopting several different methods of asking this question, SARAS 3 observations found no evidence of the signal via each of them. The signal was rejected at 95.3% confidence. Therefore, the finding implies that the detection reported by EDGES was plausible contamination from their instrument and not a signature from the early Universe. SARAS 3 was indeed the first experiment to reach the required sensitivity and cross-verify the claim of the signal detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, 21-cm signal from the early Universe continues to elude astronomers worldwide! Having rejected the EDGES claim, SARAS 3 team is planning more observations on remote lakes in India. At the same time, there is a strong motivation to find pristine sites with little to no interference. One of the best sites imaginable is the far side of the Moon! Effectively shielded from both the Sun and the Earth, it is one of the quietest sites in the solar system to conduct cosmological observations. Therefore, we are proposing a space-based payload, PRATUSH, that would orbit the Moon, conducting observations when in the far side 
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://wwws.rri.res.in/DISTORTION/pratush.html&quot;&gt;https://wwws.rri.res.in/DISTORTION/pratush.html&lt;/a&gt;). It is currently under study phase, supported by ISRO. Such expeditions will allow us to detect the 21-cm signal from the cosmic dawn and unravel this last remaining gap in the history of our Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
