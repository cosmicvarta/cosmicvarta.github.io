        <title>The First Theoretical Model of the Near-Surface Shear Layer of the Sun</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is well known that the Sun rotate differentially, i.e. its equator rotates faster than the pole. Not only at the surface, but the solar rotation profile also varies with the radius, which was discovered in helioseismic observation. This observation reveals an exciting feature close to the visible solar surface that the rotation profile of the Sun changes very sharply, which is named as Near-Surface Shear Layer (NSSL). In this work astronomers from ARIES and IISc have given the theoretical explanation for the existence of NSSL very the first time. They have used the thermal wind balance equation to explain the existence of NSSL.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sun, our life-giving star, has always been a star of many interests. Its importance for the living beings made many astronomers turn their telescope towards the Sun just after the advent of the telescope by Galileo Galilei. The early and regular observations of the Sun revealed the presence of dark spots, now known as sunspots, and 11 years of periodic variation in their number of appearances, popularly known as the solar cycle. The systematic observations of sunspots also show that the solar surface rotates &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_rotation&quot;&gt;differentially&lt;/a&gt;, which means the equator of the Sun spins faster than its pole. However, the internal rotation of the Sun has only been revealed after the &lt;a href=&quot;http://soi.stanford.edu/results/heliowhat.html&quot;&gt;helioseismology&lt;/a&gt; (technique of using sound waves to peek inside the Sun) era. Helioseismology has answered the many puzzling questions about the Sun while raising many questions about our nearest star at the same time. One of the crucial observations that helioseismology has made was the existence of the near-surface shear layer (NSSL).  The NSSL is the region very close to the visible solar surface, where there is a sharp change in the rotation profile of the Sun. The understanding of NSSL is crucial for the Sun, but it will also help us understand the other stars. Many researchers had indicated the presence of such a layer in the past based on solar surface observations but the real inference has been provided only after helioseismic measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in this work, researchers from ARIES, Nainital and IISc Bangalore have given the theoretical explanation for the existence of NSSL, for the very first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their study used the thermal wind balance equation, which tells about how the slight difference in temperature between solar poles and equator, which is called thermal wind term, is balanced by the centrifugal force appearing due to solar differential rotation. Now, the question is, why are they expecting the solar pole to have a slightly higher temperature? To understand this, we have to think about the motion of plasma blobs or convective blobs in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/interior.shtml&quot;&gt;solar convection zone&lt;/a&gt; in which heat is transported by convection in the same way as it is transported in boiling water. Unlike boiling water, the Sun is rotating, and hence the upward moving blobs will experience &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force&quot;&gt;Coriolis force&lt;/a&gt;. The effect of Coriolis force is zero on blobs moving along the axis of rotation (as in the case of a pole) and will be maximum when they are moving perpendicular to it (as in the case of the equator). Therefore, the heat transfer will be more efficient along the axis of rotation, leading to a higher temperature near the pole which drives the plasma from pole to equator. Another term is called centrifugal, which arises due to solar differential rotation driving the plasma in the opposite direction that is equator to pole. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/interior.shtml&quot;&gt;temperature profile of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; shows a sharp decrease near the visible surface and authors have shown that the pole-equator temperature difference also decreases as we approach the surface. To balance these effects Solar rotation profile (centrifugal term) has to change sharply, giving rise to NSSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most scientists believe that this condition is valid only in the interior of the Sun, and it does not hold near the solar surface. In their work, the authors have shown that this belief actually holds near the surface as well. They have noted that if this condition is true near the solar surface it can explain the existence of NSSL which is inferred in helioseismology based observation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Twinkle twinkle little stars, should I wonder what you are? A brief account of variable stars</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Curiosity is what has driven mankind to observations of new phenomena. Every twinkling star in the night sky is definitely not due to the atmospheric refraction of earth. Rather, one might be looking at a variable star, each with a different origin story to tell. A study of variable stars enhances our understanding of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-introduction&quot;&gt;1.	Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first nursery rhymes I might have been introduced to was the popular rhyme, “Twinkle twinkle little star”. Over the years, the verse took a different form once we were introduced to the astronomically correct idea of a star. Now the rhyme reads somewhat like below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;
Twinkle twinkle little star&lt;br /&gt;
You look small cause you are far&lt;br /&gt;
Lightyears out from here to there&lt;br /&gt;
Your light is distorted by the air&lt;br /&gt;
So you twinkle twinkle little star&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elementary physics lectures have introduced us to the idea of atmospheric refraction, due to which observed starlight seems to vary in intensity. This phenomenon of twinkling is attributed to the varying densities of the atmosphere. However, not all twinkling stars attribute their twinkle to atmospheric refraction. Some twinkle due to their inherent properties. Such stars are called variable stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time scales associated with stellar evolution are generally so large that the Universe has been traditionally viewed as a static phenomenon. However, we have long known short human time scale events, such as Solar System events and stellar explosions. With the advent of robotically controlled telescopes and high cadence near all-sky monitoring in the last decade of the 1990s, the study of astronomical events on ever shorter time scales has exploded. With access to this new stream of data, our understanding of many phenomena has increased significantly. However, the number of unanswered questions have increased multiple times. One such question addressed the dilemma of why many celestial bodies varied in their brightness. This led to the study in the field of Time-Domain Astronomy and variable stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-time-domain-astronomy&quot;&gt;2.	Time Domain Astronomy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time domain astrophysics is a field of observational astronomy that studies the universe on all timescales from less than milliseconds to more than decades and at all wavelengths. This became possible due to the availability of great detectors and computing advances over the past decades. The idea of observations and analysis have now moved beyond the one-off photographic surveys in the past. Beginning from the 1990s, the MACHO(massive astrophysical compact halo object), OGLE(Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment), and SuperWASP projects used large field of view, highly sensitive cameras on manual or robotic optical or near-infrared telescopes and obtained deep digital images of large swathes of the sky. These scans were repeated to build up vast databases of time-resolved images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were to describe the elementary ideas of time-domain astronomy, we could explain it in the following manner. Observe a particular section of the sky. Note the physical limits visible in that section. After some time t, observe the area under consideration. If any of the physical quantities have changed from earlier, we tag the particular body in the database for future study. The time it takes for the instrument to re-observe the same patch of sky is referred to as the “cadence.” The old strategy of looking deep and far into the Universe is used, and sources of a given brightness methodically mapped out in a three dimensional volume. In time-domain astronomy, sources that vary by some brightness with a rate equal to the inverse of the instrument cadence can be steadily mapped out. In a way, the time-domain adds another dimension, given by the frequency equal to the inverse cadence, to the properties of observed phenomena. The study of variable stars is an essential section of time-domain astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-variable-stars&quot;&gt;3.	Variable Stars&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omicron Ceti was the first variable star to be identified in 1596 by David Fabricius. Johannes Holwards observed Omicron Ceti pulsating in a regular 11-month cycle in 1638. This discovery debunked the theory that the stars were eternal and invariable as ancient philosophers such as Aristotle had believed.
Variable stars change in brightness over time. These changes can vary from as small as a few parts in a million or by a considerable factor. The changes observed can also range from a few milliseconds to a few years or decades, for that matter. Since many astronomical bodies can qualify as a “variable star”, an array of techniques are devised to discover and analyse the possibility of a variable star. The next obvious question is on the importance of studying variable stars. The study is of importance as the variations provide unique insights about nature, the origins, evolution and often the future trajectory of the star under observance. This information helps us deduce more fundamental knowledge about our universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variations may be due to the rotational motion executed by a spotted star, or due to a star being eclipsed by its companion star, or even by an unseen planet. The variations may also be due to the vibrations of a star. If these vibrations are complex, we might be able to get a rough picture of the internal structure and composition of this star. The variations may be due to eruptions on a star (flares), or an accretion disc (dwarf novae) or major explosions on a star (novae), or to the total disruption of a star in a supernova. Supernovae are one of the most violent incidents in the known universe. However, the existence of life is an indirect result of supernovae. They help to recycle the atoms created in stars into space. Some of these atoms became part of the Sun, others into planets, and for that matter, even the biosphere. It is deduced that the elements heavier than iron were mostly created in the supernova explosion. Supernovae may be dramatic and extreme, but they represent only one of the many roles that variable stars play in modern astrophysics and in our understanding of the universe and the processes which govern it. The organised study and recording of observations led to the establishment of the Variable Star Section of the British Astronomical Association (BAAVSS) in 1890, followed soon after by the establishment of variable star studies at Harvard College Observatory, which eventually led to the founding of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) in 1911.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-classification-of-variable-stars&quot;&gt;4.	Classification of Variable Stars&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The General Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS) recommends an official classification system of variable stars based on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Light Curve&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Temperature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Luminosity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Population type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this system, a family tree of variable stars can be constructed. Such a tree is called a Variability Tree. A simplified version of the variability tree is given below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/twinkle_twinkle_little_star_robin_thomas_images/Image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variable stars are classified into two groups based on the reason of variability in the observed intensities, Intrinsic and Extrinsic variable stars. They are further categorised into sub-classes, which are discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-intrinsic-variable-stars&quot;&gt;5.	Intrinsic Variable Stars&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic variable stars vary their light output, hence their brightness, due to the physical variation in the star or stellar system. This type of star provides a large amount of information about the internal structure of the star that helps astronomers to model the stellar evolution. Pulsating stars and eruptive or cataclysmic variable stars belong to this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;51-pulsating-variable-stars&quot;&gt;5.1.	Pulsating Variable Stars&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulsating variables are the stars that show periodic expansion and contraction of their surface layers. The change in brightness occurs due to the change in size or shape. Most of the pulsating stars simply expand and contract repeatedly in a continuing cycle of size changes and this is known as the fundamental mode of pulsation. Some of the changes not only in their size but also in their internal arrangement of material. Some others vibrate in more than one way at the same time and this makes the system complex. Like most vibrating systems, pulsating variables repeat their changes and they tend to be periodic. Depending on the period, on the mass and evolutionary status of the star, pulsating variables are classified into many categories. We shall discuss each sub-category briefly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;cepheid-variable-stars&quot;&gt;Cepheid variable stars&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cepheid variables form an important class of pulsating variables. These are large yellow stars pulsating with periods from 1 to 70 days, with an amplitude of light variation from 0.1 to 2 magnitudes. They are very bright objects and have periodic oscillations. Cepheid light curves are distinctive and show a rapid rise in brightness followed by a more gradual decline that is shaped like a shark fin. The spectral class of Cepheid actually changes as it pulsates, being about an F type at maximum luminosity and down to G or K at minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cepheids follow a period-luminosity relation. Period luminosity relationship states that ‘more luminous cepheids pulsated more slowly’. This concept was put forward by Henrietta Leavitt in 1912.
The period of cepheid can be calculated from its light curve which can be used to estimate the Cepheid’s luminosity. Knowing its magnitude and luminosity we can calculate the distance using the relation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;
m - M = 5 log(d/10)
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; is the apparent magnitude, &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; the absolute magnitude and &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; the distance to the star in parsecs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;long-period-variables&quot;&gt;Long-period variables&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the largest population of pulsating variables are the long-period variables (LPVS). They are pulsating red giants or supergiants with periods ranging from 30 to 1000 days. Long-period variables are further subdivided into two major subclasses, the Mira type and the semiregular variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;a-mira-variable&quot;&gt;a.	Mira variable&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are periodic red giant variables that vary with periods of 80 to 1000 days in magnitudes as high as 2.5 in the visible bands. Mira type variables are red giant stars, often of enormous size. Their high luminosity means that they can be detected at large distances. Many of them are slowly ejecting a steady stream of matter into the surrounding space and this mass loss has dramatic consequences on their future evolution. They have weak outer layers in their atmosphere which gets heated from regular pulsations. These are interesting due to their similar size as the Sun and that they are undergoing a late stage of the same evolutionary path that all one-solar mass stars, including the Sun, will experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;b-semi-regular-variable&quot;&gt;b.	Semi-regular variable&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semiregular variables are giants or supergiants which show appreciable periodicity accompanied by semiregular or irregular light variation. Their periods range from 30 to 1000 days, generally with amplitude variations of fewer than 2.5 magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;rr-lyrae&quot;&gt;RR Lyrae&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RR Lyrae stars are of short period (.05 to 1.2 days), pulsating white giant stars, usually of spectral class A. They are older and less massive than Cepheids. The amplitude of variation of RR Lyrae is generally from .3 to 2 magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;rv-tauri-star&quot;&gt;RV Tauri Star&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RV Tauri stars are yellow supergiants having a characteristic light variation with deep and shallow minima. Their periods, defined as the interval between two deep minima range from 30 to 150 days. They show brightness variations of up to 3 magnitudes. Some of these stars show long term cyclic variations from hundreds of thousands of days. Generally, their spectral class ranges from G to K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;52-cataclysmic-variable-stars&quot;&gt;5.2.	Cataclysmic variable stars&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eruptive variables are stars varying in brightness because of violent outbursts caused by thermonuclear processes in their surface layers. They exhibit significant and rapid changes in their luminosity which is usually accompanied by mass outflow in the form of stellar winds of variable intensity. These are a system of two stars (binary system) orbiting very close to each other. One of them is a normal sunlike or giant star, while the other is a white dwarf. Some of the outermost material from the larger star is pulled away by the white dwarf’s gravity, but this material does not fall directly onto the white dwarf. Instead, it builds up in a disk called an accretion disk, which orbits the white dwarf. Thus, the eruptive variable star is a combination of normal or giant stars, white dwarf and accretion disk as shown in the following figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/twinkle_twinkle_little_star_robin_thomas_images/Image4.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of main-sequence or giant stars, white dwarf and accretion disk lead to celestial fireworks. So, instead of varying like pulsating variables, eruptive variables exhibit outbursts of activity. Some events may result in the destruction of the star while others can reoccur one or more times. These are called recurrent novae. The changes in their light curves are usually very unpredictable and tend to be sudden and dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;53-supernovae&quot;&gt;5.3.	Supernovae&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supernovae are examples of such cataclysmic variable stars. These occur either during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion. The original object(progenitor) either collapses to a neutron star or black hole or gets destroyed. We will now look briefly into the types of supernovae.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;type-i-supernovae&quot;&gt;Type I supernovae&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These do not exhibit any hydrogen lines in spectra. Type Ia supernovae are understood to arise from white dwarf stars in a close binary system. As gas from the companion star accumulates on the white dwarf, the white dwarf is continuously undergoing compression. At the Chandrasekhar Limit, the white dwarf has accumulated too much mass to resist the force of gravity, thus setting off a runaway nuclear reaction inside. This leads to a cataclysmic supernova outburst. Type Ia supernovas are employed as “standard candles” to measure cosmic distances because they are believed to blaze with equal brightness at their peaks. Hence, they can be used as standard candles to determine the distance to a galaxy once the stretch factor is accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;type-ii-supernovae&quot;&gt;Type II supernovae&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pre-requisite for a star to explode as a Type II supernova is that the star must be several times more massive than the sun (around 8 to 10 Msolar). Once the core of this star runs out of hydrogen and then helium at its core, it moves ahead with the nucleosynthesis process to create heavier metals. As a result, heavier elements accumulate at the centre, similar to a layered onion. Lighter elements are found in the outer regions of the star. Once the star’s core becomes heavier than the Chandrasekhar limit, the star begins to implode. This is why these supernovae are called core-collapse supernovae. Eventually, the core starts to heat up and becomes denser. The implosion bounces back off the core and expels the stellar material into space, forming the supernova. Type II supernovae show hydrogen lines in their early spectra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-extrinsic-variable-stars&quot;&gt;6.	Extrinsic Variable Stars&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extrinsic variable stars are those in which the light output changes due to some process external to the star itself. The two main classes of extrinsic stars are the eclipsing binaries and rotating variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;61-eclipsing-binaries&quot;&gt;6.1.	Eclipsing binaries&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eclipsing binaries are binary star systems whose members eclipse each other, blocking one another’s light. As a result, the system looks occasionally fainter to observers on earth. The light curve of an eclipsing binary depends on the sizes and brightness of the stars, their separation from each other and the geometry of view from the earth. The process of eclipsing and the corresponding light curve of an eclipsing system is shown in the figure below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;62-rotating-star&quot;&gt;6.2.	Rotating star&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rotating variables are rapidly rotating stars, often in binary systems, that undergo small amplitude changes in light due to dark or bright spots on the star’s surface which is much similar to sunspots on the sun. Stars with sizeable sunspots show significant variations in brightness as they rotate. Stars that have ellipsoidal shapes also exhibit variation in brightness when they present varying areas of the surface to the observer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-conclusion&quot;&gt;7.	Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiosity is what has driven mankind to observations of new phenomena. Every twinkling star in the night sky is definitely not due to the atmospheric refraction of earth. Rather, one might be looking at a variable star, each with a different origin story to tell. A study of variable stars enhances our understanding of the universe. Cepheid variables help in determining distances to galaxies and determining the age of the Universe. Mira variables help us in making an understanding of the future evolution of the Sun. Accretion disks in cataclysmic variables help us to understand the activity inside active galaxies with supermassive black holes. Type Ia supernovae have helped us conclude on the accelerated expansion of the Universe by acting as a standardisable candle. Transiting extrasolar planets provide clues into the processes of planetary formation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The scientific legacy of Thanu Padmanabhan</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thanu Padmanabhan, fondly known as Paddy, was an internationally acclaimed Indian theoretical physicist, whose research works are spread across a variety of topics in gravitation, quantum theory and the study of our universe. Progress in theoretical physics happens in two different, but equally important, ways. The first corresponds to significant advances achieved using existing theoretical frameworks, while the second corresponds to, what may be called, `paradigm shifts’. Padmanabhan’s immense contributions to physics have been on both of these fronts. About 300 papers in refereed international journals, about 10 books and numerous other articles that he has authored, spread over about four decades of his monumental career, is a testimonial to the impact he made in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1977, a 20-year-old Padmanabhan started his research journey by investigating the interaction between gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves. The results of his mathematical study were published in the reputed journal `Pramana’, while he was still an undergraduate student at University College, Trivandrum. Little did his friends and colleagues know that this was only the start of a stellar career of one of the brightest and fastest thinkers of our time. We shall now briefly glance through some of his contributions in the decades that followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It should be mentioned that the following `summary’ does not faithfully cover all of Padmanabhan’s contributions. This article is only an attempt to explain, in simpler terms, a few of his works that have influenced the author the most. ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Quantum meets Gravity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics and the general theory of relativity are two of the foundational pillars on which theoretical physics, as we understand it today, is built. While quantum mechanics offers an efficient approach to understand physics at the smallest scales, general relativity furnishes the most satisfactory theory of gravitational interaction at our disposal today. Recall that according to our current understanding, there are four fundamental interactions in nature: the strong nuclear, the weak nuclear, the electromagnetic and the gravitational interactions [1]. A thorough understanding of the first three forces is essential to describe physics at the subatomic to the molecular level. On the other hand, while studying physics at these scales, theoretical physicists often ignore even the existence of gravity and get away with it quite safely! However, the effects of quantum mechanics are quite significant at these smallest scales. Hence, any sensible theory that attempts to describe phenomena at these levels must respect the principles of quantum mechanics. Fortunately, we have a remarkable model to describe the strong nuclear, weak nuclear and electromagnetic forces that incorporate quantum theory, namely, the Standard Model of particle physics (for a recent visual description of the Standard Model, see [2]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the question arises, “What about gravity?”. It turns out that quantum mechanics does not play any significant role in the gravitational interactions that, say, govern the dynamics of our Solar system. This is true even for gravitational interactions at much larger scales, say galaxies, galaxy clusters and so on. Does that mean that we should not bother incorporating quantum theory into our models of gravity? The answer is NO! The reason is that there are scenarios in nature where both the effects of quantum mechanics as well as gravitational interactions are believed to be equally significant. One such scenario occurs, for instance, when we consider physics at the very early stages of our Universe. There is a simple trick that physicists use to decide whether a physical scenario demands a quantum theory of gravity. The idea is to check whether the typical length, time and energy scales of a given physical situation is comparable to a set of constants called the Planck length, Planck time and Plack energy, respectively. The reason this works is because the aforementioned &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Planck quantities' are defined solely in terms of the fundamental constants &lt;/code&gt;c’ (the speed of light), &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;h’ (the Planck’s constant) and &lt;/code&gt;G’ (gravitational constant)[3]. Recall that Planck’s constant (h) corresponds to quantum mechanics, the speed of light ( c ) to relativity and the gravitational constant (G), of course, to gravity. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Planck quantities’ (constructed with h,c and G) correspond to &lt;/code&gt;quantum theories with general relativistic gravity’! Now, imagine the very early stages of the universe, say, just after or during the Big-Bang, when our universe was extremely `tiny’. During that era, the typical length, time and energy scales are believed to become comparable to the corresponding Planck quantities, hence signaling the need for a quantum theory of gravity to explain the physics at that time. A similar argument can also be made for the extremely dense interior of a black-hole, indicating that quantum gravity effects might be relevant there as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, a ‘quantum theory of gravity’ (translates to “a consistent model of gravitational interaction that incorporates principles of quantum mechanics”) is crucial to understand nature deeply. Unfortunately, however, one of the major challenges in theoretical physics today is to combine the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, into a coherent quantum theory for gravity. The reason gravity has not been tamed this way is primarily because it is not simply a `force’ in the conventional sense. To better understand what makes gravity different, let us briefly review how gravity is described in Einstein’s general theory of relativity (GTR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einstein taught us that ‘spacetime’– the union of space (the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;where’) and time (the &lt;/code&gt;when’)– is the most natural construct to base our understanding of gravity. When there is no matter, spacetime is quite uninteresting and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flat’, say, like a flat rubber sheet. The presence of matter introduces non-trivial geometric features  on the spacetime, somewhat analogous to how placing a heavy ball on the rubber sheet stretches it.  Gravity, it turns out, is just a manifestation of such geometric features of spacetime. The geometry, in turn, can be mathematically described by a quantity called &lt;/code&gt;metric tensor’. Imagine the metric tensor as an object that tells us two basic pieces of information about the spacetime: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;distances’ between two nearby points and &lt;/code&gt;angles’ between intersecting lines in the spacetime. Einstein’s famous field equations determine the precise manner in which metric tensor behaves in the presence of matter. On the other hand, in the absence of gravity, physicists usually consider the other interactions to play out in a flat background spacetime, much like how dancers (forces and particles) perform in an inert stage (spacetime). However, the presence of gravity has the consequence that the spacetime itself is dynamic! (Imagine the stage itself performing with the dancers!) To combine quantum mechanics with a realistic theory in which the spacetime itself is dynamic is a major challenge that theoretical physicists are facing even now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1980’s Padmanabhan, along with his supervisor Prof. Jayant V Narlikar, made significant progress in tackling this challenge. An ingenious idea that was the key to some of their works was to consider a simpler scenario in which the dynamic content of gravity is captured by only a ‘piece’ of the metric-tensor, called the conformal factor. Roughly speaking, what this simple scenario meant was that they considered only the distance-providing piece of the metric tensor to be dynamic while restricting the angles to be &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fixed’ (Recall that metric-tensor gives us &lt;/code&gt;distances’ and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;angles’ in spacetime.). It turns out that this piece of gravity can be combined with quantum theory in a relatively straightforward way. Therefore, they could perform several calculations that would have been difficult or even impossible in attempts towards a &lt;/code&gt;full’ quantum theory of gravity.  Although their model might sound simple, it leads to important insights about the structure of the universe and spacetime in general, of which here we shall briefly look at only two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going into the insights that emerged from Padmanabhan’s and his collaborators’ studies, we have to understand certain basics of our universe’s past. There is irrefutable evidence now that our universe is expanding at an accelerated pace. What this implies is that if we imagine the evolution of our universe as a movie and play it in reverse, we would expect that the universe is contracting. Now, using the principles of general relativity and the assumption that our universe is made of reasonably realistic matter content , this thought experiment leads to the fact that the universe must have emerged from a single point in the past! Such a point is technically called a ‘singularity’ [4] and, in physics, the presence of such singularities signifies potential deficiencies of a theoretical framework. It is generally believed that a quantum theory of gravity would cure this problem. One of the important insights that emerged out of the works of Padmanabhan and Narlikar was that this belief is in fact well-founded.  For instance, one of the outcomes of their simple model was that the singularity at the beginning of our universe may be absent when quantum theory is considered! This might be viewed as a strong indication that a more complete quantum theory of gravity may also have the cure for singularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another result that came out of their studies was that the distance between two points in spacetime cannot be made arbitrarily small, instead, there could be a lower limit called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;zero-point length’. This is quite counter-intuitive because our intuition is that as we bring two points closer and closer, the distance between them eventually becomes zero! The reason for the breaking of our intuition is that quantum effects potentially modify the structure of spacetime at the smallest length scales. In fact, it is found that the presence of &lt;/code&gt;zero-point length’, or something resembling that concept, is a universal feature in several approaches to a quantum theory of gravity. This later motivated Padmanabhan and his collaborators to also investigate the implications of the ‘zero-point length’ in several other important contexts in theoretical physics, which eventually led to many useful physical insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The formation of large scale structures in the universe is probably the problem requiring a solution in cosmology.”
— Thanu Padmanabhan
(Source: http://www.iucaa.in/~paddy/)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At sufficiently large scales, our universe is quite homogeneous and isotropic [5]. It is important to understand what one means by ‘sufficiently large scale’. To understand this better, let us consider a very large white sheet of paper. When looked at with naked eyes, the paper looks the same no matter at what point on the paper we are looking and which direction we are looking. But, if we zoom in using a powerful microscope, we will see that the paper is made of a network of microscopic plant fibres, which are arranged to form a uniform flat sheet at scales visible to our naked eyes. Of course, if we zoom in further, we will also find that the fibres themselves are made of cells, which in turn is made of molecules and so on. Similarly, in our universe, the stars are organized into galaxies, which in turn form galaxy groups that form galaxy clusters. These clusters are then arranged into filament-like structures, sheet-like structures and so on. Such large structures are separated by immense voids, hence creating a somewhat foamy texture to our universe, at a very large scale. Just as a paper looks homogeneous to us at scales greater than, say, a few millimetres (although it consists of intricate microscopic plant fibres), our universe is homogeneous at scales much greater than a few hundred million light-years (although, at smaller scales, it consists of several structures like galaxies, galaxy clusters, filaments etc., at various levels).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the universe is quite homogeneous at sufficiently large scales and at the same time has elaborate structures at smaller scales provides us an important clue about the state of our universe when it was much younger. Scientists believe that in the very early stages of our universe, the density of matter must have been remarkably uniform (hence, the large-scale smoothness we observe today!). However, there must also have been very small variations in this density, as we move from one place to another in the universe. The large scale structures in our universe, that we described earlier, are believed to have formed due to the gravitational field of such density fluctuations. However, the precise manner in which these `primordial’ density fluctuations led to the formation of large scale structures is still not completely understood analytically. Efficient computer simulations have been developed by several scientists and collaborations to make progress in understanding this problem. Although such simulations are helpful in making concrete predictions, they often do not provide us with clear physical insight. To gain more insight one needs a greater analytical handle. According to Padmanabhan, “This is important since some people in this field use computers the way a drunkard uses a lamppost - for support, not illumination.” [6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Padmanabhan contributed significantly to this direction by employing a wide range of tools in theoretical physics, which include, in particular, statistical mechanics. For instance, although the problem of cluster formation itself, in its entirety, is difficult to study analytically, Padmanabhan proposed a simple model in which one can divide the process of formation of structure into three convenient regimes. Each of these regimes was defined such that they could be independently dealt with reasonable analytical ease. He then proceeded to show how the results, in the three independent regimes, can be carefully combined to make predictions that are in good agreement with those from computer simulations. Such an approach shed more light on the underlying physics that drives the structure formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cosmological-constant-and-the-microstructure-of-spacetime&quot;&gt;Cosmological constant and the microstructure of spacetime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observations show that our universe is expanding at an accelerated rate. The current accelerated expansion, in turn, seems to indicate that our universe is uniformly filled with a rather strange kind of energy called ‘Dark Energy’. Unlike other kinds of matter and energy, dark energy seems to create a sort of repulsive force at large scales, which tends to accelerate the expansion of our universe. It turns out that the effect of a uniform distribution of dark energy is mathematically equivalent to introducing a certain fundamental constant to Einstein’s field equations of general theory relativity. In this picture, dark energy is viewed as the manifestation of a new fundamental constant for our universe, called the cosmological constant. Moreover, to best explain the current observations, the cosmological constant must be a very small positive value, in a suitable unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, according to the principles of quantum field theory (QFT), which is another pillar of theoretical physics, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vacuum’ has a certain energy content and this energy has the same effect as that of a cosmological constant. I should caution that the term &lt;/code&gt;vacuum’ technically means the lowest energy state of a system. Moreover, due to quantum effects, the `vacuum’ in QFT, unlike the vacuum in the English dictionary(vacuum = a space entirely devoid of matter), has a richer structure. Consequently, the vacuum, according to QFT, must have a certain energy which is referred to as the ‘vacuum energy’. Since this vacuum energy also has an effect similar to the introduction of a cosmological constant, a certain fraction of the observed value of the cosmological constant must be the contribution from the vacuum energy. The problem, however, is that theoretically, this contribution seems to be gigantically larger than the observed value of the cosmological constant! This embarrassing disagreement between the observed value of the cosmological constant and the theoretical value of vacuum energy is referred to as the cosmological constant problem [7].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Padmanabhan, to resolve the cosmological constant problem, one must start by admitting that at the deeper level, spacetime is not the fundamental object describing gravity. Spacetime and gravity, according to Padmanabhan, must emerge from more fundamental microscopic structures. This is similar to how a large number of microscopic H2O molecules interact to form the emergent fluid that we call water. He also claimed, with compelling reasons, that a deeper theory of gravity should be sensitive to only the fluctuations of the vacuum energy, instead of the vacuum energy itself. In this framework, one should identify the cosmological constant with the fluctuations of the vacuum energy, instead of the total vacuum energy itself, which we already saw was gigantically large.  This furnishes a compelling approach for resolving the cosmological constant problem, which is still being seriously explored by many researchers across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that fluids, which is an example of emergent phenomena, are described to some extent by a set of equations called the Navier-Stokes equations. Moreover, the presence of microscopic structure also implies that one can ascribe thermodynamic properties to these fluids. These thermodynamic quantities, in turn, must also satisfy certain thermodynamic identities. On the other hand, we have already seen that the dynamics of spacetime is described by Einstein’s field equations. To summarize, while emergent objects are characterized by certain kinds of features and related equations, gravity (or equivalently spacetime) is described by, what seems like, a totally different kind of equations. How does one reconcile this with the fact that spacetime(gravity) is emergent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Padmanabhan and his collaborators showed that Einstein’s general relativity itself already contains strong evidence for the claim that spacetime is emergent. For example, they showed that when Einstein’s equations are suitably reformulated, it takes the form of the Navier-Stokes equation! In addition, in a different setting, Einstein’s equations also acquire the form of thermodynamic identities! They also demonstrated that this is a feature of a larger class of theories of gravity that are extensions of Einstein’s general relativity. This, clearly, can be considered as a strong hint of the emergent nature of spacetime and hence, gravity. This raises the deeper question: If spacetime is emergent, like say water, what is its microscopic structure, analogous to how water consists of microscopic H20 molecules? In his last decade, Padmanabhan had constantly considered this question, the answer to which would revolutionize physics forever. He also believed that the difficulties with combining quantum theory with gravity primarily arise because one usually assumes spacetime as the fundamental variable to describe gravity, while it is actually only an emergent variable. The answer to the above question could also lead to the simultaneous resolution of two of the most fundamental challenges in theoretical physics: (1) formulating a quantum theory of gravity and (2) the cosmological constant problem. If experimental and theoretical confirmation of Padmanabhan’s revolutionary perspective on gravity emerges in the future, it would mark the third significant paradigm shift in our understanding of gravity, following Newton’s law of gravitation and Einstein’s general theory of relativity!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>From Sun to Earth using Artificial Intelligence</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The focus of this article is solar wind. I first take the reader through the theory &amp;amp; observations, and various properties of solar wind. Then, I take a detour through machine and deep learning which form the basis of our work. Finally, I take the reader through our work on predicting, and investiagting sources of solar wind using deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt; This article was originally given as a talk to the students of the Astro club of Fergusson college, Pune on 24 August 2021 .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night sky is one of the most primal sources of curiosities for many living creatures - more so for humanity. If you live in a village/town without the glaring lights and pollution, you can see the beautiful night sky dotted with stars, and possibly also the majestic &lt;em&gt;Ganga of the heavens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In the backdrop of these stars which follow regular paths in the sky lie the wanderers, who seem to move like kids in a park. Though these wanderers (or Planets, as we know them now) seem to move here and there, they also move in periodic paths that can &lt;em&gt;very nearly&lt;/em&gt; be predicted. However, humans would see very different objects once in a while- sometimes with a tail of smoke, sometimes falling to the Earth, and sometimes as a guest star. These &lt;em&gt;apparently unpredictable&lt;/em&gt; events would cause panic in people, and lead to associating such events with ‘good’ or ‘bad’ omens. One such class of objects which have long been observed, and feared by humans is the comets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thousand years have passed since, and now we know what these comets are (and hopefully given up on the superstition!). These are rocky balls covered with dust and ice which orbit the Sun in highly eccentric orbits. This means we see many of these comets extremely rarely – for instance, we can see Halley’s comet only once in 76 years&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fig.1, an image of the comet Hale-Boop is shown. This image came in as an &lt;em&gt;Astronomy Picture Of the Day&lt;/em&gt;. You will notice that by and large the comet has two general parts – a “nucleus” and a “tail”. The nucleus is the core, rocky body of the comet, while the tail is the fuzzy smoke-like stream coming out from the nucleus. As you will further notice, there are two tails for this comet. These tails are the white “dust” tail and the blue “ion” tail. If you draw a line connecting the Sun and the comet’s nucleus, the ion tail points directly away from the Sun, while the dust tail lags a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This observation was not missed by astronomers in the 1940s and 50s, and many sought to explain why this was the case. Then, in 1951, Ludwig Biermann proposed that while the dust tail comes due to the nucleus getting hot (so ice simply evaporates), the ion tail comes due to charged particles hitting the comet &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1951ZA.....29..274B/abstract&quot;&gt;(Biermann L., 1951)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a rather startling proposition. Remember, just a little over 50 years prior to this paper, Michelson and Morley had shown that interplanetary space is empty, with no matter. Then where would these charged particles come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1958, Eugene Parker at the University of Chicago submitted a paper to The &lt;em&gt;Astrophysical Journal&lt;/em&gt; on “Interplanetary gas and magnetic field”. He had asked the question: what happens to a star like the Sun, with a hot atmosphere&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, as we move away from it? Parker had found that the atmospheric pressure pushes the atmosphere into a wind of particles, streaming across the solar system, and into the interplanetary medium. He called this the solar wind. Now, there was no shred of evidence &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt; for such a large scale wind (remember, Biermann had only hypothesized - science needs evidence&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), and the referees&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; rejected the paper while not finding any particular fault with it! But the journal’s editor was Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar - the man who had theoretically, among other things, predicted that a white dwarf can be stable only within a certain mass limit now called the Chandrasekhar limit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2514598.Chandrasekhar_And_His_Limit&quot;&gt;(Venkataraman G., 1992)&lt;/a&gt;. Chandrasekhar found Parker’s paper to be well done mathematically, and hence overrode the referees to publish it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23615374-nature-s-third-cycle&quot;&gt;(Arnab Rai Choudhuri, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1958ApJ...128..664P/abstract&quot;&gt;; Parker, E. N., 1958)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parker predicted quantities like velocity and pressure of the solar wind. He also performed a calculation of how the magnetic field of the Sun would look like in the solar wind. He found that the field lines would be buffeted in an Archimedian spiral, shown in Fig.2. In 1959, the Soviet probe &lt;a href=&quot;https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1959-012A&quot;&gt;Luna 1&lt;/a&gt; was launched with experiments to the moon. However, it performed measurements across the interplanetary space and found signatures of these high speed particles coming from the Sun. Thus, observationally, the hypothesis of the solar wind was validated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This caused an explosion of science on the solar wind. Then, sometime in the 1990s, the spacecraft Ulysses was launched to study the Sun from its equator to its poles. It tried to associate, on average, the source of the solar wind on the Sun. This observation is shown as the complicated Fig. 3, with an image of the Sun in the background, and the solar wind speed measurements as the lines. To read this plot, imagine that you are moving on a circle around the Sun’s image. The smaller your circle (closer to the Sun), slower is the wind – larger your circle, the faster the wind is. Ulysses found that the solar wind that comes approximately from the equator is slow - less than 500 km/s  - and highly variable. The solar wind coming from the poles is much faster, peaks at around 700 km/s, and is quite steady. This observation suggested that the solar wind comes in two &lt;em&gt;modalities&lt;/em&gt; - slow and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/from_sun_to_earth_vishal_images/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This opened Pandora’s box. Scientists started tackling these observations with two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the differences between the fast and the slow wind?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which regions in the Sun give rise to the two wind modalities?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What physical processes give rise to the two wind modalities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, scientists found some clues on all the differences and which regions in the Sun give rise to the two modalities. First, both the winds have quite different compositions. This is an extremely technical topic for a later day, but it is enough to know that different ions are present in different proportions in the slow wind. But what about the “source regions” of the solar wind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fig. 4, I show the results obtained by Wang and Sheeley in 1990. They studied areas on the Sun called Coronal Holes &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990ApJ...355..726W/abstract&quot;&gt;(Wang and Sheeley, 1990)&lt;/a&gt; (henceforth, I call them CHs), which are seen as dark structures in the solar corona, and represent regions where magnetic field lines are open. Wang and Sheeley found that the fast wind speed showed variations similar to the CH area. So they hypothesized that the fast wind comes, at least in some measure, from CHs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p float=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/from_sun_to_earth_vishal_images/image4a.png&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/from_sun_to_earth_vishal_images/image4b.png&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slow wind, on the other hand, is very tenuous. David Brooks and collaborators measured the composition of the solar corona, and attempted to narrow down on the origin of the solar wind &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6947&quot;&gt;(Brooks D. et al., 2015)&lt;/a&gt;. Brooks and others found that the Active Regions (ARs)  boundaries show composition similar to the slow wind, and conjectured that the slow wind comes from these regions. The ARs are bright, complex structures that consist of numerous closed loops of magnetic field, holding hot plasma. However, in 2019, the Parker Solar Probe observations showed that the slow wind seems to come from CHs near the equator &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31802007/&quot;&gt;(Bale S. et al., 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. These are shown in Fig. 5. In summation, these observations showed how we could find potential sources of the solar wind by mapping the “wind properties” to “solar coronal properties”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p float=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/from_sun_to_earth_vishal_images/image5a.png&quot; width=&quot;370&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I and collaborators (or rather, my mentors!) were studying a slightly different problem. We were trying to develop a model that can &lt;em&gt;predict&lt;/em&gt; what the solar wind measured near Earth, given coronal data. Since we don’t know the exact locations of the sources of different solar wind modalities, we were trying to understand how best we can circumvent this problem and automatically figure out the solar wind given an approximate source region. What inspired us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI). When we started our work, we were at the cusp of rapid development and revival of machine &amp;amp; deep learning algorithms. AI is a cool word that generally makes us think of Ultron, Jarvis, Transformers, or even the robot TARS from Interstellar. But in reality, it is a broad term for a set of algorithms that can ‘tune’ and ‘learn’ from the data. A simple example is shown in Fig. 6. What you see here is a game, like Need for Speed. Generally, a player controls the steering and throttle of the car, ensuring it stays in lane (or at least follows a trajectory). Fig. 6 is similar, except that the throttle and steering angle are adaptively ‘learned’ by an AI as we keep feeding in the car images at each instant. The core idea is similar to what is employed by self-driving cars. How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/from_sun_to_earth_vishal_images/image6.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Fig. 6: A game showing the motion of a car along a road. No human is playing this game -- rather, a machine learning algorithm is predicting what the steering angle and throttle are, given each frame. Image Credits: &lt;a href=&quot;https://sergioskar.github.io/Self_driving_cars/&quot;&gt; Sergios Karagiannakos &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We interpreted from such development that the core idea behind such self driving car setups is to consider a time series of images, and generate a set of real values. The AI automatically figures out what the car is, where the car is, how fast it is moving, and so on. The AI does this by “predicting” the throttle and steering angle, matching the actual needed throttle and steering values, and iteratively reducing the error. Think of it as studying for an exam - you attempt to practise tests, and sure you will not get all the questions correct. But as you keep studying, you will keep learning more and more, and keep getting better and better. But what has this got to do with the Sun?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We figured out that we study the Sun simply through a bunch of “images” of the Sun, while the solar wind speed is just a bunch of real values. And so, the solar wind speed prediction is pretty much complimentary to getting self-driving cars moving correctly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then went ahead, and developed a complex AI called “WindNet”, which takes in images from the Sun and puts out the solar wind speed as a prediction. The WindNet showed pretty good performance – in fact, it was much better than the heuristically used models, and could predict 5-7 days in advance! This was a pretty cool result for a model which has no physics as input – we did not quite tell the model where the solar wind comes from!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till now people have asked what the solar wind is like, if you give an intelligently guessed region on the Sun. But our work has shown that we can ask the reverse question: with an AI which can predict the wind speed, can we ask which regions on the Sun it thinks are important for wind speed prediction? We asked an AI, trained purely on data, and not fed in with any physics, to answer a physics problem. Will it replicate known physics, or will it answer garbage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question we asked our model was: Where does the fast wind come from? The answer is shown in Fig. 7. The AI thinks that CHs are important for a fast wind prediction, and that too four days before prediction. This was pretty cool – we have seen that the CHs can give rise to fast wind, and the time taken to reach Earth is within the time frame of fast wind travel time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/from_sun_to_earth_vishal_images/image7.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we asked our model: where does the slow wind come from? The response is shown in Fig. 8. The AI thinks that the ARs are important slow wind sources 5-7 days prior to prediction. This is in line with the observation of Brooks and collaborators. However, our AI also thinks the CHs are just a &lt;em&gt;teensy bit&lt;/em&gt; important for the slow wind prediction. This is in line with the observation of Bale and collaborators. This was very interesting to us - AI systems have the potential to figure out the sources of the solar wind, without explicitly feeding in any physics mapping! How cool is that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/from_sun_to_earth_vishal_images/image8.png&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Fig. 8: The slow wind prediction, with the solar image on top, and importance map in the bottom. Blue corresponds to less important regions, while red corresponds to more important regions. Image courtesy: Author.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we evaluated this result statistically. That is, for all CHs, and all ARs, if one looks at this &lt;em&gt;average importance&lt;/em&gt;, does it quite conform to known physics? Technical details apart, we found that the fast wind association to CHs was seen clearly by AI, with even the timing coming correct. However, while the slow wind showed strong relation to the ARs, the timing was quite wrong. This tells us that AI presents a potential way of studying the Sun, and the connection between Sun and Earth. However, it also needs to be perfectly trained to generate the mapping, and needs as much data as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a new era we enter, with the assimilation of AI with physics to generate models, target specific tasks, and even do good science. Let us take a giant leap forward in a quest to figure out the secrets of the Universe, aided by AI!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Understanding the evolution of the binary star system ‘Cen X-3’: New measurements of the spin and orbital parameters of the system </title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Researchers from Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, present the new measurements of the spin and orbital parameters of the binary star system ‘Cen X-3’. This work is a step forward in understanding the complex dynamics of the binary star systems and their evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Cen X-3’&lt;/strong&gt; is a binary star system observed in the constellation &lt;em&gt;‘Centaurus’&lt;/em&gt;. It is one of the most luminous X-ray sources in our galaxy and the first-ever X-ray pulsar to be discovered.
Scientists from the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune present the &lt;strong&gt;new measurements of spin and orbital parameters of ‘Cen X-3’&lt;/strong&gt;. The results are crucial in &lt;strong&gt;understanding the life-cycle and evolution of X-ray binary systems&lt;/strong&gt;. The work is published in the &lt;em&gt;‘Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy on AstroSat: Five Years in Orbit’&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers used the data from the &lt;strong&gt;Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters (LAXPCs)&lt;/strong&gt; onboard &lt;strong&gt;Astrosat&lt;/strong&gt;, for the analysis. &lt;strong&gt;Astrosat&lt;/strong&gt; is India’s first dedicated multi-wavelength space telescope launched by the &lt;em&gt;Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)&lt;/em&gt; in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cen X-3&lt;/strong&gt; is a two-star system consisting of a &lt;strong&gt;pulsar&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;highly magnetized neutron star beaming X-rays&lt;/em&gt;, and a companion star. The neutron star is an extremely compact object; &lt;em&gt;as massive as our sun but only a few kilometers across in size!&lt;/em&gt; The neutron star in Cen X-3 gravitationally accretes matter from its companion star. The kinetic energy of the infalling matter is converted to other forms of energy including electromagnetic radiation. The neutron star’s magnetic field dictates the accretion flow inside the magnetosphere. The accreting matter is channeled along the magnetic field lines and onto the magnetic poles forming an accretion column. The neutron star’s rotational axis is not necessarily aligned with its magnetic axis. Such &lt;em&gt;misalignment&lt;/em&gt; gives rise to &lt;em&gt;highly periodic pulsations&lt;/em&gt; hence the name &lt;strong&gt;‘pulsars’&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/Understanding-the-evolution-of-the-binary-star-system-Cen-X-3-ketan-images/image1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A new image here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Figure 1: Illustration of an accretion-powered pulsar. The magnetic axis sweeps earth in every rotation of the neutron star due to misalignment between the rotational axis and the magnetic axis giving rise to highly periodic pulsations.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both stars are gravitationally bound and revolve around each other. The binary orbit can evolve due to matter exchange between the stars, mass loss from the binary system, and due to tidal interaction between the two stars. Studying the evolution of the orbit of such systems is important in understanding stellar structure and evolution. The results of these studies can be a &lt;strong&gt;direct test for stellar structure models and evolution theories&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;first step in doing such a study is to determine the binary orbit&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In systems like Cen X-3, the companion star is almost 10-15 times heavier than the neutron star. Thus the center of mass of the binary system is much closer to the center of the companion star than the neutron star. In such cases, one can visualize the binary orbit, as illustrated in figure 2 where the neutron star is orbiting around the companion star.  Due to its motion in the binary orbit, the neutron star moves back and forth along the line of sight. The observed frequency of the pulses from the neutron star is shifted due to this motion owing to the phenomenon called the &lt;strong&gt;‘Doppler effect’&lt;/strong&gt;. Due to this effect, &lt;em&gt;when the neutron star is moving towards the observer, the pulses arrive faster and when the neutron star is moving away from the observer, the pulses are delayed&lt;/em&gt; as shown in figure 2.
This results in a periodic variation with time in the observed pulse frequency. The rate of this variation corresponds to the orbital period of the system. For a perfectly circular orbit, the pulse frequency variation is sinusoidal. The deviation from the sinusoidal behavior is indicative of the eccentricity in the orbit. Eccentricity is a measure of how elongated the orbit is. The eccentricity of a perfectly circular orbit is zero. The higher the eccentricity, the more elongated the orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The binary orbit can be &lt;strong&gt;determined completely&lt;/strong&gt; from this. For a system with a nearly circular orbit like Cen X-3, &lt;strong&gt;parameters that can describe the system dynamics&lt;/strong&gt; completely are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neutron star spin period and its rate of change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Period of the binary orbit and its rate of change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Orbital velocity and radius&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eccentricity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the orbit can be understood by comparing the orbital parameters at various instances of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parisee Shirke (IUCAA, Pune) and the team&lt;/strong&gt; found that the &lt;strong&gt;spin period&lt;/strong&gt; of the neutron star has reduced to &lt;strong&gt;4.80s&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;4.81s&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that the neutron star is &lt;strong&gt;spinning up&lt;/strong&gt; which is as per its known behavior. However, the rate at which the neutron star is spinning up has halved. This can be due to &lt;strong&gt;variation in the rate of matter accretion from the companion star&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;orbital period&lt;/strong&gt; was found to be around &lt;strong&gt;2.03 days&lt;/strong&gt;. The rate of change of the orbital period was observed to be &lt;strong&gt;substantially large compared to the previously reported values&lt;/strong&gt;. The authors state that this &lt;strong&gt;could be due to short time-scale variations&lt;/strong&gt; in the orbital period. The &lt;strong&gt;orbital velocity&lt;/strong&gt; is measured to be around &lt;strong&gt;410 Km/s&lt;/strong&gt; which agrees with the previous measurements. The &lt;strong&gt;projected radius&lt;/strong&gt; of the orbit has decreased from &lt;strong&gt;39.66 lt-s&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;38.23 lt-s&lt;/strong&gt;. This change is &lt;strong&gt;in accordance with the observed orbital decay&lt;/strong&gt; in Cen X-3. The binary orbit is observed to be &lt;strong&gt;nearly circular&lt;/strong&gt; with a very small eccentricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work is a step forward in understanding the &lt;strong&gt;complex dynamics of the binary star systems and their evolution&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
