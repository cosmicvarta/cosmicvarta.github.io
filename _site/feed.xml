        <title>A list of scholarships for women in Science</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A significant fraction of the advances in science and technology arises due to seminal contributions by women - all the while tackling a series of battles against social norms and skewed opportunities. Even today, there exists a lack of representation of women in higher education, scientific research and industry. For instance, women make up almost 43% of STEM (i.e. Science Technology Engineering and Medicine) graduates in the country, but just 14% scientists and engineers in universities/institutions. A “leaky STEM pipeline” is formed as only 3-6% of women enroll for a PhD in STEM. Even though many injustices exist as hurdles to women empowerment, various governments and organizations have come forward in combating these issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective ways to empower women is through education. An educated woman has the capability, knowledge and independence to take up various avenues in life independently - especially in STEM. Education starts not just at a very specialized stage, but right from primary school – where children are instilled with the dreams of exploring the edge of the universe or breaking open the smallest of particles. Poverty, the unfortunate condition that plagues a large part of our country is especially detrimental to the education of girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, in this article, we present our humble attempt at compiling a set of scholarships which are aimed at covering the education costs of girls. We have presented the scholarship data in three groups - school education, undergraduate studies, and post graduation. For each group we have presented the eligibility criteria and the scholarship amount in multiple columns, while we have linked the homepage of each scholarship for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not claim this to be an exhaustive list - in fact, this will be a “living” document which shall get updated as and when we get more information. If you, the reader, think we have missed an important scholarship scheme, please give us a shout out through the comments section below, or by contacting us directly through the form.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Voices of the Women in Science - A list of books on women scientists </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Progress is possible only when everyone capable of contributing is given an equal chance irrespective of gender, community and nationality. While there is a long way to go before this gap is fulfilled, it should be noted that we as a community have made considerable strides in meeting this agenda. Even at the dawn of independence, the majority of women were not even given a chance to study but now, in 70 years, we can happily say that women are not only earning degrees and doctorates but actively leading the world on major scientific, technological and industrial fronts!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in India, as is in every other country, have an unequal gender work environment. In this regard, the United Nations General Assembly has declared February 11 as the &lt;strong&gt;International Day of Women and Girls in Science&lt;/strong&gt; to inspire and engage women and girls in STEM, with the hope that more girls take up science and research as a career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the number of women in science and technology is less, their contributions are not! In order to celebrate their contributions, we at &lt;strong&gt;CosmicVarta&lt;/strong&gt; have collated a list of books that commemorate the immense contribution that women across the world have made to science with an intention to inspire and arouse a scientific temper in the reader. These books show us how these trailblazers, pioneers and path-breakers’ lives were and what inspired them to become scientists! This list is definitely not exhaustive and we hope that many more books will be written on the contemporary women scientists as well the future stars. Here is the list of books we have compiled:&lt;/p&gt;

The sky is definitely not the limit for Indian women scientists. India became the first country to reach Mars, in 2013, that too in its first attempt. This mission, among others, was led by a group of brilliant and dedicated women scientists of ISRO. This book narrates how these magnificent women overcame gender-barriers and succeeded to achieve the impossible!   &lt;/p&gt;

Kalpana Chawla was the first woman of Indian origin to become an astronaut. Undeniably, she is an inspiration to millions of Indians, and not just women. Most school currilulum also have a chapter dedicated to this hero! While Kalpana Chawla died when returning from her second space flight on-board the space shuttle 'Columbia' in 2003, she is immortalized in this book.   &lt;/p&gt;

Henrietta Leavitt measured star positions and sizes from photographs taken by the telescope at the Harvard College Observatory. Henrietta observed that certain stars had a fixed pattern to their changes which later made it possible for astronomers to measure distances, leading to our present understanding of the vast size of the universe. Henrietta's story makes a great inspirational read for young researchers!&lt;/p&gt;

This is an extraordinary tale of a group of women who worked together and helped produce much of the data on which our understanding of the universe progressed during the 19th and 20th centuries. They carefully analyzed around half a million glass photographic plates which contained images of the universe taken from the Harvard telescopes. They helped discern what stars were made of, divided the stars into meaningful categories for further research, and found a way to measure distances across space by starlight.  &lt;/p&gt;

The Nobel Prize awardee list shows an astonishing disparity in the representation of women scientists. This book narrates the lives and achievements of 15 women scientists who have won a Nobel Prize or part of a Nobel Prize- winning project. Even in the midst of relenless discrimination, their love for science pushed them for science.&lt;/p&gt;

The book narrates the unsung story of Mary Anning, a twelve year who discovered the first dinosaur skeleton--of an ichthyosaur--while fossil hunting on the cliffs of Lyme Regis, England. The inspiration behind popular tongue-twister &quot;She Sells Sea Shells by the Seashore&quot;, she attracted the attention of fossil collectors and the scientific world alike. Her peculiar finds helped lay the groundwork for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, laid out in his On the Origin of Species. Darwin based Mary's fossilized creatures as irrefutable evidence that life in the past was nothing like life in the present. &lt;/p&gt;

This illustrated biography narrates the story of Marie Tharp, a pioneering woman scientist and the first person to ever successfully map the ocean floor. Taught to think big by her father who was a cartographer, Marie wanted to map the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Despite failures and challenges where Marie would be turned away from a ship as having a woman on board was “bad luck”, Marie was determined to succeed. By mapping the ocean floor, Marie helped us better understand the planet we call home.&lt;/p&gt;

The book presents the story of two women, Irène Curie and  Lise Meitner, who did ground breaking in a male-dominated field of science. Curie was denied admission to the French Academy of sciences due to her gender, even though she had been awarded with the Nobel Prize. Meitner’s unique insight was critical to the revolution in science that led to nuclear energy and the race to build the atom bomb, yet her achievement was left unrecognized by the Nobel committee.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Astrobiology: Exploring the universe for signs of extra-terrestrial life</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The only life forms we know about are the ones that exist on Earth. Due to advancements in space exploration, it has become possible to send rovers, probes, space crafts, and telescopes in further deep space. With the help of these space missions and various other tools, astrobiologists are trying to find signatures of life on other planets, exoplanets, and various moons.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.	Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;Is life a cosmic phenomenon?&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;Are we alone in the universe?&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us have wondered about it at some point in our lives. Perhaps only a few would have wondered about what exactly is life. This might sound philosophical at first but it is equally scientific. Astrobiology tries to find answers to all these questions. It is the science that seeks to understand the story of life in the universe. We have not found explicit evidence of life so far but with unceasing curiosity and an inherent urge for exploration, scientists have discovered a lot. Being a multidisciplinary field, Astrobiology brings people with diverse backgrounds together to achieve a common goal – the search for life beyond Earth and beyond the solar system. The origin of life on Earth is a great mystery and therefore scientists are investigating the problem in several different ways.  Some are studying life on our own planet. Some are seeking out life or fossil life on other planets or moons in our solar system. Others are trying to detect life in other solar systems, either by measuring life’s effects on the atmospheres of distant planets or by measuring artificial radiation like radio signals that may be produced by advanced life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.	Life on Earth:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only know the nature of life as it exists on Earth. It is built around compounds that contain elements such as carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen. Complex sequences of these elements bond together, forming the very building blocks of life. They form essential organic molecules, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). However, these organic molecules did not naturally exist on Earth during the Hadean eon (4.0 billion years ago and preceding the existence life forms). The elements required existed only in inorganic form, bound up within the rocks, atmosphere and the early ocean.
It is estimated that life on Earth began at least 3.5 billion years ago, because that is the age of the oldest rocks with fossil evidence of life on Earth. Researchers suggest that in order to understand how life began on Earth, we need to understand the specific environmental conditions and other requirements that must be satisfied to allow this to occur. What are the habitability requirements of known Earth life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental habitability requirements are certainly some of the commonalities of life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;•	Energy:&lt;/strong&gt;
A source of energy is necessary for metabolism and to maintain the functions carried out by a cell. Life on Earth uses either solar energy or chemical energy sources that include both organic (carbon) compounds and inorganic elements and molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;•	Common essential elements:&lt;/strong&gt;
All known Earth life uses the same main set of elements to form biomolecules (CHNOPS) and shares a common carbon-based biochemistry. Carbon is an excellent element from which to build life, because carbon forms macromolecules with a variety of other elements and itself. Carbon forms primarily covalent bonds (compared to ionic bonds), and carbon-based molecules are stable in the presence of water and oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;•	Solvent:&lt;/strong&gt;
A solvent to host chemical interactions is considered a universal requirement for all life. With extensive evidence that all Earth life needs water specifically as the solvent, many astrobiologists consider water to be the most probable solvent for life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering whether an environment or planet is habitable, at a minimum, scientists take into account the potential energy source (or sources), the ambient chemical composition and whether this composition is suitable to build biomass, and the availability of a solvent. Additionally, there are physical constraints upon life (e.g., temperature, pressure, pH, salinity, radiation, metal toxicity) such that the presence of these habitability requirements may be necessary but not sufficient for life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1 Life on Earth is divided into three domains:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya (or Eucarya);&lt;/b&gt; Single-celled organisms are common in all three domains, and all organisms in the domains Archaea and Bacteria are single-celled. All multicellular organisms fall within the domain Eukarya. The term ‘‘prokaryotes’’ has traditionally been used to describe single-celled organisms that do not contain a nucleus, organelles, or a cytoskeleton (collectively, the domains Bacteria and Archaea). The majority of life on Earth is microbial, and astrobiologists extrapolate from that fact to conclude that the majority of any extraterrestrial life that may possibly exist is also likely to be microbial. Archaea and Bacteria are the focus of astrobiological studies due to the diversity of metabolic strategies utilized by them and their ability to thrive in extreme habitats, their pivotal role in Earth’s biogeochemical cycling, and the fact that single-celled organisms dominated the early history of life on Earth. Bacteria and Archaea harbour the vast majority of the genetic diversity of life on Earth. Scientists estimate that, to date, less than 1% of microbial life has been successfully cultivated (e.g., grown in the laboratory). Therefore, molecular methods that do not require cultivation are also used to detect the presence and genetic capabilities of microbes through DNA (metagenomics), RNA and gene expression activity (metatranscriptomics), and transcribed proteins (metaproteomics). These techniques have demonstrated that microbial populations are highly complex and that we have only begun to elucidate the full extent and capabilities of microbial life.&lt;/p&gt;

Fox et al. in 1990. Image source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576&quot;&gt;Carl Woese et al. (1990)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.2 Prevalence of life in extreme environments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When space agencies first began to explore the Solar System, scientists were not sure what they would find on the surfaces of planets like Mars and Venus. When space missions revealed Mars to be a frigid desert, and Venus a boiling cauldron, void of any obvious signs of life, astrobiologists began to wonder… what are the limits of habitability for life as we know it? How hot is too hot? How cold is too cold? How much acid can cells handle, and how little water can life survive on? Answering questions like these opened an entire field of study known as &lt;b&gt;extremophile research&lt;/b&gt;, where scientists examine the adaptations of organisms in conditions that are considered ‘extreme’ for life on Earth. These hardy lifeforms can help us better understand how life as we know it might originate, evolve, and reproduce in harsh environments in the Solar System and beyond. On a tour of extreme environments on Earth, a good place to start is with terrestrial hot springs. Good examples include Yellowstone National park in the United States, Rotorua in New Zealand and Puga hot spring in Ladakh, India These environments were the first to draw the interest of astrobiologists that study the limits of life on Earth, and they are arguably the first environment in which an extremophile, Thermus aquaticus was isolated and documented by scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These springs are where geothermally heated water from underground rises to the planet’s surface. They can act as a source of water, energy, and nutrients for living cells. The water boiling up from below can carry a wide variety of minerals and reduced chemical species that certain microbes can use as a source of energy. Microorganisms have been found here living in pools of up to 206 degrees Fahrenheit (97ºC). The composition of the water depends on many different factors, such as its source and the types of rock and soil it travels through. It’s not just the heat that challenges life’s survival in hot springs. Some springs have water that is very acidic, others have water that is extremely alkaline. Gases at concentrations poisonous to humans, and other animals, bubble up with the water. The rock and liquid can contain heavy metals like arsenic and lead, along with lots of other minerals and particulates. Some pools can be extremely salty, and are rich in potassium and sulphate. High temperatures also mean less dissolved oxygen, so many hydrothermal pools are low in oxygen content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multitude of harsh conditions present in terrestrial hot springs also means that it isn’t only thermophiles that live in these environments. There are acidophiles, alkaliphiles, and many other types of organisms. Sometimes scientists find extremophiles that use multiple adaptations to survive (polyextremophiles). On Earth, wherever we find liquid water, we find life, whether in bubbling hot springs, drops of brine inside ice, or films of water around minerals deep in the crust.
Up until 1977, scientists believed that all life on Earth was in some way dependent upon sunlight for energy. The discovery of hydrothermal vents showed that life could thrive independent of the Sun. Suddenly, scientists had an Earthly example of how life might survive on ocean worlds in the outer Solar System, such as Jupiter’s moon Europa, or Saturn’s moon Enceladus. These moons are thought to harbor oceans of dark, liquid water beneath their icy surfaces. If hydrothermal vents are present, those oceans could be habitable for life as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.3	How do we search for signs of life beyond Earth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astrobiological exploration is founded upon the premise that biosignatures encountered in space will be recognizable as presence of extraterrestrial life. A &lt;b&gt;biosignature&lt;/b&gt; is any substance – such as an element, isotope, or molecule – or phenomenon that provides scientific evidence of past or present life. The usefulness of a biosignature is determined not only by the probability of life creating it but also by the improbability of non-biological (abiotic) processes producing it. Concluding that evidence of an extraterrestrial life form (past or present) has been discovered requires proving that a possible biosignature was produced by the activities or remains of life. As with most scientific discoveries, discovery of a biosignature will require evidence building up until no other explanation exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, we can look for atmospheric gases such as oxygen or methane that can be produced by life. Such planetary features that indicate life are biosignatures. The simultaneous presence of oxygen and methane is evidence for life because these two gases should quickly react with each other unless a biosphere is producing great amounts of them, which prevents equilibrium. Microbial life will readily consume hydrogen or carbon monoxide gas, so an abundance of either of these might be considered an &lt;b&gt;anti-biosignature&lt;/b&gt; for a planet in the habitable zone.
&lt;b&gt;Eg.&lt;/b&gt; The presence of methane in the atmosphere of Mars is an area of ongoing research. Because of its tendency to be destroyed in the atmosphere by photochemistry, the presence of excess methane on a planet can be an indication that there must be an active source. With life being the strongest source of methane on Earth, observing a disequilibrium in the methane abundance on another planet could be a viable biosignature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.	Habitability in the solar system:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Earth it is absolutely logical to explore habitability of planets in our solar system. Planet Mars, in the inner solar system is a potential candidate to search for life beyond Earth. Simultaneously, moon of Jupiter (Europa) and moons of Saturn (Titan and Enceladus) in the outer solar system are also promising and extensive research is currently being conducted. The type of life that we are considering is simple, comparable to microbes, and the guiding principle concerns liquid water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.1 Mars:&lt;/strong&gt;
Many have imagined Mars, unlike Venus, as a potential abode for life. The atmosphere of Mars is much thinner than Earth’s. The Red Planet’s atmosphere contains more than 95% carbon dioxide and much less than 1% oxygen. Temperatures on Mars average about -81 degrees F. However, temperature’s range from around -220 degrees F in the wintertime at the poles, to +70 degrees F over the lower latitudes in the summer.
Mars Global Surveyor, which orbited from 1997 to 2006, mapped Mars and imaged sedimentary layers that implied many geologic cycles of erosion and deposition. In the early 21st century, the Mars Odyssey and Mars Express orbiters, along with Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, discovered areas of clay minerals and salts, which may have formed in liquid water. Twin Mars Exploration Rovers landed in 2004, and found fossilized ripples from past liquid water and sedimentary rocks, while in 2008, NASA’s Phoenix Lander dug up subsurface ice in a polar region and measured soluble salts in the soil. Finally, in 2012, Curiosity Rover trundled towards a 5-kilometre-high mountain of sedimentary beds within a 150- kilometre-diameter crater named Gale. It found mudstones deposited from water. Nowadays, astrobiological interest in Mars concerns either biological traces from billions of years ago or microbial-like life that might possibly endure in the subsurface or underground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mars’s current surface is hostile to life for three reasons. First, while ice exists for sure, no liquid water has been identified. The polar caps are water ice, topped with carbon dioxide ‘dry ice’ that grows when about 30 per cent of the atmosphere freezes at the winter pole. Also, above mid latitudes, ice cemented soil or permafrost lies just beneath the surface. In the tropics, afternoon temperatures in the top centimetre of soil rise above freezing, but there, ice turns to vapour before melting temperatures are reached. A second problem is no ozone layer, allowing harmful ultraviolet sunlight to reach the surface. Third, chemical reactions in the atmosphere make hydrogen peroxide— which settles to the surface, where they can destroy organics. While the surface is unpromising, geothermal heat underground might allow liquid water and life to exist. Evidence that liquid water used to be present suggests that Mars was once more habitable than today. Fluvial (stream-related) features in the landscape, including gullies, dried-up river valleys, deltas, and enormous channels are also indicative of the same. Moreover, the soil and rocks contain minerals that form in the presence of liquid water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.2 Jovian moon Europa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Galileo mission detected an induced magnetic field in Europa (a moon of Jupiter), providing compelling evidence for an ocean of liquid water beneath the surface. While the top surface of Europa is not habitable, it is still relevant to discuss here for several reasons: (1) surface materials may reflect the chemistry of a subsurface ocean and help us understand the conditions available to life there, and (2) materials brought to the surface from the ocean below may be the only way we can detect signs of life (e.g., organic matter or other biosignatures characterized spectroscopically on a future mission). Radiation from high-energy particles caught in Jupiter’s magnetic field causes oxidation of surface materials as the energy from radiation knocks electrons out of atoms. Radiolytically produced oxidants at the surface include O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These may be subsequently cycled into the ice shell and ocean on timescales on the order of the age of the surface, 106 years, which is quite young on geological timescales, so these compounds could potentially oxidize more reduced chemical species in the ocean below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.3 Icy moons of Saturn :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.3.1 Enceladus :&lt;/strong&gt;
Enceladus is Saturn’s sixth largest moon and has active geology. In 2005, the spacecraft Cassini started multiple close flybys of Enceladus, revealing its surface and environment in greater detail. It orbits Saturn in an elliptical fashion resulting in varying gravitational forces from Saturn that flex and heat Enceladus. For reasons that are not fully understood, the heating is concentrated under Enceladus’ South pole. There, icy particles and gas spray out of parallel fractures dubbed tiger stripes. The jets contain traces of methane, ammonia, and organic compounds, along with salt. Enceladus has a rocky core, an icy shell, and an underground sea beneath the area of the jets. The jackpot combination of organic molecules, energy, and liquid water implies that life might exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Image 6 : Narrow jets of gas and icy particles erupt from the south polar region of Enceladus, contributing to the moon's giant plume. A cycle of activity in these small-scale jets may be periodically lofting extra particles into space, causing the overall plume to brighten dramatically.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.3.2 Titan :&lt;/strong&gt;
Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, is also of astrobiological interest because it is the only satellite in the Solar System to have a thick atmosphere. In fact, the air pressure at Titan’s surface is 1.5 bar, which is 50 per cent larger than that at the Earth’s surface. The atmosphere of 95 per cent nitrogen and 5 per cent methane provides a 10°C greenhouse effect, but the sunlight at Saturn’s distance is one hundred times less intense than at Earth, so Titan’s surface is incredibly cold at –179°C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/astrobiology_shreya_images/image7.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Image 7 : NASA's Cassini spacecraft sees bright methane clouds drifting in the summer skies of Saturn's moon Titan, along with dark hydrocarbon lakes and seas clustered around the north pole. Image courtesy: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia21615-northern-summer-on-titan&quot;&gt;NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Titan’s atmosphere contains a smoggy haze of hydrocarbons. At high altitude, ultraviolet sunlight breaks up methane molecules (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and subsequent reactions build up hydrocarbons including ethane (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), acetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), propane (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), benzene (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), and reddish-brown particles containing polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The particles are called tholins. The products derived from methane sediment out of the atmosphere. In fact, about 20 per cent of Titan’s surface is covered in tropical dunes that are made of sand-sized particles, which are at least coated with organics if not made of them. At the poles, over 400 lakes are mixtures of liquid propane, ethane, and methane, with extraordinary beaches made of particles of benzene and acetylene.
Methane on Titan behaves like water on Earth and forms clouds, rain, and rivers. Most of our knowledge about Titan comes from the Cassini–Huygens mission, which arrived in 2004. Huygens landed on Titan in 2005. Titan flexes too much to be entirely solid, which is evidence that Titan has a subsurface ocean which might exist below an icy crust. Two types of life might exist on Titan: Earth-like life in the subsurface ocean; and non-DNA based life or life which has a different biochemistry in the hydrocarbon lakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.	Habitability beyond solar system :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding exoplanets is crucial before identifying a habitable one. With the vast distances involved, the search is difficult but nonetheless astronomers have developed two classes of methods. The first, indirect detection, looks for stellar properties, such as position or brightness, which are affected by the presence of unseen planets. The second is direct detection of a planet with an image or a spectrum of its light.
For astrobiology, the most important techniques are direct detections that capture light from a planet. Direct detection is challenging because a planet is a dim body close to a vastly brighter star. Nonetheless, telescopes in space, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Telescopes and extremely large telescopes on the ground have accomplished direct detection using a coronagraph, which is a mask to block the starlight. With density measurements, there are increasing clues about which exoplanets are made of gas, rock, water, or some mixture. We care most about exoplanets with liquid water right at the surface. These have the chance of a biosphere that pumps lots of gases into an atmosphere. In principle, such biogenic gases are detectable in the light from the planet and might indicate life.
If a planet is too far away from its host star it ices over, and if it’s too close it’s too hot for liquid water. The term habitable zone (HZ) refers to the region around a star in which an Earth-like planet could maintain liquid water on its surface at some instant in time. We specify a particular time because stars age and brighten or dim, so the HZ moves. The closest star to Earth is a triple-star system called Alpha Centauri which is at a 4.25 – 4.35 light years distance. The list of potentially habitable exoplanets is mostly based on estimates of habitability by the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog (HEC), and data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. The HEC is maintained by the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. Surface planetary habitability is thought to require orbiting at the right distance from the host star for liquid surface water to be present, in addition to various geophysical and geodynamical aspects, atmospheric density, radiation type and intensity, and the host star’s plasma environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.	Conclusion :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astrobiology is intriguing and challenging at the same time. Research done on origin of life and extremophiles is used to extrapolate to other planets and various moons in the solar system. Astrobiologists are primarily interested in the subsurface water oceans of these planets. Overall, follow the water has been the motto. All space agencies keep executing ambitious space missions probes, rovers, spacecrafts, telescopes, etc. Another aspect of Astrobiology which pushes science boundaries is exoplanet search. Habitable planets beyond our solar system are actively being sought after. Bio-signatures help us detect presence of Earth-like life in our solar system and beyond it. With the advancement in technology for space exploration one can expect that humans will exist as a multiplanetary species in future. There is a possibility that we are alone in the universe or who knows we might find life elsewhere. Till then let’s keep our fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shedding Light on the Cosmic Web with Fast Radio Bursts</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fast Radio Bursts are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin. Their dispersion measures are sensitive to the presence of ionized matter along their lines of sight. This unique measurable makes FRBs a promising cosmological probe that can shed light on a hitherto invisible matter reservoir that constitutes the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is one of the fastest developing fields of astronomical research.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Discovered serendipitously only in 2007 by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007Sci...318..777L/abstract&quot;&gt;Lorimer et al&lt;/a&gt;, FRBs are bright, millisecond-duration transient radio events. According to some &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013Sci...341...53T/abstract&quot;&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt;, thousands of FRBs occur in the sky daily. If one could see the sky in the radio frequencies, they would look like Fig.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/frb_sunil/image1.gif&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 1: An artist’s rendition of what FRBs look like in the radio wavelengths. &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/146295242&quot;&gt;Credit: NRAO outreach&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most FRBs detected have extragalactic origins with the only exception being two &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132c4202B/abstract&quot;&gt;recently discovered&lt;/a&gt; radio pulse emissions from a Milky Way &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetar&quot;&gt;magnetar&lt;/a&gt;, a compact remnant of a supernova that sports extremely strong magnetic fields, SGR 1935+2154. As the FRB pulses travel through space, they are dispersed by plasma (ionized matter) that permeates the universe, just like sunlight disperses in a prism into a rainbow. This means the higher frequency components of the pulse travel faster than the lower frequency waves. Fig. 2 shows the dispersed pulse reported by Lorimer et al. The amount of dispersion is quantified by the Dispersion Measure (DM). DM is defined as the line-of-sight integral of electron density, weighted by the cosmological scale factor. In Fig. 2, the DM essentially tells you how far apart the 1.5 GHz and 1.2 GHz components are. Measuring DM therefore relies on accurately estimating the arrival delay between the high and low frequencies constituting the light and since the delay is of the order of a few seconds. Lorimer et al could not account for the burst’s large DM using estimates of matter density within our galaxy alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was very much this dispersion that led Lorimer et al to postulate they are extragalactic in origin. In fact, it was several times larger and the burst was estimated to have originated at a distance of &amp;lt;1 Gigaparsec (Gpc). The sharp FRB pulse is therefore quite a unique and powerful probe of ionized matter on cosmological scales. Previously available cosmological probes of matter like quasar absorption lines are largely “blind” to ionized matter as fully ionized hydrogen and helium (which makes up most of the universe) do not produce any line features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/frb_sunil/image2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 2: The dispersed pulse of the Lorimer Burst. The dark curve is the FRB event. The horizontal axis shows the time relative to a reference. The higher frequency components of the pulse come before the low frequency components and thus the curve goes from the top-left to bottom-right. The shape of the curve is governed by plasma physics. The inset image shows the pulse when all the frequencies are aligned (i.e. the curve is straightened) and summed over. Note how sharp the pulse is compared to the total time of the FRB event (~0.4 s).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emission or absorption line features are manifestations of the quantum nature of an atom. In the ionized state, i.e. when  atoms are stripped of their electrons, there is no quantum system to produce said features. Furthermore, continuum (i.e. non line-like) emission from electrons/ions in the intergalactic medium is extremely hard to detect due to its sparsity. FRB dispersions on the other hand provide a direct measure of the line-of-sight integrated ionized matter density.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to their transient nature, it is only recently that FRBs have been localized in the sky with a precision better than an arcsecond thanks to advances in radio interferometry. The first FRB to be precisely localized was FRB 20121102 (by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...834L...7T/abstract&quot;&gt;Tendulkar et al&lt;/a&gt; in 2017), which using the American Very Large Array (VLA), was pinpointed to a small, highly star-forming galaxy at a redshift of 0.19. This FRB was first detected by the Arecibo telescope in 2012 and then since the source burst repeatedly albeit sporadically over the years, it was finally captured with the radio interferometer that is the VLA in 2017. In 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Sci...365..565B/abstract&quot;&gt;Bannister et al&lt;/a&gt; detected and simultaneously localized the FRB 20180924 thanks to the Australian Square-Kilometer-Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and a new technique of performing radio interferometry. ASKAP consists of several large radio antenna pointing in the same direction in the sky. The telescope essentially looks for a transient in the non-interferometric mode&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. without correlating the signal from its individual antennae, to maximize the area of the sky scanned. The moment it detects a transient, the data in its buffer gets dumped to an external storage space for post-detection correlation and subsequently localization. Since the first detection, ASKAP has localized several FRBs and will continue doing so. Precise localization is crucial in pegging the FRB’s distance as the pulse itself does not carry precise information about the redshift&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Localization is crucial to identify the host galaxy and spectroscopic follow-up observations of the host yield the redshift or distance estimate&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/frb_sunil/image3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 3: UV image of the FRB 20190608 host galaxy showing the active starforming regions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922..173C/abstract&quot;&gt;Chittidi et al 2020&lt;/a&gt;). The red circle/white rectangle shows the radio-derived location of the FRB which is coincident with one of the starforming clumps.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the dispersion and the distance to the FRBs, one can start constraining the matter distribution in the foreground universe. One FRB sightline that we studied in detail was that of FRB 20190608 (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...901..134S/abstract&quot;&gt;Simha et al 2020&lt;/a&gt;). This FRB was localized to a spiral galaxy at redshift 0.3215 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) footprint. A UV Hubble image of the galaxy showed that the FRB originated from one of the star-forming clumps within a spiral arm (Fig. 3). Due to its fortunate location within the SDSS database, we had extensive spectroscopic information of the field galaxies. This informed us about the location of foreground galaxies relative to the sightline and thus, with some modeling, the contribution of different foreground electron reservoirs to the FRB DM. Being an integrated quantity, the DM can be split into multiple parts corresponding to the source of electrons. That is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
DM&lt;sub&gt;FRB&lt;/sub&gt; = DM&lt;sub&gt;MW&lt;/sub&gt; + DM&lt;sub&gt;halos&lt;/sub&gt; + DM&lt;sub&gt;IGM&lt;/sub&gt; + DM&lt;sub&gt;host&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here DM&lt;sub&gt;MW&lt;/sub&gt; is the contribution from the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM) and halo, DM&lt;sub&gt;host&lt;/sub&gt; is a similar term but for the host galaxy, DM&lt;sub&gt;halos&lt;/sub&gt; is from the gas present in intervening galactic halos and DM&lt;sub&gt;IGM&lt;/sub&gt; is from the diffuse filamentary gas that permeates the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Large-scale_structure&quot;&gt;cosmic web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. In our work, we aimed to estimate each of these individual subcomponents from optical observations. For the Milky Way, we used models of the ISM electron distribution constructed using galactic pulsars (NE2001; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003astro.ph..1598C/abstract&quot;&gt;Cordes and Lazio 2003&lt;/a&gt;). We modeled the gas distribution of the halo as a modified NFW profile (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.485..648P/abstract&quot;&gt;Prochaska and Zheng 2019&lt;/a&gt; for details). In total, of the 340 pc cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;of the FRB DM, we estimated roughly 80 pc cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; arising from the Milky Way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922..173C/abstract&quot;&gt;Chittidi et al 2020&lt;/a&gt; estimated the DM&lt;sub&gt;host&lt;/sub&gt;~100 pc cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_field_spectrograph&quot;&gt;integral field unit&lt;/a&gt; (IFU)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; observations with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) and the same halo model as the one used for the Milky Way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the SDSS and WISE photometry available for the field galaxies in tandem with the spectroscopic redshifts, we estimated the stellar masses of foreground galaxies. Then, using the stellar-to-halo-mass ratio from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.428.3121M/abstract&quot;&gt;Moster et al 2013&lt;/a&gt;, we estimated their halo masses. Assuming that the halo gas typically extends up to one virial radius&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, we determined which halos intersect the FRB sightline and then using our modified NFW halo gas model, determined their DM contributions. We estimated DM&lt;sub&gt;halos&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 20 pc cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimating DM&lt;sub&gt;IGM&lt;/sub&gt; was perhaps the most challenging as one cannot directly observe diffuse filamentary gas, its presence is generally inferred indirectly. However, since we had access to the SDSS galaxy redshifts, we could, in theory, reconstruct the cosmic web density using them as tracers. Thus, we leveraged the Monte-Carlo &lt;i&gt;Physarum Machine&lt;/i&gt; (MCPM) model introduced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...891L..35B/abstract&quot;&gt;Burchett et al&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 to do exactly this. The algorithm is inspired by the motion of Physarum polycephalum or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rWk6h0Syog&quot;&gt;slime mold&lt;/a&gt;. The mold efficiently searches for food particles and produces a filamentary network connecting them in its wake. Modeling the galaxies as “food”, one can produce a steady-state slime mold particle density with MCPM and translate this to physical matter density by calibrating against dark matter density in cosmological simulations. The result (see Fig. 4) is an estimate of gas density along the sightline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/frb_sunil/image4.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 4: Cosmic web density “reconstruction” using the MCPM algorithm for the FRB 20190608 sightline. Though galaxies were cone-searched around the FRB, as it is located in one of the narrow strips of SDSS, there were more spectra available in one direction (top) than the other (side) and thus our model doesn’t appear conical.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this model, we estimated DM&lt;sub&gt;IGM&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 110 pc cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus just using optical data, we were able to estimate DMFRB and closely match the radio measurement. Our model uncertainties are fairly large (~30%) but nevertheless, this work was a proof of concept that FRB DMs can inform us about the matter distribution in the universe. Furthermore, if this analysis is performed on multiple sightlines, we can start laying statistical constraints on some of the key model parameters that were only assumed in this work e.g. the fraction of the universe’s baryons in the filamentary gas and the fraction of halo gas present in the hot (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; K) ionized phase. In fact, our future work on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210900386L/abstract&quot;&gt;FLIMFLAM&lt;/a&gt; (FRB Line-of-sight Ionization Measurement with Lightcone AAOmega Mapping) survey intends to achieve ~ 10% constraints on these parameters using ~25 sightlines. We are currently collecting spectroscopic redshifts of field galaxies along multiple sightlines and hope to start producing preliminary results within the next year. FRB-aided cosmology promises exciting research in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[4] Astronomers use redshift as a proxy for distance when it comes to cosmological scales. This is thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law&quot;&gt;Hubble relation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[5] This is the large-scale structure of matter in the universe. As dark matter (and regular matter) condensed gravitationally after the Big Bang, it created halos and filamentary structures connecting halos, giving it a web-like appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[6] IFUs are specialized instruments that can take images as well as spectra of the field-of-view simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[7] A virial radius of a halo is the radius from its center within which the halo dark matter density is roughly 200 times larger than the background value. Think of it as the radial extent of the halo matter.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Identifying emission-line stars from a large spectroscopic database</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We present a catalog of 3339 hot emission-line stars (ELS) identified from 451,695 O, B, and A type spectra, provided by the LAMOST DR5 release. We developed an automated python routine that identified 5437 spectra having a peak between 6561 and 6568~Å. False detections and bad spectra were removed, leaving 4138 good emission-line spectra of 3339 unique ELS. We re-estimated the spectral type of 3307 spectra as the LAMOST Stellar Parameter Pipeline (LASP) did not provide accurate spectral types for these emission-line spectra. As Herbig Ae/Be stars show higher excess in near-infrared and mid-infrared wavelengths than Classical Ae/Be stars, we used 2MASS and WISE photometry to distinguish them. Finally, we report 1089 Classical Be, 233 Classical Ae, and 56 Herbig Ae/Be stars identified from the LAMOST DR5. In addition, 928 B[em]/A[em] stars and 240 CAe/CBe potential candidates are identified. From our sample of 3339 hot emission-line stars, 2716 ELS identified in this work do not have any record in the SIMBAD database and they can be considered as new detections. Identification of such a large homogeneous set of emission-line spectra will help the community to study the emission phenomenon in detail without worrying about the inherent biases when compiling from various sources.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand what emission line stars (ELS) are, one needs to know about the spectrum of a star. Each star has its own unique spectrum, analogous to the fingerprint of humans. A spectrum can be used to identify the properties of the star such as its temperature, chemical composition and (indirect) physical constraints. So clearly, spectroscopy of cosmic objects can reveal lots of information about the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let us ask a more basic question. What is a spectrum? To understand this, imagine a rainbow on a rainy day. A rainbow is formed when the sunlight passes through the water molecules suspended in the air after the rain. As the sunlight moves through a spherical water droplet, it gets dispersed into various colours ranging from Violet to Red. This is a real-life example of spectroscopy. The light from a stellar object, when passed through a slit or a prism (the optical equivalent of the spherical water droplet), gets split into various colours. If the light from the star is as ideal as white light is, which is made up of all the colors with equal intensity, we would get a beautiful color gradient with all colors shining equally. However, the universe is not that simple. The spectrum of a star will have bright and dark lines, similar to the way we have ridges and valleys in our fingerprint (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/sridharan1_emission_stars_database/image1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Figure 1:  A representative high-resolution spectrum showing the visible light of alpha Boo. The black lines in this spectrum are caused due to various metallic elements present in the photosphere of the cool giant alpha Boo.
Image source:&lt;a hrefsridharan1_emission_stars_database=&quot;https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noao-arct/&quot;&gt;N.A.Sharp, NOIRLab/NSF/AURA)
 &lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These bright and dark lines (or emission and absorption lines) are the most crucial information of the spectrum. They tell us about the atomic and molecular processes going on in the top most layer of the star which is known as the photosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An absorption line is formed in the spectrum when light of a certain wavelength is absorbed by an atom or a molecule. Similarly, an emission line is formed when light of a certain wavelength is emitted (or radiated) by an atom or a molecule. To put it simply, when an atom ‘absorbs’ light, it goes into a higher energy level and when it ‘emits’ light, it comes down to a lower energy level as shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/sridharan1_emission_stars_database/image2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Figure 2: The above plots show the absorption and emission process as caused by the excitation and de-excitation of electrons around the nucleus.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spectrum of a star is the information that gives us the intensity at each wavelength of light. An observed stellar spectrum consists of the blackbody continuum, absorption lines and in some cases, emission lines. The blackbody continuum in the visible and infrared region is due to the thermal emission of the star and the absorption lines are seen because the ‘cooler’ photosphere absorbs light at certain wavelengths. These two components are seen in the spectrum of all the stars because it arises due to the basic structure of stars. Now let us come to the topic of this article, ELS. Emission lines arise from a hot, gaseous region around the star that is formed due to some special nature of the star. The type of stars that show emission lines in their spectrum are called Emission line stars (ELS). You can call them the rebellious group of star families, who want to be unique by showing emission lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various types of ELS known to us today (and its analogues)
Pre-main sequence (PMS) stars - young, naughty teenagers creating chaos
Classical Be stars - people with midlife crisis
Wolf-Rayet stars - old, wise people
Even though ELS comprises stars in various evolutionary phases, in most cases the emission arises from the equatorial circumstellar disc which is made of gas and dust. The formation mechanism of circumstellar disc varies between different classes. For example, in PMS stars the circumstellar disc is the accretion disc through which material is added to the star from its surroundings. In Classical Be stars, the disc is formed due to rapid spinning of the star which pushes away material from the star to its surroundings. So it should be noted that even though we put stars with emission lines into a single category of ELS, they are very different from each other. Hence, we need to classify them based on their photometric properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aim&quot;&gt;Aim:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As large-scale spectroscopic surveys collect a large number of spectra every night, we need to identify special classes of stars such as ELS and classify them into different categories for the research community to study various emission mechanisms. This is the motivation for the work titled “Discovery of 2716 hot emission-line stars from LAMOST DR5’’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data&quot;&gt;Data:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) is a multi-object telescope that can observe around 4000 stars in one night. By its 5th data release (DR5), it had accumulated around 9 million spectra from 2011-2017 which are available to the community. We made use of this huge database to increase the number of ELS stars known to us. One interesting fact about LAMOST is that the majority of  observed stars are in the Galactic anticenter direction. This is particularly important because the earlier studies which have identified ELS have not looked into this direction of the sky. So this opened up an opportunity to study ELS in previously less explored parts of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we took O, B and A type stars (Teff ranging from 30000 K to 10000 K) from the LAMOST DR5 database (for an explanation of different spectral types, look into Anusha R’s CAe article). We restricted ourselves to these spectral types because the main aim of this was to identify new Classical Be/Ae and Herbig Be/Ae stars. Once we removed bad quality (Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) &amp;lt; 10)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; spectra from our list, we used an open-source python package called ‘scipy.signal’ to identify emission peaks. The entire definition of ELS rests on the presence of one of the most commonly found emission line, Hα at 6563 Å. We searched and picked out spectra with the Hα line anywhere between 6561 Å and 6568 Å. This range was selected to take into effect the instrumental calibration defect (if any) and the doppler shift that may be seen in a few stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identified 4138 spectra that belong to 3339 unique ELS stars from our analysis. To classify stars into different categories such as CBeAe or HBeAe, we need an accurate spectral type for each spectrum. The LAMOST automated pipeline does provide a spectral type for each spectrum which did not turn out to be accurate due to the presence of emission lines. This introduced the necessity for us to re-estimate spectral type for each spectrum. We followed a technique called template matching. We made use of the MILES stellar spectral library for this purpose. For each spectrum, we matched the templates from MILES library to our target spectrum and identified the best fit. Then the spectral type of the best fit template was assigned to the target spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to differentiate between Classical Be/Ae and Herbig Be/Ae stars, we made use of the inherent difference between them known as Infrared (IR) excess. Herbig Be/Ae stars, being young stars, have lots of gas and dust around them in addition to a circumstellar disc. This extra gas and dust reprocesses the energy from the star and emits them in infrared wavelengths. Due to this, the HAeBe stars are brighter in IR wavelengths than CBe stars. Hence we use the photometric data&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; available to us to differentiate them based on colors and spectral indices. The breakup of various classes identified in this work is given in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visually examined the Hα line features belonging to each class and reported their statistics. Finally, a representative spectrum of major classes is presented in Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-scope&quot;&gt;Future Scope:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research work identifies new ELS stars from a large database and classifies them into various categories based on their photometric properties. As the data collection capabilities increase day-to-day, the need for such works increases. We have multiple follow-up works in the fray which uses the LAMOST database effectively in identifying and study the properties of CBeAe and HAeBe stars in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bar Buckling and Boxy/Peanut Bulges as the Tracer of Dark Matter Halo Shape</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Galaxies reside in the deep potential of invisible matter called dark matter. Their dynamics is significantly affected by the distribution of dark matter around them. Distribution of dark matter around galaxies is usually known as dark matter halo. Most of the previous studies of galaxies assumed spherical dark matter halos. But, cosmological simulations of structure formation suggest that the dark matter halo can vary in shape. It can also have non-spherical shape (e.g. oblate and prolate) which can significantly influence the evolution of the galaxy. In this study, Astronomer from IIA, Bangalore and SJTU, China have studied the effect of non-spherical dark matter halos on the buckling of the bars and formation of boxy/peanut shape bulges. They perfomed a set of numerical simulation for varying dark matter halo shape and traced the formation of bars and boxy/peanut shape bulges.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the clear night sky, you may find a white bright band stretching from north to south in the sky. It is nothing but our home galaxy, the Milky Way. There are trillions of galaxies in our observable Universe. Galaxies are gravitationally bound systems of stars, gas, dust, and invisible matter called dark matter. Galaxies come in different shapes and sizes ranging from spherical - like a ball to disk - like a round plate. Since most of the disk galaxies have spiral arms, they are also called spiral galaxies. Depending on the presence of a bar, a spiral galaxy could be a barred spiral or unbarred spiral. Disk galaxies usually possess a dense collection of stars in their centres which is termed as the bulge. Bulges can range from nearly spherical to as flat as the disk of galaxies. Our Milky way has a boxy/peanut shape flat bulge which is supposed to have formed from the thickening of the bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/ankit1_bar_buckling_dark_matter/image1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Figure 1: Example of unbarred and barred galaxies.

 &lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The matter we can see in a galaxy is far less than its actual matter content. More than 80% of the total galaxy mass is invisible to us. Only the motion of the stars or gas in the galaxy shows the presence of dark matter. This invisible matter is commonly referred to as dark matter. Due to the presence of an enormous amount of dark matter in the galaxy, the dynamics of the stars is remarkably affected by the distribution of the dark matter. In the past, there have been several detailed studies of the galaxies assuming the spherical distribution of dark matter in the galaxies. There are very limited works that consider the non-spherical distribution of dark matter for the study of galaxies. In the present paper, Ankit Kumar and the team have investigated the effect of non-spherical dark matter distribution on the bar buckling and the formation of boxy/peanut flat bulge like that seen in our Galaxy. Bar buckling is a bar thickening mechanism where the bar suddenly bends out of the disk of the galaxy. Bar buckling can be simply understood using a practical example of a beam or pillar. Say, there is a vertically standing beam and you start increasing the load on it. Then at some point, it will suddenly bend somewhere in the middle (or may collapse). This sudden change is called the buckling of the beam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authors have used the supercomputing facility to generate mock realistic disk galaxies and to evolve them in time. The distribution of dark matter in the galaxies ranges from oblate to prolate including spherical one. Oblate distribution (or oblate halo) looks like the shape formed on squeezing a sphere from its top and bottom whereas prolate distribution (or prolate halo) is similar to the shape formed on stretching a sphere from its top and bottom. To trace the formation and evolution of the bar and buckling events, they used Fourier analysis and found that the galaxies in prolate halos form bar earlier than the galaxies in oblate halos. Also, the bar in prolate halos buckles before the bar in the oblate halos. Fourier analysis is the method to decompose any general function or structure into simple trigonometric functions or structures with definite frequencies (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series&quot;&gt; this article  &lt;/a&gt; for Fourier series).
Buckling events are very rarely observed. To date, there are only 8 confirmed galaxies that are currently going through the buckling events. In this study, Ankit Kumar and the team found three distinct buckling events for the bar in the prolate halo. It is the first time where more than two buckling events in a bar have been detected in any study. The total duration of buckling is longer for the bar in the prolate halo. The rarity of buckling in observations and longer duration buckling in the prolate halos lead authors to conclude that most of the dark matter halos could be oblate and spherical in shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/ankit1_bar_buckling_dark_matter/image3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; A clear buckling of the iso-density contour can be seen in the outer bar of the prolate halo during the 3rd buckling event. It also shows the formation and growth of peanut shape bulge after bar buckling.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each buckling event makes the bar thick in size. First buckling thickens the innermost region of the bar while the succeeding bucklings thicken the outer regions of the bar. As a result of these thickening boxy/peanut shape flat bulge forms. Since the bar in the prolate halo shows more buckling events as compared to the oblate halo, the bar in prolate halo thickens the most and forms the most thicker boxy/peanut shape bulge.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Measuring the age of the Universe: An overview</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A popular article exploring how the age of the Universe was calculated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmicvarta.in/measuring-the-age-sun-moon-gourav&quot;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt; has already provided a flavour of how scientists use mathematics combined with knowledge obtained from physics to reveal numerous hidden secrets of nature such as the age of the Earth, the Moon and even the Solar System. But the story does not end here. It literally cannot. This is because the curiosity of human beings is unquenchable. Naturally, any curious mind will ask the next question, what is the age of the universe? Fortunately, the power of human intellect combined with the supreme efficiency of mathematics and physics have provided an answer to this almost impossible to solve question also. We now know with reasonable confidence that our universe is around 13.8 billion (i.e. 1380 crore since 1 billion = 100 crore) years old. But, how do we measure the age of the universe? To know the answer, one has to study ‘cosmology’. This might be one of the most thrilling detective stories of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cosmology is the study of the size, structure and evolution of the universe — in other words, the &lt;em&gt;geography&lt;/em&gt; of the universe as a single system. In cosmology, our subject is the whole universe, defined as all matter and energy in existence anywhere, observable or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;birth-of-cosmology&quot;&gt;Birth of cosmology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most fundamental questions of humanity is the question of origins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Where did we come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question runs deeper than the origins of any one person and delves into questions of where did life, our planet, and the entire universe come from. Many cultures have avoided the notion of an origin to the universe by placing their creation stories in a cycle. Buddhist and Hindu origins stories measure the birth, death, and rebirth of the universe in units of 4 trillion years, which is a day in the life of Brahma. At night, all matter is absorbed into the spirit of the sleeping Brahma. At dawn, when Brahma awakes, matter reappears and the cycle continues. The Greek Stoics saw the universe as being created from fire, only to be destroyed by fire, and so on. Cosmological cycles are also found in the cultures of the Maya and the Aztec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of modern cosmology began with Albert Einstein and Edwin Hubble. From Einstein’s theories, the shape of space is described as being warped by gravity. From the observations of Hubble, we learned the universe is expanding. Together these two men described the evolving shape of space and they opened up a new field of science called cosmology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-big-bang-model&quot;&gt;The Big Bang model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern theory of the origin of the universe starts with the idea of expanding space. Georges Lemaître was a priest and a mathematician, an unassuming man who had beaten the giants of physics to the punch in deducing that the universe could be expanding. In 1929, Lemaître was the first to hypothesize a revolutionary idea: at one time, the universe might have been as small as an atomic nucleus. He proposed that the universe derived from a cosmic singularity, &lt;em&gt;a day without a yesterday&lt;/em&gt; when the universe was infinitely small and infinitely curved, and all matter and energy were concentrated in a single point. Many astrophysicists found the idea bizarre and distasteful and English theorist Fred Hoyle disparaged the idea with the name &lt;em&gt;big bang&lt;/em&gt;. The label stuck, and scientists continue to call the description of the creation of the universe the Big Bang model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Figure 1: According to the Big Bang model, the universe expanded from an extremely dense and hot state and continues to expand today

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Bang model forces us to consider the idea of cosmic evolution. The universal recession of galaxies implies that the universe is evolving, and it has not always been in the same state. Our observations of nearby galaxies represent a single frame in a movie that has been playing for billions of years. We can wind the tape backwards, seeing snapshots of a progressively older universe, by observing sets of galaxies at progressively larger distances, and thus at progressively larger look back times. (Since light takes time to travel, we see objects far away as they looked when the light was released rather than as they are now.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we look back into the early universe, we can see the galaxies move closer together. Observationally, we can’t see all the way back to the first moments, but we can see times when galaxies were just forming, and the large scale structures — the cosmic walls and voids — were just starting to form. If we could look further back, we’d see that as the universe gets smaller; its volume contracts until all the mass are smashed together in a tiny universe. The mass that formed galaxies and stars breaks down into a seething hot gas, as the universe tends toward a state of infinite temperature and density. Thinking of the Big Bang as an explosion is tempting, but it is also misleading. In an explosion on Earth, debris flies through space. In the Big Bang, the initial singularity contains all space and matter. Time itself begins with the big bang. The evolution of the universe is the unfolding of time and space from a condition of incredible heat and density to cold and enormous state billions of years later. This bang had no center, it had no past and it simply was the sudden beginning of everything in an expanding geometry that may or may not be finite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientific story of creation says that everything — you and the Earth and the Sun and the Milky Way and all the billions of galaxies — emerged from a tiny dense dot of energy and matter that unfolded into the universe we see now. It sounds as fantastic as any of the creation myths of older cultures. How do we know that the big bang actually occurred? There are three primary pieces of evidence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Galaxies are taking part in a universal expansion as indicated by the linear relation between distance and redshift (the Hubble relation).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The abundance of the lightest elements can be explained by fusion in the universe when it was young and dense and hot (cosmic nucleosynthesis).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Space is filled with the radiation from the early hot phase, now diluted and reduced in energy to the level of microwaves (the cosmic microwave background).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describing each of these concepts is beyond the scope of this article. But the Hubble relation mentioned in the first point bears huge importance in measuring the age of the universe. Hence, I shall take the opportunity to discuss in brief the Hubble relation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hubble-relation-or-hubbles-law&quot;&gt;Hubble relation or Hubble’s law&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hubble relation, popularly known as the Hubble’s law or Hubble–Lemaître law is considered the first observational basis for the expansion of the universe and today serves as one of the pieces of evidence most often cited in support of the Big Bang model. Although widely attributed to Edwin Hubble, the notion of the universe expanding at a calculable rate was first derived from the general relativity equations in 1922 by Alexander Friedmann. Friedmann published a set of equations, now known as the Friedmann equations, showing that the universe might expand, and presenting the expansion speed if this was the case. Then Georges Lemaître, in a 1927 article, independently derived that the universe might be expanding, observed the proportionality between the recessional velocity of and distance to distant bodies and suggested an estimated value of the proportionality constant, which when corrected by Hubble became known as the Hubble constant. Then in 1929, Edwin Hubble confirmed the existence of cosmic expansion and determined a more accurate value for the constant that now bears his name. Hubble inferred the recession velocity of the objects from their redshifts, many of which were earlier measured and related to velocity by Vesto Slipher in 1917.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law is often expressed by the equation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;v = H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;D   (1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where, v is the recessional velocity, typically expressed in km/s.
H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is Hubble’s constant and corresponds to the value of H (often termed the Hubble parameter which is a value that is time-dependent and which can be expressed in terms of the scale factor) in the Friedmann equations taken at the time of observation denoted by the subscript 0. This value is the same throughout the universe for a given comoving time.
D is the proper distance (which can change over time, unlike the comoving distance, which is constant) from the galaxy to the observer, measured in megaparsecs (Mpc), in the 3-space defined by given cosmological time.
The reciprocal of H0 is the Hubble time. This constant term H0 help us to estimate the age of the universe. Let me now discuss in brief how it does so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;age-of-the-universe&quot;&gt;Age of the Universe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Einstein, Lemaitre, and others solved the equations of general relativity, they were able to describe how the size of the universe has changed with time. Astronomers use the symbol R to represent the scale or size of the universe at any time. You can think of R as the size of the universe, but more accurately it represents the distance between any two well-separated places. The cosmological principle says that any two points are moving apart at the same rate. Thus, the entire history of the universe is described by the way that R varies with time. Since the universe is expanding, R has been continuously increasing for billions of years. Remember that R describes the expansion of space that carries galaxies apart — the galaxies themselves are not expanding. Galaxies are just markers of expanding space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Bang model even provides a prediction for the age of the universe. If we imagine the evolving universe as a movie, the birth of the universe is the time in the distant past when all matter and radiation was crushed in a state of infinite temperature and density. The scale factor, R, was zero. Space had not yet begun to unfold. There are three ways to constrain the age of the universe. But in many ways, looking at the expansion rate of the universe is one of the easiest ways to figure out the universe’s age. This technique looks at the current expansion rate and then running it backwards to determine when today’s universe must have been compressed down to a single point. Mathematically, the age of the universe is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 / H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;f (Ωr Ωm Ωλ;…)    (2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the current age, H0 is the current expansion rate, and f is a correction that takes into consideration the mass, energy, and other characteristics of the universe. For this method to work, you need to not only know the current expansion rate but also how this rate has changed over time due to the effects of gravity and the effect of dark energy (Ωλ;), which is pushing the universe apart. The best published value for the expansion rate is H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=70.6 ± 3.1 (km/sec) / Mpc. This means that every Megaparsec of space expands roughly 70.6 km each second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on stellar evolution models, we estimate the oldest globular star clusters are between 11 and 13 billion years old. Apart from these two techniques, the most trusted means of determining the age of the universe comes from very precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The CMB is a diffuse, uniform background of microwave radiation that comes from all directions in the sky. This CMB is the electromagnetic radiation which is the remnant from an early stage of the universe, also known as &lt;em&gt;relic radiation&lt;/em&gt;. First observed accidentally by the radio engineers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson in 1965, CMB is a crucial piece of evidence that supports the big bang model for the origin of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three space missions, in particular, have been instrumental in measuring this radiation in finer and finer detail and with better and better precision. NASA’s Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) took data from 1989 to 1996 and it was the first to detect tiny variations in the intensity of the radiation. Next came the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), launched by NASA in 2001. WMAP took data for a decade and its very accurate measurements put constraints on a set of parameters of the big bang model. The current state-of-the-art experiment is ESA’s Planck mission, launched in 2009. The level of accuracy of Planck data is tens of thousands of times greater than the discovery measurements of Penzias and Wilson. Based on the WMAP measurements and theoretical models, the universe is estimated to be 13.82 ± 0.12 billion years old. This is the most quoted age used by astronomers and is consistent with both other measurements within their errors. Remarkably, you can see that this value is very close to what has been estimated using the Hubble constant in equation 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very early in the history of mankind, ignorance of nature and fear of the unknown naturally made men religious. So God played a central role in primitive societies. They tried to answer every question with the help of God. As time passed, with experience and intellect men could understand more and more of the natural phenomenon. I have mentioned in my previous article that if one looks at the long march of human understanding, one will find that science begins with the idea that we can understand our role in the universe using logic and observation. Today humans have come a long way. And mathematics has truly acted as the most essential weapon in almost every known field, including astronomy. By now any reader will understand that in these two articles, I’ve discussed in brief how mathematics in simple form also has helped in the development of astronomy and human knowledge as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Futuristic gravitational wave observations to resolve dichotomy of compact objects</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Gravitational waves are invisible ripples in space travel at the speed of light. It is generated in different scenarios, such as when two celestial bodies orbit around each other, an isolated body with tri-axial symmetry spins, inhomogeneity in matter distribution in the early universe, etc. Gravitational-wave astronomy aims to study these waves to improve the understanding of objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, events such as supernovae, and processes including those of the early universe shortly after the Big Bang. The article describes how futuristic gravitational wave observatories can be used to resolve the dichotomy of compact objects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, astronomy primarily relies on electromagnetic radiation. Over the past hundred years, various interesting astronomical objects have been discovered with gamma-ray detectors to radio telescopes. In recent years, gravitational wave astronomy has opened a new window to probe various exciting objects, and we can now look into the universe from a very different perspective. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO&quot;&gt;LIGO&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_interferometer&quot;&gt;Virgo&lt;/a&gt; gravitational wave detectors have so far made tens of detections from the merger of various compact objects. These are ground-based detectors operating at frequencies more than 1  Hz. As time progresses, these detectors have been upgraded continuously to increase their sensitivities so that we can look objects residing at further distances. Moreover, around 2035, a space-based gravitational wave mission, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elisascience.org&quot;&gt;LISA&lt;/a&gt; is planned to launch, which would operate at less than 1 Hz frequency. Many interesting objects such as galactic binaries, massive binaries, extreme mass ratio inspirals, etc., emit gravitational radiation at less than 1 Hz frequencies. Hence the current ground-based detectors cannot detect these objects, and LISA is planned to probe them. It is important to note that none of these objects are isolated in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, a group of researchers have claimed that LISA might detect some isolated compact objects too. The term compact objects primarily represent white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. White dwarfs are the end state of stars with mass less than &lt;math&gt; (10
&amp;#177;2) M&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, where M&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; ~2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; kg is the mass of the sun, in which the hydrogen fusion has stopped. One such object is the super-Chandrasekhar white dwarf. Over the past couple of decades, various researchers have detected more than a dozen over-luminous &lt;a href=&quot;http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Astro/snovcn.html&quot;&gt;type Ia supernovae&lt;/a&gt;. Based on these observations, they have inferred that these supernovae have to be originated from massive white dwarfs, which violate the standard Chandrasekhar mass limit of 1.4 M&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, these objects are often termed as super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs. It has been shown that if a white dwarf possesses strong magnetic fields at the center, such white dwarfs can indeed hold mass more than 1.4  M&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, if such a white dwarf rotates in such a way that there is a misalignment between its magnetic and rotation axes, it can emit continuous gravitational waves. These researchers have explicitly shown that if a white dwarf has a strong central field but a weaker field at its surface, LISA can detect it within 1 year of detection period. On the other hand, if the white dwarf possesses a strong surface field or a weak central field, LISA will not be able to detect it. However, such white dwarfs can be detected by some other futuristic detectors, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20100526050722/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/37836/1/05-2157.pdf&quot;&gt;BBO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tamago.mtk.nao.ac.jp/spacetime/decigo_e.html&quot;&gt;DECIGO&lt;/a&gt;, etc. In this way, LISA can directly confirm the existence of super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs (Fig. 1). Note that signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is proportional to the square root of observation time (T) such that S/N increases with the observation time and the signal is more likely to be detected (see Section 1.4 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Univ....5..217S/abstract&quot;&gt;Sieniawska &amp;amp; Bejger, 2019, Universe 5, 217&lt;/a&gt;). This likeliness of detection is due to the increase in observation period and not due to the increase in sensitivity of the detectors. If S/N &amp;GreaterEqual; 5, such a signal can be detected by a gravitational wave detector (see Section~2.1 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/415/2/1849/1044522?login=true&quot;&gt;Pitkin, 2011, MNRAS, 415, 1849&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Figure 1: Gravitational wave S/N as a function of integration time for a white dwarf with central density= 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. The thick orange line corresponds to &amp;lt;S/N&amp;gt; ≈ 5.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gravitational wave astronomy is also helpful to resolve the dichotomy of some other objects too. There are some isolated compact objects, named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~pulsar/magnetar/main.html&quot;&gt;soft gamma repeater~(SGR) and anomalous X-ray pulsar~(AXP)&lt;/a&gt;, which are mostly believed to be neutron stars as they are found to be associated with supernova remnants. However, some of them do not have a supernova remnant association, and their magnetic field is also unknown. Hence, some researchers have also shown that some of their features can be explained assuming they are white dwarfs. To resolve this controversy, the researchers have shown that gravitational wave astronomy is also a helpful tool. It was shown that if they are neutron stars, no proposed gravitational wave detector can detect them. On the other hand, if they are white dwarfs, they can be detected by BBO and DECIGO detectors within 1 year of detection period. The exact time needed for the detection is dependent on the magnetic field configuration and its strength (Fig. 2).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Magnetic Field Measurements of the Solar Corona by Aditya L1</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the science goals of the Aditya L1 is to map the coronal magnetic field topology. The infrared channel of the VELC payload of the Aditya L1 is equipped with a spectropolarimeter to perform full stokes spectropolarimetric observations in the Fe XIII 1074.7 nm line to measure the vector magnetic field. This article discusses the design and the working of the spectropolarimeter of the VELC. This article also discusses the challenges associated with the spectropolarimeter of the VELC, which are to optimize the data volume to be sent to the ground as no onboard data processing is planned, and the other is to account for the change in polarimeter characteristic due to mismatch in retarder rotation frequency and the length of signal detection time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isro.gov.in/aditya-l1-first-indian-mission-to-study-sun&quot;&gt;Aditya L1&lt;/a&gt; is the first Indian space-based Solar observatory that will continuously observe the Sun to study coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, coronal magnetometry, origin, and monitoring of near-UV solar radiation. It is equipped with seven payloads. One of the payloads is Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC), developed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iiap.res.in/&quot;&gt;Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA)&lt;/a&gt; to study the diagnostic parameters of solar corona and dynamics and origin of Coronal Mass Ejections and magnetic field measurement of the solar corona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coronagraph is a telescopic instrument that blocks the light of a star so that the nearby objects which would otherwise be hidden in the star’s glare be resolved. A solar coronagraph occults the bright solar disc to resolve the corona. The VELC is equipped with a spectrograph as a backend instrument. A spectrograph disperses the polychromatic light and records the intensities over a range of wavelengths called the spectrum. We study the properties of the spectrum to estimate the plasma parameters like velocity, electron density, temperature, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Figure 1: A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Angle_and_Spectrometric_Coronagraph&quot;&gt;LASCO&lt;/a&gt; C2 Coronagraph. LASCO consists of three coronagraphs (C1/C2/C3) onboard NASA’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory satellite.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VELC is designed to record spectra simultaneously in three spectral lines at 530.3 nm due to Fe XIV (green channel), 789.2 nm due to Fe XI (red channel), and 1074.7 nm due to Fe XIII (IR channel). It is a multi-slit spectrograph (4 equispaced slits) covering the FOV up to 1.5R⊙, where R⊙ is the radius of the Sun. The IR channel is equipped with a polarimeter to carry out full Stokes polarimetric observations of the Fe XIII line. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)&quot;&gt;polarisation&lt;/a&gt; of electromagnetic waves refers to the path or the locus of the electric field vector. If the electric field oscillates in a single direction, it is called linear polarisation. If the electric field rotates in a circular plane as the light travels forward, it is called circular polarisation. The plasma’s magnetic field information is encoded in the polarisation of the spectral lines via the Zeeman effect and the Hanle effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/zeeman.html&quot;&gt;Zeeman effect&lt;/a&gt; is the splitting of the spectral line in the presence of an external magnetic field. The Zeeman splitting of the spectral line gives rise to three spectral components, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sun.stanford.edu/~sasha/PHYS780/SOLAR_PHYSICS/L5/Lecture_05_PHYS780.pdf&quot;&gt;𝞼+, 𝞼-, and 𝜋 components&lt;/a&gt;, which are right circularly polarised, left circularly polarised, and linearly polarised, respectively. If the magnetic field is along the line of sight, in that case, only the 𝞼+, 𝞼- components are observed. If the magnetic field is perpendicular to the line of sight (LOS), all three components are observed as linearly polarised. Also, the separation between these components, an observable quantity, is directly related to the magnitude of the magnetic field. Hence by measuring the polarisation in spectral lines, we can estimate both the magnitude and the direction of the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/coronal_magnetic_field_measurement_velc_aditya_l1_harsh_images/image2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; Figure 2: Subfigure (a) shows the break in the degeneracy between magnetic sublevels in the presence of an external magnetic field, and this break or split of the levels produces three spectral components (𝞼+, 𝞼-, and 𝜋). In subfigure (b), we see if the magnetic field is perpendicular to LOS, then 𝞼+, 𝞼-, and 𝜋 components are observed as linearly polarized. In the subfigure (c), the magnetic field direction is into the plane of the screen (i.e., along the line of sight), therefore only 𝞼+, 𝞼- components are observed as right and left circularly polarized respectively.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hanle effect is observed when the splitting or separation between energy levels of a spectral line, in the presence of an external magnetic field, is less than or equal to the natural width of that line. The anisotropic radiation coming from the underlying photosphere or chromosphere gets scattered by the atoms in the upper layers like the transition region and corona (TR-corona). This scattering process leads to linear polarization of the emitted spectral lines. This is valid even when there is no external magnetic field. Now, in the weak magnetic field regions such as TR-corona (where expected field strength is 1 to 300 Gauss), there will be a modification of the scattering or linear polarization as well as rotation of the plane of linear polarization of the emitted lines. This effect of modification in the line polarization is called the Hanle effect. By measuring this change in the polarization of the lines, the weak magnetic field can be estimated in the TR-corona of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described above, we can estimate the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere by measuring the polarization in spectral lines. A polarimeter is an instrument used to measure polarization. A polarimeter consists of a polarization modulator and a linear polarizer/analyzer. First, the unpolarized light from the Sun enters the polarization modulator which changes the state of input polarization. Then the polarized light from the modulator enters the linear polarizer which cuts the intensity of light perpendicular to its orientation. Hence, we measure at the detector the intensity allowed by the linear polarizer, which in turn depends on the output from the polarization modulator, which in turn depends on the polarization state of the input light of the Sun. By measuring at the detector the output intensity of the incident light of the Sun through the polarimeter and knowing the characteristics of the polarimeter, we can estimate the input polarization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VELC polarimeter consists of a continuously rotating wave plate (RWP) followed by a polarizing beam displacer (PBD) as the polarization analyzer. The PBD produces two beams that are orthogonally polarized, which are simultaneously recorded by the detector. This setup is commonly known as a dual-beam polarimeter. The main advantage of dual-beam setup is to reduce the spurious polarisation, i.e., cross-talk from Stokes I to Q, U, and V. The light enters the polarimeter setup (RWP + PBD), and a frame is recorded on the detector. Then RWP is rotated by an angle, and another frame is recorded. To measure the four Stokes parameters (I, Q, U, and V), a minimum of 4 such measurements, called samples, are required at different orientations of RWP. This is called modulation of the polarization state of light. One modulation cycle constitutes 4 samples per half rotation of the wave plate, so one complete rotation of the RWP provides 2 modulation cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the limited number of photons in the solar corona, large integration times are required to build the required signal-to-noise ratio. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio&quot;&gt;Signal to noise ratio&lt;/a&gt; (SNR) is the ratio of the desired signal strength to the background noise level. When SNR is low, we need to add the signal for many time intervals (integration time), which adds up the signal and reduces or cancels the noise as the noise is assumed random. It poses several challenges concerning the polarimeter of the VELC. One of them is the increased data volume to be sent to the ground station as no on-board data processing is planned. The second is the change in the polarimeter characteristic. In typical polarimeters, first RWP rotates, then the detector frame is recorded, However, in the case of VELC, the RWP rotates, and the detector records independently of each other. There is a mismatch between the retarder’s rotation frequency and the length of the signal detection time, which causes a change in the characteristic of the polarimeter after one cycle of measurements. Nagaraju and the team discuss the above problems and suggest a potential solution to optimize the data volume and account for the change in polarimeter characteristics in successive modulation cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To optimize the data volume, Nagaraju and the team discuss the optimal efficiencies of measuring Stokes parameters as a function of the number of samples per half rotation (n) of the wave plate (RWP) and provide efficiencies when the retarder’s rotation frequency does not match the signal detection time. They find that efficiency slowly increases with an increase in the number of samples per half rotation of the wave plate. They find that the increase in efficiency of measuring Stokes I and Stokes U is close to 10% for the case of n=5 to n=95, for Stokes Q, it is about 8%, and for Stokes V, it is about 4%. However, as the number of samples per half rotation will increase from n=5 to n=95, the data size will proportionally increase, and this will offset any gains in efficiency. They estimate the data size of 3.14 Mb per second for n=4 to 74.19 Mb per second for n=95. Hence they suggest that the number of modulation steps or the samples per half rotation be chosen by considering the data volume and other measurement aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagaraju and the team discuss the change in the elements of polarimeter characteristics with time to understand the effect of the mismatch between retarder rotation frequency and signal detection time. They model this change for the different number of samples per half rotation of the wave plate. They find a cyclical/periodic variation in the elements with time. They find that the larger the time difference between the retarder rotation frequency and signal detection time, the faster is the variation in the elements of polarimeter characteristics with time. Despite the significant variation in individual elements, the efficiency of measuring Stokes parameters does not change significantly throughout integration time. They suggest this change in the elements of the polarimeter characteristics can be taken into account through calibration. They notice that the elements corresponding to measuring Stokes Q and Stokes U vary two times faster than elements corresponding to measuring Stokes V. Hence, recording the calibration data to cover one entire cycle within which elements of polarimeter characteristics corresponding to measuring Stokes V complete one period of variation may suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, they find that the data volume can be optimized by choosing an appropriate number of samples per half rotation of the wave plate (RWP) without significantly affecting the efficiency of the Stokes parameters. The variation of elements of polarimeter characteristic with time is also addressed due to a mismatch between the retarder rotation frequency and signal detection time, and a potential solution is suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Deciphering The Mysteries of The Quiet Sun Explosions</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;XSM onboard Chandrayaan 2 observed the Sun during its minimum activity period in 2019-2020. Using this data, the researchers have for the first time detected a very large number of small scale explosions, called microflares, happening on the Sun. The physical parameters of the microflares have been calculated and their spatial location is also detected using various satellites. The study also gives evidence that such small scale heating events occur everywhere on the Sun and they contribute to coronal heating.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outer atmosphere (the corona) of the Sun poses a long standing mystery regarding its temperature. The solar corona is composed of plasma (ionised gas) that emits strongly in X-rays and ultraviolet radiation. Its temperature exceeds a million degree kelvin, while the visible surface (the photosphere) is at 6000K. One of the theories to understand the so-called ‘coronal heating problem’ proposes the occurrence of a large number of small scale explosions (known as microflares and nanoflares) on the Sun. It is known that these flares are a manifestation of the magnetic field of the Sun that is generated in its interior. But the Sun’s magnetic field is not constant, it varies with an average period of 11 years, which is known as the solar cycle. Approximately every 11 years, the Sun’s magnetic field reverses. In other words, the north pole becomes the south pole, and vice versa. The flip of the poles is an end product of the slow evolution of Sun’s magnetic field over time. As the cycle progresses, all of the Sun’s activities related to its magnetic field (such as sunspots, flares, coronal mass ejections) builds to a maximum (when the magnetic field reverses). Then the Sun settles back down to a minimum, before the whole cycle starts again. The Sun was in a very low state of activity during the minima of solar cycle 24 covering the year 2019. It was in fact the quietest the Sun has been in the last 100 years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this quiet period of the Sun, at the mid of the year 2019, Chandrayaan 2 was launched with the several instruments/payloads to observed our moon and the Sun. Among them CLASS is an instrument to understand the abundance of elements present on the moon. But this requires knowledge of the X-rays emitted from the Sun. Thus, the orbiter also carried an instrument called Solar X-ray  Monitor (XSM). XSM observed the Sun during its deepest minima of solar cycle 24, covering the year 2019-2020 with a good temporal and energy resolution. Using observations during this time, Santosh Vadawale and his team has uncovered some fascinating information about the quiescent Sun. They have shown that during this period small scale transients, so-called microflares (smaller counterpart of the conventional solar flares) are occurring everywhere on the solar disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solar flares are eruptions of electromagnetic radiation of all wavelengths from the Sun. They last from a few minutes to a few hours. Flares are classified depending on the energy they release during its peak in the soft X rays. Though the number of large flares increase with the progress of the solar cycle, this study suggested that small flares, called microflares, keep exploding on the Sun at all times. Though the definition of microflares has varied though the years due to the sensitivity of the instrument, in this study flares having a peak flux below 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt; W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are considered as microflares. During this period of extremely quiet solar corona when no active regions were present on the disk, Santosh Vadawale and team identified a total of 98 microflares from 76 days. The microflares are marked in the lightcurve (Figure 1). Most of the microflares were seen to behave similar to larger flares having a fast rise and a slow decay. Some microflares did not follow this behaviour possibly due to blending of multiple microflares or they intrinsically have a different origin. The temperature and emission measure of these microflares are determined. Temperature tells how hot the plasma gets during the explosion while the emission measure gives an idea about the density of plasma emitted at that particular temperature. The temperature is found to be between 3-6 MK and the emission measure is in the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The XSM microflare locations are identified in the extreme ultraviolet images obtained from NASA’s ‘Solar Dynamics Observatory’ and from the X-ray images obtained by the Japanese HINODE X-ray Telescope. Most microflares were seen to be associated with X-ray Bright Points. ‘Solar Dynamics Observatory’ HMI magnetograms were used to analyse the corresponding photospheric magnetic field. They observed the microflares to be associated with magnetic bipolar regions having  weaker field strengths, which indicates magnetic reconnection happening at smaller scales (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also the first statistical survey of X-ray microflares outside active regions. By plotting the frequency distribution of microflares, the team has given evidence for the hypothesis that small scale heating events occur everywhere on the Sun and they contribute to coronal heating.&lt;/p&gt;
