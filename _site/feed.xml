        <title>Fantastic beasts and where to find them: the elusive nature of X-ray quiet black holes</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With the gravitational wave observations capturing the coalescence of compact objects, hunting for black holes has taken quite a front-row seat in astronomical observations. Here, we discuss two such detection of black holes in orbit with a main sequence companion, and why it is very difficult to find them in the forest of massive stars.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massive stars are objects that are more massive than eight times the mass of our Sun (M⊙). They play an essential role in the evolution of our Universe. They enrich the void between stars with matter via strong winds and provide mechanical feedback. However, many aspects of massive star evolution are still unconstrained, such as their wind mass-loss rates, the mixing efficiency inside their surface, and their death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massive stars that are heavier than ~20 M⊙ are thought to collapse directly to form black holes. Expectantly, there are many uncertainties such as the mass range for black hole formation, the natal kick imparted during the black hole formation due to asymmetric collapse,
and the spin of the resultant black hole. The gravitational wave detectors have already observed ~90 compact object merger events involving black holes and neutron stars. However, more than a million black holes are predicted to be present in our Galaxy itself, waiting to be discovered. So, observationally detecting a large sample of black holes can shed necessary light on their formation properties and their subsequent evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empirically, massive stars have been observed to exist in binaries and higher order multiples, with about three out of every 100 massive star binary above 10M⊙ expected to harbour a black hole as its companion. However, a large fraction of these binaries that will eventually form double compact object binaries will not merge within the current age of our Universe. Hence, they will remain unobservable in the current gravitational wave surveys. Nevertheless, progress can be made to discover these black holes while they are in orbit with a massive star companion, where they are detectable via alternative methods. This is possible, for example, by measuring the X-ray emission from the accretion disk of the black hole, the radial velocity variations in the spectral lines&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of the massive main sequence companion, and through periodic astrometric variations&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or photometric variability&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of the massive star companion induced by the black hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black holes in binaries are thought to form from the collapse of massive Wolf-Rayet stars, which are very hot and bright stars that show emission lines in their spectrum. Now, there are many observed Wolf-Rayet+O star binaries in our Galaxy (~80) compared to observed black hole+O star binaries (only one, Cyg X-1). To resolve this disparity, it was recently suggested that black holes receive a significant natal kick when the Wolf-Rayet stars collapse to form a black hole, disrupting the binary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since black holes do not emit any light of their own, we need to rely on the indirect ways discussed above to observe a black hole. The most common method has been to detect X-rays from the accretion disk around the black hole in a binary with the O star companion. Some of the wind matter from the companion gets attracted by the gravity of the black hole, and if that matter falling into it has enough angular momentum, it can form a disk before being engulfed by the black hole. The matter then swirls around the black hole multiple times, gets heated up to millions of degrees, and gets hot enough to emit X-rays. Bondi, Hoyle and Lyttleton did pioneering work in this field in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we find that such wind accretion in our black hole+O star binary models is not expected to lead to observable X-ray emission. Only in exceptionally favourable cases, such as high angular momentum accretion efficiency and low wind velocities, can an accretion disk form, leading to observable X-ray emission. Moreover, the formation of an accretion disk is also biased towards binaries containing rapidly spinning black holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first-born black hole in a massive binary is expected to be slowly spinning due to efficient angular momentum transport inside a star. The wind velocity of O stars is very high (~2000 km/s), empirically verified through observations. Detailed hydrodynamic calculations predict only one-third of the angular momentum available is accreted by the black hole. Hence, most black holes in orbit with an O star are not expected to form an accretion disk and remain unobservant via X-ray telescopes. So, the discrepancy in the number of observed Wolf-Rayet+O star binaries in comparison to black hole+O star binaries may be due to the lack of observability of the black hole binaries in X-rays. We conclude that high black hole natal kicks are not necessary to explain the scarcity of observed high-mass X-ray binaries. Instead, searching for black holes via alternative methods may be more fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One alternative would be to search for black holes in our Milky Way via astrometric variations in visible stars - that is, variations in the precise measurements of the position of stars in the sky. This method has been shown to be very promising as our Milky Way is expected to harbour millions of black holes in orbit with main sequence companions whose astrometry can be carried out in principle by the GAIA telescope. Unfortunately, the GAIA Data Release 3 did not have the relevant data for stars massive enough to host black holes, and hence this method could not be pursued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus in this work, we look at radial velocity variations of observed massive stars. We have a nearly complete census of the massive star content in the Tarantula nebula of Large Magellanic Cloud, which enables us to also carry out precise number statistics for the massive stars in this region. In fact, it is the most active star-forming region known in the Local Group of galaxies containing very massive stars with a metallicity resembling the peak of star formation in our Universe. The radial velocity of stars is measured by observing the Doppler shift in a prominent spectral line of the star. As the star moves around in one full orbit, the spectral lines are blue-shifted for half of the orbit and red-shifted for the remaining orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we see a Doppler shift in a spectral line of a stellar object both towards the bluer and redder wavelengths simultaneously, we identify the object as a double-lined spectroscopic binary. This is because both the components of the binary are responsible for creating the Doppler shifts in opposite directions, one moving towards us in orbit and the other away from us. When we see a Doppler shift in only one direction, we identify the object as a single-lined spectroscopic binary. This is because the companion star is usually too faint for its spectral line to be detected. Or, in the most interesting case, the companion is a compact object which does not emit any light of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identify the single-lined spectroscopic binaries in the sample of massive stars observed in the Tarantula region. The VLT Flames Tarantula Survey observed approximately 800 massive stars, out of which 300 were O-type stars. From these, around 100 targets that showed radial velocity variations were followed up in the Tarantula Massive Binary Monitoring Survey. Of these, 51 of them were categorised as single-lined spectroscopic binaries. Through follow-up spectral disentangling, we retrieved hidden spectra in 43 of these targets. For the remaining targets where we were not able to find a non-degenerate companion, three of them had an estimated minimum mass of the unseen companion above 4M⊙.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the above, we were able to find unambiguous evidence for the presence of a 9.1M⊙ object in the system named VFTS 243. The orbital period of this system is 10.4  days and the orbit is also circular. Through follow-up rigorous analysis, we arrive at the conclusion that the object is a black hole, the first one detected in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The system is also X-ray quiet, in agreement with our earlier study on the X-ray emission from black hole + main sequence systems. The above number statistics show how big an observing program needs to be undertaken to unambiguously find black holes via radial velocity monitoring of observed massive stars. In the Milky Way, we have found another system, HD 130298, that could be another candidate to host a stellar-mass black hole. Our journey towards identifying a population of X-ray quiet black holes has only started, and we aim to slowly but surely hunt them down, through future observational surveys, one black hole at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Precise Measurement of Flux Density of Radio Emissions from the Sun using Day-time Celestial Radio Sources</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;During astronomical observation, astronomers measure the amount of energy emitted by astronomical objects. This energy is generally measured in terms of the flux density of the source. At radio frequencies, these measurements are calibrated using calibrator sources, which have known constant flux densities. Since the Sun is about 1000 times brighter at radio frequencies than the calibrator sources, estimating the flux density of the solar radio emission is challenging. With the new generation radio telescope, the Murchison Widefield Array, it is now possible to observe the faint background radio sources simultaneously with the Sun. This is the first such an observation has been made, which seems like “observing stars in the day”. Using these background radio sources it is now possible to estimate the flux density of the solar radio emission with much better accuracy, which is important to understand the emission mechanisms of solar radio emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most physics experiments, researchers measure various quantities in different units, like the mass of a body measured in grams, the length of an object measured in centimeters, and so on. Similarly, Astronomers also measure different quantities during astronomy observations, which can be used to understand the physical properties of that astronomical object. In astronomy, measurements are done in some well-defined units, like any other area of physics. One such important quantity in astronomy is the &lt;em&gt;flux density&lt;/em&gt;, which defines the amount of energy received per unit of time from astronomical sources if collected over a unit area and unit solid angle for a monochromatic emission. At radio wavelengths, the unit of this flux density is &lt;em&gt;Jansky (Jy)&lt;/em&gt;, named after the pioneer of radio
astronomy, Karl. J. Jansky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an astronomer observes the radio emission from a celestial object using a radio telescope, the tiny amount of incident radio emission is converted into electronic voltages by the very sensitive electronic instruments of the radio telescope. The corresponding power generated by these very tiny voltages is recorded in some arbitrary units. But, to understand the physical processes happening on that celestial object, astronomers need to convert this measured power into the units of &lt;em&gt;Jy&lt;/em&gt;. The process to convert this is known as flux density calibration. Precise measurement of the flux density in units of &lt;em&gt;Jy&lt;/em&gt; is essential to properly measure other physical properties, like distance, size, temperature, and so on, of that astronomical source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is routinely done using a bright radio source with a well-pre-defined flux density. These are called calibrator sources. While observing the Sun at radio wavelengths, this standard approach does not work. The flux density of the Sun is about 1000 times more than the brightest celestial radio source in the sky. Like at the optical wavelengths, it is tough to observe the background sources in the sky at radio wavelengths when the Sun is in the sky. Hence, to obtain the flux density of the Sun at radio wavelengths, solar physicists have used different laboratory measurements of the properties of the instrument to estimate the flux density of solar radio emission. But those estimations had comparatively large errors in the flux density.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;observing-stars-in-the-day&quot;&gt;Observing Stars in the Day&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/flux_density_radio_emission_devojyoti/image1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Fig. 1 : An image of the daytime sky at radio frequency (80 MHz). The image is made from the observations taken with the instrument called the Murchison Widefield Array, which can observe a large, about 2500 square degrees of the sky at a time. The red circle in the image marks the Sun. All small white dots in the image are background sources
emitting radio frequencies, including stars, galaxies, quasars, pulsars, and others.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For precise flux density calibration of solar observation, several background radio sources with well-known flux densities must be observed during the daytime. This is extremely challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite great challenges, a team of solar physicists from NCRA, led by Devojyoti Kansabanik, have successfully observed more than 80 background radio sources with the Sun in the field of view (FOV) of the telescope using images having a dynamic range of 1000. The dynamic range is the ratio between the brightest and faintest emission detected in the image. They used one of the most advanced telescopes in the world, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), situated in the western Australian desert, to make this high dynamic range image. This image is shown in Figure 1. A red circle marks the Sun, and all other small white dots are the radio emissions from background stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies. They detected more than 80 sources with the Sun in the sky. This is the first time such an image of a daytime sky is made, which seems like &lt;em&gt;observing stars in the day&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;precise-measurement-of-flux-density-of-the-radio-sun&quot;&gt;Precise Measurement of Flux Density of the Radio Sun&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kansabanik et al. use these background radio sources to estimate the flux density of the radio Sun. The known flux density of these sources is obtained from the GLEAM survey and determines a scalar number for each source to match their flux density obtained from the image with the previously known values. They have found that these scalar numbers are constant for the full image. Hence, the same scalar number can be used to obtain the true flux density of the Sun in units of &lt;em&gt;Jy&lt;/em&gt;. This method allows them to measure solar flux density with a precision of 10 %, which is about 3 to 6 times more precise than the previous method developed by Oberoi et al. 2017. They also found that the 10% error is mostly coming from the error on the known flux densities from GLEAM of these radio sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kansabanik et al. also devise a method exploiting the extreme stability of the MWA. They demonstrated that a very precise solar flux density could be obtained only using an analytical function of frequency without using any dedicated observation of flux density calibrator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;importance-for-future-observations-of-the-sun-and-heliosphere&quot;&gt;Importance for Future Observations of the Sun and Heliosphere&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As said earlier, astronomers use precise flux density measurements to estimate several physical parameters of the celestial source. The radio emission from quiet solar corona or coronal mass ejections can be used to measure those media’s temperature, magnetic field, and electron properties. The estimated values of these plasma parameters strongly depend on the precision of the flux density measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides achieving precise flux density measurement, the first-ever successful detection of a large number of faint background radio sources makes it possible to observe the heliosphere close to the Sun using a wide FOV instrument, which is otherwise impossible. These sources and their polarized emission can be used in the future to measure the magnetic field in interplanetary space. When a large amount of plasma is erupted from theSun in the form of a CME and crosses the background sources, its polarization properties get changed by the magnetic field of the CME plasma. A similar phenomenon can be observed when magnetized solar wind passes through the line of sight of these background sources. The changes in polarization properties of them can be an efficient method to measure the magnetic field in the heliosphere over a larger region, which is rather challenging and only limited to some vantage point measurements directly from a handful of spacecraft. Work is currently underway to use the polarization properties of these sources to achieve this objective.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vainu Bappu Observatory: the telescope town of India</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A popular article describing the history and contributions of the Vainu Bappu Observatory: the telescope town of India.&lt;br /&gt;
My affair with the observatory is also highlighted in brief.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development of astronomy in ancient civilizations like during the times of Babylonians, Greeks, Egyptians, etc. took place due to some fundamental needs. Some of these needs were predicting seasons precisely which helped the ancient people in agriculture, using the night sky for proper navigation while travelling in uncharted areas without having any compass or clock, fixing the time for religious rites, etc. The earliest recorded astronomical observations date back to around 1600 BCE by Babylonians, much before the beginning of the Christian era. As time progressed, advancement in astronomy took place gradually. And in parallel to this, an overall progress in science and technology also occurred. History shows that studying astronomy has generated fundamental knowledge which has benefited every human being through ages. For example, the discovery of gravitation by Newton led to the understanding of planetary motion, which further laid the foundation of space technology – a boon of science which has benefited almost every human being. STD phone, mobile, internet, etc. are some of the results of the development of space technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, invention of telescope and then studying the sky with bigger and better telescopes stationed in different astronomical observatories has greatly helped in this progress of astronomy since the past few hundred years. Encyclopedia Britannica defines an ‘astronomical observatory’ as “any structure containing telescopes and auxiliary instruments with which to observe celestial objects”. Like different other countries, India also possesses a long tradition of astronomy since ancient times [1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing in the present day twenty-first century, India possesses several world-class research institutes and observatories carrying high-class researches in astronomy. One such important astronomical observatory situated in Indian soil is the Vainu Bappu Observatory, a place which one can truly be considered as the ‘Telescope City of India’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;vainu-bappu-observatory-vbo-telescope-city-of-india&quot;&gt;Vainu Bappu Observatory (VBO): Telescope city of India&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 200 km south-west of Chennai and 175 km south-east of Bangalore, in the Tirupathur district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu lies the picturesque Javadi hills. Amidst this forested vegetation, near the neighborhoods of the village known as Kavalur and at an altitude of around 750 m (longitude 78° 49.6’ E; latitude 12° 34.6’ N) is located the Vainu Bappu Observatory (VBO) – one of the most important and active astronomical observatories in India and also in Asia. Situated away from light pollution and hustles-bustles of any big city, VBO is operated by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spread over an area of 40-hectare, this place attracts astronomers and researchers from across the country who are involved in studying celestial objects like stars, exoplanets, galaxies, etc. and also engineers, operators and other staff members who look after the proper functioning of the observatory. Apart from these busy and always cheerful people, VBO is filled with a variety of greenery of tropical region besides a number of medicinal plants. This is because the area is inside a protected forest. Monkeys are regular visitors among animals. And occasionally, appearance of some wildlife like deer, snakes and scorpions also greet the people working inside the campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the location of VBO provides advantages for night sky observation for astronomers. Apart from being reasonably away from city lights and industrial areas, this particular location was chosen in order to be closer to the Earth’s equator. Thus, coverage of both northern and southern hemispheres with equal ease becomes possible. Moreover, the longitudinal position of VBO is such that it is the only major astronomical facility between Australia and South Africa for observing the southern celestial objects [2].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VBO traces its root far back in history. I shall discuss here in brief about how it was established. The first astronomical observatory in India was established at Madras (now Chennai) in 1786 by the East India Company “for promoting the knowledge of astronomy, geography and navigation in India.” It became the premier institute in India for works on the fundamental positions of stars during the 19th century.  A catalogue of 11, 015 southern hemisphere stars was produced by the Madras observatory in 1843 under the guidance of T.G. Taylor, the then Director of the observatory. This is the famous Madras Catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research in planetary science and stellar astronomy at the Madras Observatory reached its peak during the latter half of the 19th century, under the leadership of Norman Pogson, the Director of the observatory during 1861-1891. With his Indian assistants Pogson measured accurately the positions of around 50, 000 stars, discovered six variable stars and six asteroids during this period. In 1867, an Indian astronomer, Chintamani Ragoonathacharry (1838-1932), an assistant of Pogon, discovered a variable star– R Reticuli. This is probably the first recorded astronomical discovery by an Indian in the era of telescopes.  Then, during the Total Solar Eclipse on August 18, 1868, the first spectroscopes were used to observe an eclipse event. So this eclipse became an important landmark which signaled the birth of solar physics in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Pogson’s death (June 23, 1891), initiatives were taken to establish a separate solar physics observatory. Following the decision, Kodaikanal Solar Observatory was established at Kodaikanal, Tamilnadu within few years. It started working officially on April 1, 1899. However, due to the climate it was understood that Kodaikanal can provide very few nights available for observation. In 1945, the Government of India appointed a committee, chaired by the eminent physicist Meghnad Saha which started planning the post-war development of astronomy in India. Manali Kallat Vainu Bappu, a great visionary who took over as the director of the Kodaikanal Observatory in 1960 knew that Kodaikanal is not a suitable place for stellar research. However, establishing an observatory for stellar studies and optical astronomy was the dream of M.K. Vainu Bappu. So he led a search since 1962 for finding a suitable site in southern India for establishing an optical observatory. He succeeded in finding a sleepy little hamlet i.e. Kavalur in the Javadi Hills as a suitable site for establishing optical telescopes for observing celestial objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observations began in 1968 with a 38 cm telescope made in the backyard of the Kodaikanal Observatory [3]. Then in 1971, a fully autonomous research institute was formed under complete funding from the Government of India, which came to be known as the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) [4]. Located in Bangalore, IIA took over the VBO facility henceforth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;facilities-at-vbo-2-5-6&quot;&gt;Facilities at VBO &lt;i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[2, 5, 6]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presently, VBO boosts of a number of sophisticated telescopes and asoociated instruments for looking at the heavens. The historical 1-m Carl Zeiss reflecting telescope, the 2.34-m Vainu Bappu Telescope, the recently installed 1.3-m J.C. Bhattacharya Telescope forms the major facilities. The first telescope was of 38 cm (15-inch) aperture, with which astronomical observations were started in 1968 at VBO. Later, a 75 cm (30-inch) telescope was completely designed and fabricated at the workshops of the IIA. It is still used for observations at VBO. Another 45-cm aperture joined the arsenal within few years. In recent years, one more telescope, known as the ‘DIMM Telescope’ also stands tall in the campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in 1972, a 1.02-m (primary mirror diameter) class reflecting telescope made by Carl Zeiss Jena was installed at VBO. Having the Ritchey-Chretien F/13 optical configuration, this remained as one of the primary facility for observing celestial objects for over a decade. It is working fully till now and is attached with two instruments for observations, a stellar optical polarimeter and the Universal Astronomical Grating Spectrograph (UAGS). Anyone of them can be used at a time attaching with the telescope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on January 6, 1986, another 2.34-m (93 inch) diameter reflecting telescope was inaugurated in the observatory. Completely designed and built in India, this telescope project was started by Vainu Bappu. However, he passed away in 1982 and could not see the successful installation and working of this dream telescope. On January 6, 1986, the observatory was renamed as the Vainu Bappu Observatory and the 2.3-m telescope as ‘Vainu Bappu Telescope’ (VBT) [6]. It remained as the largest telescope in Asia until a 3.6-meter telescope was set up at Devasthal, near Nainital, by ARIES. It is majorly used for deep sky observations including stars and galaxies currently using two instruments at prime focus. It is operated as a national facility and attracts proposals from all over the country and occasionally from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another recent addition to these existing facilities is the 1.3-m aperture J.C. Bhattacharya Telescope, popularly known as the JCBT. It was installed in April 2014 and was named after the ex-Director of VBO, Dr. Jagadish Chandra Bhattacharya. Possessing a Ritchey-Chretien F/8 optical configuration, JCBT has three instrument ports. The main port consists a 2k x 4k CCD system for direct imaging purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;major-discoveries-and-research-highlights&quot;&gt;Major discoveries and research highlights&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributions of VBO in astronomy are immense. This included some major discoveries which are discussed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 1-m telescope started producing fruitful results just within few months after it began operation in January, 1972. In June, 1972, it discovered the presence of a thin atmosphere around Ganymede, the largest satellite of Jupiter [7].&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In March, 1977, rings of Uranus were discovered by J. C. Bhattacharya (Director of VBO after M. K. Vainu Bappu) and his colleagues while observing through the same telescope [8].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/vainu_bappu_telescope_town_gourav/image6.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 6: News on confirmation of the rings of Uranus published in Deccan Herald newspaper on April 28, 1981 (credit:http://prints.iiap.res.in/bitstream/handle/2248/1059/E7.2.pdf;jsessionid=F7FDBA92400FD589617ED58C49E0ED30?sequence=1)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then in 1984, the discovery of a thin outer ring around Saturn was reported by VBO using the same telescope [9].&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another important discovery was made using the 45 cm Schmidt telescope. On February 17, 1988, a new minor planet was discovered by a team of six astronomers led by R. Rajamohan [10]. It was a part of a special search program for asteroids called ‘Project Kalki’. Later, this asteroid was named ‘4130 Ramanujan’ after the legendary Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. This became the first discovery of an asteroid from the Indian soil in the 20th century.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another notable work performed from VBO was to survey the stars of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) galaxy using ultraflow dispersion spectroscopy. Moreover, astronomers of IIA started observing the famous supernova of 1987, i.e. SN1987A in LMC within 48 hours of the discovery. Observing this supernova in details using both 1-m and the 75 cm telescopes, despite its low elevation in the southern sky, proved the importance of the geographic location of Kavalur. Apart from these major achievements, front-line research is carried out at VBO in present days also, using different focal plane instrument facilities. Research at VBO focuses in observing and studying most of the areas of optical astronomy viz. solar system objects, stars, star clusters, galaxies, stellar explosions, blazars, optical imaging of gamma-ray burst fields, etc. Communication facilities via the VSAT satellite connection are available for every user for the telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;vbo-and-me-a-personal-account&quot;&gt;VBO and me: a personal account&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large number of Indian observational astronomers owe a lot to VBO. Many of the major projects leading to PhD by observational Indian astronomers have been carried out using data obtained from the VBT, or at least any one telescope facility from VBO. I am also one among those numerous researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My official tie-up with VBO started since October, 2017. Being an MPhil scholar of astrophysics at the CHRIST (Deemed to be University), I started observing a carefully selected sample of classical Be (Be hereafter) stars using the historical 1-m telescope at VBO. It was a study where I, my supervisor and co-supervisor collaborated with IIA. Continuous monitoring of these stars was necessary for few years to study the disc formation and dissipation timescales in Be stars. I fell in love with the serene beauty, wonderful co-operative staff members of the campus from the very first days. And then started a never forgettable journey of my life. The same project became a part of my PhD thesis which I led as the Principal Investigator since February 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, we received over 150 nights of observation to obtain the spectra for our selected stars. A total of 61 nights I myself have stayed at VBO doing the observations, which would have definitely increased if COVID19 did not hit the world. I can truly say that these 61 nights of my life were among the best ones I have experienced. It was during my stay at Kavalur I was able to work for over 12 hours a day, in a calm and quiet place without any man-made disturbances. This was the place where I was able to complete a major portion of my analysis works related to MPhil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whole night of observations was a routine schedule when the only sound was originated from the chirpings of monkeys, and the murmurs of insects mixed with an un-describable drizzling sound of leaves of trees due to mild breeze. Morning arrived with excellent views of sunrise and amazing roars of innumerable birds. The days passed by mostly sleeping and taking care of my belongings from the anytime invaders – the monkeys. Occasional appearance of scorpions and snakes was also not something unusual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the most beautiful periods of spending at VBO, I presume, is during the summers, especially April. Apart from clear skies, almost the entire campus becomes colorful with the arrival of flowers in the treetops. For me, working in such an environment was like a childhood dream come true, a dream which turned to love and then into passion ultimately setting my aim – to become an observational astronomer studying the stars. I do cherish these wonderful days spent in the midst of telescopes, jungles, warm people and serene nature while working for my MPhil and then PhD. As an astronomer in near future, I would definitely love to maintain my attachment with VBO, forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rapid development of technology, presently we are actually standing in a golden era of astronomy. Apart from the VBO, India currently possesses several world-class research institutes and observatories carrying high-classresearches in astronomy. One such observatory is the Indian astronomical Observatory (IAO) located in the remote village of Hanle, Ladakh in the Jammu &amp;amp; Kashmir district. Situated at a height of 4, 517 meters from the sea level, this place was found to be a world-class astronomical site for establishing a large optical telescope. IAO was started in 2001 and contains the 2-m (200-cm) aperture Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), which was dedicated to the nation in August 2001. Like the VBO, IAO is also operated by IIA, Bangalore. The HCT facility can be operated from a remote control centre at Hoskote, around 35 km from Bangalore, making it one of the most powerful remote controlled telescope facility of the world. The HCT is being used to study several types of celestial objects and phenomenon including stellar spectroscopy, galactic and extra-galactic star forming regions, young stellar objects, star clusters, supernova, gamma-ray bursts, etc. During the past decade, different other facilities such as the 0.7-m wide field robotic telescope (under the GROWTH project), Himalayan Gamma Ray Array (HAGAR), imaging Cherenkov telescope (MACE) have come up due to the infrastructure developed by IIA at the IAO site. The site is also being characterized for another 10-m class telescope which is a future project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participation in international projects was also envisaged in the Astronomy and Astrophysics “Decadal Vision Document 2004” sponsored by the Indian Academy of Sciences and the Astronomical Society of India. Development and successful operation of ASTROSAT - India’s first astronomy satellite was a major achievement in the past decade. Moreover, India is now playing an active role in participating in different future world class megaprojects related to astronomy. India-TMT, LIGO-India, SKA (Square Kilometer Array) are some such highly ambitious projects, whereas Aditya L1, NLST, INSIST, Gaganyaan are some of the future space missions to study various objects and phenomenon of the universe. Plans to send future missions to the Moon and Mars are also under consideration. Hence, one can understand that India’s future in astronomy seems truly promising. Now, it is up to the intellect of motivated young Indians whether we will be able to exploit these facilities fully and hence, will be able to carry forward the astronomy tradition of India or not.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What makes radio-quiet AGN radio-quiet? A polarization perspective</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There is a lack of consensus on the origin of radio emission in radio-quiet (RQ) and radio-intermediate (RI) AGN. Primary contenders include low-power radio jets, winds, star-formation and coronal emission. Our multi-frequency, multi-scale radio polarization study has revealed a multi-component (jet + ‘wind’), stratified radio outflow in the two intermediate AGN, III Zw 2 and Mrk 231. Each strata of the outflow has a characteristic magnetic field geometry. Our radio polarization study in conjunction with the [O III] emission-line study of five RQ quasars have provided insights into the interplay of jets, winds and emission-line gas. A close interaction between the different emission components themselves as well as with the local host environments is likely responsible for the stunted nature of the radio outflows in RQ and RI AGN. Our findings are also consistent with the idea that radio-loudness of a source is a function of its epoch of observation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic and extremely luminous phenomena in the Universe. They emit radiation at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. This radiation which is of non-stellar origin is believed to originate from supermassive black holes (BHs; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; − 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; M⊙, the mass of the sun; see review by &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.aa.22.090184.002351&quot;&gt;Rees, 1984&lt;/a&gt;) as matter accretes onto them through an accretion disk. The different constituents of an AGN, some of which have been inferred indirectly from multi-wavelength continuum and spectroscopic observations, include (see Figure 1):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a BH at the centre of the host galaxy,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an accretion disk,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a hot magnetized corona presumably located above the accretion disk,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;high velocity and dense gas clouds (known as the broad line region or BLR) which give rise to the broad emission lines in the optical spectra,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;low velocity and relatively less dense gas clouds (known as the narrow line region or NLR) which give rise to the narrow emission lines in the optical spectra,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an obscuring torus of gas and dust that hides the BLR clouds from sight for certain viewing angles (&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139170901&quot;&gt;Peterson, 1997&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1086/133630&quot;&gt;Urry &amp;amp; Padovani, 1995&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/radio_quiet_agn_polarization_silpa/image1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 1: The standard model of AGN from &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1086/133630&quot;&gt;Urry &amp;amp; Padovani, 1995&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small fraction (10−20%) of AGN also launch relativistic, powerful and collimated structures called jets at radio frequencies (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1086/115207&quot;&gt;Kellermann et al., 1989&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0301309&quot;&gt;Urry, 2003&lt;/a&gt;). These jets are launched perpendicular to the BH-accretion disk interface and extend over scales ranging from a few hundred kiloparsecs (kpc) to several megaparsecs (Mpc). This class of AGN is called the radio-loud (RL) AGN. On the other hand, the majority of AGN (80−90%) launch weak and small-scale radio jets that typically extend to less than 10 kpc. Alternatively, they may also host broadly collimated wind-like or diffuse radio outflows. These constitute the radio-quiet (RQ) class of AGN. The division between RL and RQ AGN is mathematically shown in terms of the radio-loudness parameter (R) given by &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1086/115207&quot;&gt;Kellermann et al. (1989)&lt;/a&gt;, which is the ratio of radio flux density at 5 GHz to optical flux density in the B-band. According to this definition, RL AGN has R &amp;gt; 10 while RQ AGN has R ≤ 10. &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1086/310386&quot;&gt;Falcke et al. (1996)&lt;/a&gt; proposed another class of AGN with intermediate R values (10 &amp;lt; R &amp;lt; 250), known as the radio-intermediate (RI) AGN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;key-concepts&quot;&gt;Key concepts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two widely discussed mechanisms for jet production in the literature include: &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/199.4.883&quot;&gt;Blandford &amp;amp; Znajek (1977)&lt;/a&gt; mechanism, hereafter referred to as BZ77 and &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/199.4.883&quot;&gt;Blandford &amp;amp; Payne (1982)&lt;/a&gt; mechanism, hereafter referred to as BP82. In BZ77, the jets are produced by electromagnetic extraction of energy and angular momentum from a spinning BH, while in BP82, the energy and angular momentum are magnetically extracted from the accretion disk. The origin of radio emission in RL AGN is often attributed to the BZ77 mechanism while the origin of radio emission in RQ and RI AGN is poorly understood. It is not clear if their emission mechanism is that of BZ77 or BP82 or both. The possible scenarios for radio emission in RQ AGN as proposed in the literature include low-power jets, winds, star-formation, coronal emission, and a combination of them (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-019-0765-4&quot;&gt;Panessa et al., 2019&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the open questions on jet physics that we are trying to address include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where are the jets launched from?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What causes the collimation of jets?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the jets composed of?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why are the jets in RQ and RI AGN stunted or small-scale as opposed to the large-scale jets in RL AGN?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radio emission from the jets is basically the synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic electrons spiraling around the magnetic (B) field lines. Synchrotron emission from an individual electron is highly confined to a narrow cone pointing towards the direction of the electron motion (a process known as “beaming”), and radiation from an ensemble of relativistic electrons is intrinsically linearly polarized. Radio polarization observations can provide information about the orderliness and orientation of the B field giving rise to the synchrotron emission. According to the synchrotron theory, the inferred B fields are parallel to the electric polarization vectors for optically thick regions like the core while perpendicular, in the case of optically thin regions like the jets, lobes and hotspots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards briefly addressing the key questions listed above, we carried out a multi- frequency, multi-scale radio polarization study of the RI Palomar Green quasar, III Zw 2 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab1870&quot;&gt;Silpa et al., 2021a&lt;/a&gt;) as well as of a quasar that is currently transitioning from the RQ to RL state, viz., Mrk 231 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab2110&quot;&gt;Silpa et al., 2021b&lt;/a&gt;) with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and the Very Large Array (VLA). We find a stratified radio outflow in these sources, which could either be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a “spine-sheath” structure in the radio jet, where the ‘spine’ refers to a narrow relativistic jet component and the ‘sheath’ refers to a broader sub-relativistic jet component, enclosing the spine; or&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a ‘jet + wind’ composite structure, where the ‘wind’ component could either be a magnetized accretion disk wind or the outer layers of a broadened jet (like a jet sheath) or a combination of both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find that each component of the stratified outflow has a characteristic B field geometry. Theoretical models emphasize on the importance of helical B fields (which comprise of poloidal and toroidal field components) for the production and propagation of jets. From our study we find that the inferred B fields are parallel to the local direction of the radio outflow in case of the jet spine/jet component while they are transverse in the case of the jet sheath/wind component (see Figure 4). The parallel inferred B fields represent the poloidal component of the helical field while the transverse inferred B fields represent the toroidal component (e.g., see Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the uGMRT, we also detect a kpc-scale radio lobe to the south in III Zw 2 (annotated as ML in Figure 3) that is misaligned with the primary lobes (annotated as NEL and SWL in Figure 3). Based on the two-frequency spectral index image and electron lifetimes estimated using the “equipartition” equations (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1086/165182&quot;&gt;O’Dea &amp;amp; Owen, 1987&lt;/a&gt;), we find that the misaligned lobe emission does not arise from any past activity of AGN. Rather it is being actively fed by the nucleus through intermittent fueling, similar to the large and ‘alive’ radio lobes observed in the radio galaxy M87 at 330 MHz with the VLA (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1086/317151&quot;&gt;Owen et al., 2000&lt;/a&gt;). The lobe characteristics, such as a mean spectral index between −0.6 and −0.7 and a lack of clear spectral steepening with distance from the core, are also similar to those of the ‘sputtering’ AGN, NGC 3998 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201936796&quot;&gt;Sridhar et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;), suggesting that the AGN in III Zw 2 is similarly ‘sputtering’. We also note that the curved VLA jet in III Zw 2 terminates in ‘bow-shock-like’ radio structures on either side, instead of compact hotspots typically seen in Fanaroff–Riley Class II radio galaxies. A similar feature is seen in the restarted jet simulations of &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1086/169762&quot;&gt;Clarke &amp;amp; Burns (1991)&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting the presence of restarted jet activity in III Zw 2, possibly on very short time scales, ranging in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

The length of these vectors is proportional to polarized intensity and the orientation of the vectors is determined by the polarization angle. The regions with longer ticks are highly polarized regions while the regions with shorter ticks are less polarized regions. NEL refers to the north-eastern lobe, SWL refers to the south-western lobe and ML refers to the misaligned lobe in III Zw 2.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As already mentioned, RQ and RI AGN are known to be powered by multiple radio emission processes. It is a good exercise to estimate the relative contributions of the individual processes towards the overall budget of the radio emission. This exercise can be carried out for sources that have multi-scale, multi-frequency radio data since different emission components will be sampled at different resolutions and frequencies. We carried out a similar study for Mrk 231, and we have been able to obtain first-order estimates of the relative contributions from the weakly collimated jet, AGN-driven wind, and starburst-driven wind to the total radio emission observed. Our results suggest that while the starburst-driven wind accounts for ∼ 10−20% of the total radio emission, both AGN wind and the weakly collimated jet contribute significantly to the rest of the emission in Mrk 231.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the radiation propagates through the magneto-ionic medium (i.e. composed of free charges and B fields) between the source and the observer, the two orthogonal components of the electromagnetic wave interact differently with the local free charges. This results in different refractive indices and speeds of propagation for the two components, which in turn induces a delay between them that shows up as a rotation of the plane of polarization. This phenomenon is called Faraday rotation. Owing to the effect of Faraday rotation, the intrinsic polarization angle differs from its observed value by an amount that depends on the square of wavelength. The constant of proportionality is called rotation measure (RM), which physically depends on the line-of-sight component of the B field, and the electron number density and path length of the Faraday-rotating medium. Based on the 3-frequency RM images of Mrk 231, we find that the radio outflow in this source becomes increasingly matter-dominated away from the core, suggesting that the synchrotron plasma mixes with the entrained gas as the radio outflow (jet/lobe and/or wind) propagates through the ambient medium. Thus, the role of the local environments is important to consider while studying AGN outflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study carried out on a small sample of RQ quasars with the radio polarization data from the VLA and the [O III] emission-line imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we find that the polarized radio emission is more often spatially anti-correlated with [O III] emission (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac1044&quot;&gt;Silpa et al., 2022&lt;/a&gt;). A similar anti-correlation has been observed in RL AGN in the literature (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1086/161594&quot;&gt;van Breugel et al., 1984&lt;/a&gt;) where it has been suggested that the radio emission is depolarized by the emission-line gas. We find evidence for mixing of the entrained thermal gas with the synchrotron plasma in the lobes of these sources, which could be resulting in the internal depolarization of the lobe emission. The anti-correlation between polarization and emission-line gas could be interpreted as a signature of the jet/wind-gas interaction and possibly a source of AGN feedback in these sources. AGN feedback is a process by which the energy and matter are transported from the central engine to the interstellar medium of the host galaxy via AGN outflows like jets and winds, with an effect of either heating and/or expelling the star-forming material or enhancing local star- formation (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1016/j.newar.2011.11.003&quot;&gt;Alexander &amp;amp; Hickox, 2012&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-astro-081811-125521&quot;&gt;Fabian, 2012&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.3389/fspas.2017.00042&quot;&gt;Morganti, 2017&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-018-0403-6&quot;&gt;Harrison et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;discussion&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a close interaction between the multiple components of the radio outflow (jet and wind) and the surrounding gaseous environment may be producing stunted jets in RQ and RI AGN. Drawing analogies from X-ray binaries, we propose a model in Figure 4 that demonstrates a possible connection between the spectral state changes (hard/soft) of the accretion disk and the nature of radio outflows in different radio classes of AGN. In this model, the outer regions of the accretion disk are in soft spectral state, and are characterized by the thermal emission from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-010-2585-0_13&quot;&gt;Shakura &amp;amp; Sunyaev (1973)&lt;/a&gt; disk, which is an optically thick and a geometrically thin disk. The magnetic flux accumulation close to the BH is not efficient enough for the launching of powerful radio jets in case of the thin accretion disk. Therefore, this state produces suppressed radio jets, and strong winds that could either be driven by the BP82 mechanism or could be a jet sheath (see Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the inner regions of the accretion disk are in hard spectral state, and are characterized by an advection-dominated accretion flow (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1086/187381&quot;&gt;Narayan &amp;amp; Yi, 1994&lt;/a&gt;), where the energy, instead of being radiated away, is advected into the BH during accretion. This state facilitates the accumulation of magnetic flux close to the BH, and therefore produces a powerful and steady radio jet or the jet spine, driven by the BZ77 mechanism (see Figure 4). Such a co-axial outflow would appear co-spatial in projection, as seen in our sources. It is very likely that the different emission layers like the jet spine/jet and the jet sheath/wind interact with each other (this refers to the region between BZ77- and BP82-driven components in Figure 4). Consequently, this may either disrupt the jet, or most of the mass and energy may be carried away by the wind rather than the jet. This could result in low-powered, small-scaled jets seen in RQ and RI AGN, as opposed to the large-scaled, powerful jets in the RL AGN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/radio_quiet_agn_polarization_silpa/image4.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 4: A cartoon to illustrate a possible connection between the changing spectral states of the accretion disk and the multi-component radio outflow in AGN, as inferred from our work on RQ and RI AGN (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab1870&quot;&gt;Silpa et al., 2021a&lt;/a&gt;). The white ticks denote the B-field vectors.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, the transition between the hard and soft spectral states in regular RL and RQ AGN occurs on time scales of 106 − 108 yr (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/225.1.1&quot;&gt;Alexander &amp;amp; Leahy, 1987&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20000198&quot;&gt;Enßlin &amp;amp; Gopal- Krishna, 2001&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13459.x&quot;&gt;Shabala et al., 2008&lt;/a&gt;). However, this may occur on much shorter time scales, like decades, in intermittent/sputtering AGN sources. Such rapid transitions may explain the co-existence of a jet of moderate radio luminosity with an accretion disk wind in such sources. Furthermore, this model is in support of the idea that radio-loudness is a function of the epoch at which the source is observed (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09194.x&quot;&gt;Nipoti et al., 2005&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab9598&quot;&gt;Kunert-Bajraszewska et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08872&quot;&gt;Nyland et al., 2020&lt;/a&gt;). This could imply that the RQ AGN are the sources which are in soft state, launching strong winds and suppressed jets, and RL AGN are the sources which are in hard state, launching powerful jets, at the time of their observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key takeaways from this article are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RQ and RI AGN are likely powered by multi-component radio outflows (jet + ‘wind’). Signatures of possible outflow stratification emerge from the different inferred magnetic field structures in the polarization observations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A close interaction between the different emission components themselves as well as with the local host environments may be the reason for the stunted nature of the radio outflows in RQ and RI AGN. 
The radio-loudness of a source may be a function of its epoch of observation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Gravitational Waves in an Inhomogeneous Universe</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Space is quite inhomogeneous at small scales. These inhomogeneities may play a significant role in governing the physical phenomena at this scale. Here we have analysed the impact of these inhomogeneities on the Gravitational Wave (GW) observables. For this analysis we have made use of a toy model of the inhomogeneous spacetime. Our analysis shows that the amplitude of GW gets affected by these inhomogeneities and this effect is governed by our model parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cosmological Principle states that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic at large scales. Various surveys like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sdss.org/&quot;&gt;Sloan Digital Sky Survey&lt;/a&gt; have revealed &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-pdf/443/1/241/4292640/stu1118.pdf&quot;&gt;deviations from homogeneity on samples as large as 500 h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc&lt;/a&gt;. In comparison, &lt;a href=&quot;https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/milkyway_info.html&quot;&gt;Milky Way galaxy is about 30 kpc across&lt;/a&gt;. These inhomogeneities play an important role in governing the physical phenomena at this scale. The physical phenomena that we have considered here is the propagation of Gravitational Waves (GWs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GWs have been a fascinating feature of Physics ever since &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/3527608958.ch7&quot;&gt;Einstein&lt;/a&gt;
predicted their existence. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/gravitational-waves&quot;&gt;GWs are ripples in spacetime&lt;/a&gt;
produced when the acceleration of the second mass moment of the associated motion of a system of masses is non-vanishing. This is valid provided higher order moments are neglected. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March01/Carroll3/Carroll6.html&quot;&gt;TT (transverse traceless) gauge&lt;/a&gt; this second mass moment is given by the quadrupole moment. These waves move outwards from their source. Before reaching the observer these waves propagate through the spacetime. In this work, we have analysed how the amplitude of these GWs gets affected by the inhomogeneities present in spacetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;formalism&quot;&gt;Formalism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To study an inhomogeneous spacetime, a suitable averaging procedure is required. In this work, we have used &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1001800617177&quot;&gt;Buchert’s averaging procedure&lt;/a&gt;
proposed by Thomas Buchert. Buchert’s approach was to first decompose Einstein’s equation into a set of dynamical equations for scalar quantities using Raychaudhuri equation and then average those scalar quantities. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/pram/069/01/0049-0076&quot;&gt;Raychaudhuri equation is concerned with the kinematics of flow.&lt;/a&gt;
Using Einstein’s equation and Raychaudhuri equation ensures that the procedure is GR compliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our analysis we have used a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2006/11/003&quot;&gt;toy model&lt;/a&gt;
based on Buchert’s averaging procedure. This toy model presents a simplified picture of the inhomogeneous spacetime where a domain of space has been divided into two types of regions - one overdense region and one underdense region. Here, overdense region is a closed, dust only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/journey-cosmos-flrw-metric-friedmann-equation/&quot;&gt;Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker&lt;/a&gt;
(FLRW) region while the underdense region is an empty FLRW region. The physical interpretation of this toy model is that the domain of space of our toy model represents the spacetime through which GW is propagating. The overdense region is the matter filled region that the GW encounters in its path while the underdense region is the region of cosmic void.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two parameters governing our model; &lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,the volume fraction of the underdense region and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, the factor governing the time evolution of the scale factor for the underdense region. For the overdense region, there is also &lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, the volume fraction of the overdense region, which is related to &lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; by the relation: &lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; = 1. These parameters completely determine our toy model. The intervening region between source and observer through which GWs propagate can have any combination of this (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;). Therefore we have used different combinations of (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) for our analysis. Using Buchert’s averaging procedure and this toy model, we can calculate various averaged scalar quantities for the domain under analysis, like averaged density, averaged Hubble parameter, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our toy model is a theoretical model. In order to check the validity of our analysis, we need to relate the quantities calculated using our toy model with observational quantities. This is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2009/02/011&quot;&gt;Covariant Scheme&lt;/a&gt;
comes to our rescue. It relates the theoretically calculated quantities from our toy model, averaged density of the domain and averaged Hubble parameter of the domain, with angular diameter distance &lt;i&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, an observational quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The redshift-dependent part of GW amplitude is given by,

  \[A = {(1+z)^{5/3} \over D_L},\]
  
  where z is the redshift factor and \(D_L\) is the luminosity distance which is related to angular diameter distance by the relation,
  
  \(D_L = (1+z)^2 D_A.\)
  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have plotted this quantity &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; for different combinations of our model parameter in Figure 1 &amp;amp; Figure 2 and we have related these plots with the homogeneous &lt;b&gt;Λ&lt;sub&gt;CDM&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; plot as well. Figure 1 shows that for a certain combination of our model parameters, the plot for our inhomogeneous toy model is very close to the plot of homogeneous &lt;b&gt;Λ&lt;sub&gt;CDM&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; model. As we vary our model parameters from this particular combination, the plot for our toy model starts deviating from the plot of the &lt;b&gt;Λ&lt;sub&gt;CDM&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; model and this deviation increases as we vary our model parameters more and more from that particular combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows that for only one particular combination of (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, the plot for our toy model is very close to the homogeneous &lt;b&gt;Λ&lt;sub&gt;CDM&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; plot. For all other combinations of (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;β&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, there is substantial deviation from the homogeneous &lt;b&gt;Λ&lt;sub&gt;CDM&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; case. This shows that inhomogeneities in spacetime play an important role in the propagation of GWs and therefore should not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study shows that the inhomogeneities present in the spacetime have substantial effect on the observables of GWs traversing through this spacetime. Our present analysis should inspire further studies of the effect of inhomogeneous spacetime on various other physical phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One year of CosmicVarta</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CosmicVarta&lt;/strong&gt; celebrates its &lt;strong&gt;first birthday&lt;/strong&gt; today! Hurray!
It was a wonderful year indeed.
Today, we take a look back at our journey and briefly talk about our future plans.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-story&quot;&gt;Our Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astronomy and Astrophysics&lt;/strong&gt; as a subject has the potential to remove the barriers between people and unite them in a hope of understanding the cosmos. However, even though cutting-edge research is being carried out across India, a communication gap exists between the researchers and the younger students as well as the general public who may not be familiar with the technical details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the hope of bridging this gap, came together a group of enthusiastic PhD students from various research institutes across India and &lt;strong&gt;CosmicVarta&lt;/strong&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

        <title>Insight into the pulsar emmision mechanism using subpulse drifting: Subpulse drifting in PSR J1822−2256</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Long after humans figured out that the small bright dots in the night sky were just another sun-like object, and not very long after the discovery of the neutron, in the year 1933, Baade and Zwicky theorized the existence of a star made entirely of neutrons. It was called a neutron star and was thought to be leftover after the death of a rather massive star. The theory was, however, left alone due to the lack of proof.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1967, a graduate student found something strange in her data. She saw a signal coming from the sky at equal intervals in time with impeccable accuracy, unknown, until then, to any known astrophysical source. Naturally, this sparked an interest in not just the entire scientific community but also among the non-scientific folks. The phenomenon was initially ascribed to alien civilizations due to the lack of scientific reason. Within a year, the era’s greatest minds figured that the 1967 discovery was, in fact, related to the theory conjectured in 1933.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neutron star spins at incredibly high rotational velocity owing to the conservation of angular momentum. They also emit radiation from their magnetic poles, observed at a wide range of wavelengths from Gamma-ray to Radio. This combination of emission from poles and rotation caused the apparent pulsating nature of the signal as seen by a steady observer on Earth. These ‘pulsating’ objects are now commonly known as pulsars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/subpulse_drifting_parul_images/image01.jpeg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 1: 2D pulse stacks displaying the subpulse drifting modes of emission observed for J1822−2256. The modes A, B, C, and D are arranged anticlockwise. Here, the x-axis shows the pulse phase, whereas the y-axis is the pulse number. The figure clearly shows drift patterns and their distinct behaviour representing the four different drift modes.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent publication, our team tried to understand some long-standing questions related to pulsar emission, in light of new high-quality data from the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), on the pulsar J1822-2256. This work revolves around a periodic pattern found in some pulsars, different from their rotational periodicity. It has been found that the pulse observed from pulsars is not uniform and often shows sub-structures called subpulses. These subpulses are conjectured to come from small pockets of ‘sparks’. The exact working of these sparks is still unclear. But the idea is that as the pulsar rotates around its rotational axis, these sparks also rotate with a period different from the pulsar’s rotational period. Therefore, after each pulsar rotation, the spark arrangement seen by the observer is different from before. Interestingly, a diagonal pattern can be seen when the pulses are stacked in a 2D pulse stack, as shown in figure 1. This phenomenon is called subpulse drifting and gives a unique insight directly into the pulsar emission process. It is to be noted that pulsars show different kinds of drifting, and the parameters are rarely similar for any two pulsars. The number of pulsar rotations it takes for a subpulse to reappear at any given phase is denoted by the value P3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

The black dashed lines show the average profile, and the rest show the colour-coded average profile for each mode. The profiles are given arbitrary constant shifts along the y-axis for display purposes. Apart from the variation of the profiles across the different modes, the frequency-dependent behaviour of the profiles in each mode can also be observed here. (Credits: Author)

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our study found that the pulsar J1822-2256 shows at least four types of subpulse drifting modes, listed in table 1. The pulsar also seems to significantly lower or stop its emission aperiodically. The average pulsar emission (seen in an average profile, figure 2) also changes as the pulsar switches from one mode to the other. A direct implication of this finding is that the spark configuration changes as the pulsar changes its drifting modes. Through a robust calculation, we also calculated the possible number of sparks in each subpulse drifting mode. How and why the spark configuration changes are the questions that need to be answered. We further tried to explore the emission region for this pulsar. We estimated the emission heights for each subpulse drifting mode using the radius to frequency mapping model, suggesting that high-frequency emission dominantly comes from lower emission heights and low-frequency emission comes from higher altitudes. According to this new-found-knowledge, we claim that the emission we observe from the pulsar is inversely related to the number of sparks in each drifting mode. Figure 3 shows this inverse relationship between the emission height of different modes and the quantity P3, which is used to characterize the subpulse drifting modes. Therefore, each subpulse mode of emission comes from a different height in the pulsar’s magnetosphere and each mode contains a different number of sparks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the discovery of the first pulsar CP1919 by Jocelyn Bell, thousands of pulsars have been observed. Emission from pulsars has been seen at multiple wavelengths; however, not all pulsars emit at all wavelengths. Some pulsars only emit at radio frequencies, while some others only at Gamma-ray frequencies, and a small fraction also emit at multiple wavelengths. However, a majority of the pulsar population shows emission at radio frequencies, sometimes in conjunction with emission at other frequencies as well. These compact objects have been subjects of curiosity for a long time and continue to do so. Neutron stars are highly gravitating objects, only second to black holes. They have magnetic fields over a trillion times stronger than the Earth’s magnetic field. Thus, neutron stars, aka pulsars, are laboratories to study physics in extreme environments, which are otherwise impossible to attain in labs. Despite the pulsars being known for decades, they continue to be mysterious and something that will always gravitate the astronomers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Star-forming S0 Galaxies in SDSS-MaNGA: fading spirals or rejuvenated S0s?</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Galaxies are the building blocks of our universe. A comprehensive theory of how galaxies evolve with cosmic time is key to understanding how the universe turns out the way it is today. Decades of observational, theoretical and computational efforts have been devoted to this purpose. Despite this, observations continue throwing challenges that theories of galaxy evolution cannot explain. In this work, we try to address one such challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the basis of their morphology, i.e. appearance, galaxies can be divided into three classes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;●	The Spirals: Spiral galaxies possess a flat rotating disc with spiral arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;●	The &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s: &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt; galaxies possess a flat rotating disc, but lack spiral arms. Quite often, the side-view of &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s takes the shape of a convex lens, thus in the old days &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s were called Lenticulars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;●	The Ellipticals: Elliptical galaxies, on the other hand, are 3-D ellipsoidal distribution of stars, and do not have any disc-like structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical examples of the three classes are illustrated in Fig. 1 below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/star_formation_sdss_himansh_kavin_images/image1a.png&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/star_formation_sdss_himansh_kavin_images/image1b.png&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/star_formation_sdss_himansh_kavin_images/image1c.png&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through galaxy formation theories, we know that Spiral galaxies continuously form new stars. Spiral galaxies contain beautiful spiral arms - the places where new stars are born. On the other hand, &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt; and elliptical galaxies are found to have stopped any kind of active star formation. But, it turns out that there exist some &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt; galaxies in the nearby universe, which are actively star-forming. In our work, we identify a sample of 120 star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt; galaxies in a large galaxy survey known as the SDSS-MaNGA survey. The images of some of these galaxies is shown in Fig. 2 below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peculiar nature of these star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s leads us to quite a few questions. First of all, where does the star-formation happen in these galaxies? The spirals have well defined regions where new stars are born - the spiral arms. No such structure is present in the &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to answer this question, we will have to probe within these galaxies and find out where new stars are being born. We cannot do this with the conventional spectroscopic and photometric methods, since they give us the light of the entire galaxy as a whole. This does not allow us to resolve the details inside the galaxy. This is where the revolutionary MaNGA survey comes to the rescue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is so special about the MaNGA survey?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important observables of a galaxy is its spectrum. Spectrum is awesome compared to photometry. Photometry just gives you the total light emitted by the galaxy over a broad range of wavelengths. Whereas, with a spectrum you get the light of the galaxy at every wavelength! That is a lot more information! The spectrum can be used to derive various physical properties of the galaxy, like the Star-Formation Rate (SFR), stellar mass, chemical composition etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, most galaxy surveys were equipped with single-aperture spectroscopy. This means you got the spectrum of the entire galaxy as a whole. However, in recent times, advancement in technology has led to the development of Integral Field Spectrographs (IFS). IFS provides us with the spectrum of various spatial regions of a galaxy in a single observation. Let’s understand this in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image of a galaxy is divided into numerous spatial regions (similar to pixels in a photographic image). Each such region is called a spaxel (short for spatial-pixel), and we can obtain the spectrum of each spaxel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of these spaxels, we get excellent resolution over the 2D image of the galaxy.  With the spectrum of each spaxel, we get the 2D resolved image in each wavelength! Thus, in some sense, IFS provides us with 3D information about the galaxy. The first two axes are the spatial X and Y coordinates, and the third axis is the wavelength. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 3: Top - MaNGA obtains spatially resolved spectra of a galaxy. The galaxy image is divided into various spatial regions, called spaxels. Each spaxel has a spectrum. This leads to what is called a 3D galaxy data-cube (bottom). The first two axes are the spatial X and Y axis of the galaxy image. We obtain the galaxy image at each wavelength (which is the third axis).

)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDSS-MaNGA is one such IFS survey. It enables us to study properties of a galaxy in a spatially resolved manner. Thus, we shall be able to understand the physical processes going on in our star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt; galaxies in great detail. In particular, this will help us probe the interiors of these galaxies and find out where the new stars are being born!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start by studying how the Star-Formation Rate (SFR) of the star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s varies with the distance from the center of the galaxy. This will give us insights about the site and spatial extent of star-formation in these peculiar galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we studied the star formation as a function of distance from the galaxy center for the star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s, we found that they are forming new stars close to their center. This is opposite to what happens in Spiral galaxies, since most of their star-formation happens in the spiral arms present in the disc - i.e. away from the center. This is a very interesting result about the star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s, which was not known before!
Having answered where the star-formation is happening in these star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s, now we get to the even bigger question - why are they forming new stars (being &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s, they are not supposed to do that!) ? In order to answer this question, we would want to go deeper into the past of these galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of research suggests that &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt; galaxies form from Spiral galaxies. When new stars are no longer being born in a Spiral galaxy, the spiral arms slowly start to fade - and eventually disappear. This leads to a galaxy which has a disc, but no spiral arms - i.e. an &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;. So, the star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s could be a population of Spiral galaxies whose spiral arms have faded, but some star-formation activity is still going on in the center - i.e. a last burst of star-formation. This is just one hypothesis with regards to the formation of star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s could be a population of the usual &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s (with no star-formation), whose star-formation has been somehow revived. They could also be something totally out of the box - a galaxy population with a distinct past of its own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above hypotheses suggest that there can be various possible connections and comparison points between the star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s, star-forming Spirals and the usual &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s with no star-formation (also known as quenched &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s). To probe these connections, we construct control samples of star-forming spirals and quenched &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s, in addition to our main sample of star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a main property that distinguishes different classes of galaxies is how compact the spatial distribution of their stars is. An excellent way to probe this compactness is through the galaxy size - mass relation. The galaxy size is to be plotted on the Y-axis, and its stellar mass on the X-axis. It is well known that different classes of galaxies nicely separate out in this plot. We construct the size - mass relation for our star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s, star-forming Spirals and the usual quenched &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s in Fig. 4. This will help us to compare and contrast the three galaxy populations, in lieu of the hypotheses presented before regarding the star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/star_formation_sdss_himansh_kavin_images/image4.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 4: Galaxy size (Y-axis) v/s galaxy stellar mass (X-axis) for star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;SF-S0&lt;/a&gt;s), star-forming Spirals (&lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;SF-Sp&lt;/a&gt;s) and quenched &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;Q-S0&lt;/a&gt;s). Solid line denotes the median trend. (Credits: Authors)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the size - mass plane, the star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s are quite similar to the quenched &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s, and are different from star-forming Spirals. This suggests that the star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s are not fading spirals, and are likely to be the usual &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s whose star-formation has been somehow revived! This is another very interesting result which was not confirmed before!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the next natural question is, what caused the revival of star-formation in our star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s? One way in which this can happen is if another gas-rich galaxy merged with our &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;, and brought in the necessary Hydrogen gas required for forming new stars. This other galaxy must be significantly less massive than our &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;, so that the merger does not end up completely deforming our &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;. Such mergers are called minor mergers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key signature of whether a galaxy has undergone a recent minor merger is in the motion of its stars and gas. The minor merger will cause some perturbations to the main galaxy, causing the velocity of stars and gas to get disturbed, as opposed to a coherent rotation around the galaxy center. But how do we study the velocities of stars and gas within these galaxies? Again, MaNGA Integral Field Spectroscopy comes to the rescue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very useful quantity that can be derived from a spectrum is the velocity of the object along the line of sight, using the principle of Doppler effect (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys301/lectures/doppler/doppler.html&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; for more details). Using the MaNGA IFS, we obtain the velocities of stars and gas in various regions of our star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find that more than 50% of our star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s have disturbed stellar and gas velocities. In a few cases, we even find the stars and gas rotating in opposite directions about the galaxy center (Fig. 6) !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/star_formation_sdss_himansh_kavin_images/image5a.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/star_formation_sdss_himansh_kavin_images/image5b.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 5: Example of a counter-rotating star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;. Stars (left) and gas (right) rotate in the opposite sense. The gas has likely come from a smaller galaxy that has merged with the main galaxy! (Credits: Authors)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such disturbed and incoherent stellar and gas velocities indicate instabilities triggered by a recent minor merger. This merger could have brought in the necessary gas for reviving the star-formation in the star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s. Thus, we infer that minor mergers are the most likely cause for the revival of star-formation in our star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, in this work, we have been able to answer many questions about these mysterious objects called star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s. We found that the star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s form new stars primarily in their central regions, which is opposite to what happens in Spiral galaxies. We also inferred that the star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s are likely the usual &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s (which do not form new stars), in which star-formation activity has been somehow revived. We conclude that minor merger with a gas-rich galaxy has likely caused this revival. Thus, we have made good progress in solving the mystery behind the existence of star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s! Moreover, in the bigger picture, our work highlights the importance of minor-mergers as a complex ingredient that shapes how galaxies evolve with time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, quite a few concerns remain. We have 120 galaxies in this work, and ideally, we would like to have a larger sample to constrain our findings better. Many large IFS surveys are coming up in the future, and we look forward to them. Moreover, the star-forming gas of these star-forming &lt;a style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;&gt;S0&lt;/a&gt;s needs to be analyzed in more detail to fully confirm whether it has come from another galaxy. Molecular gas observations from radio telescopes and better resolution IFS observations will be very helpful in this pursuit!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Dimming of Betelgeuse: A Stellar Tipping Point?</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Great Dimming of Betelgeuse (alpha Orionis) in late 2019 puzzled astronomers across the globe. The star appeared the faintest in all its modern recorded history. The mystery mounted as it quickly regained brightness in the next few months, and showed interesting patterns of light variations post dimming. Previously, we had investigated the light curve of Betelgeuse from the perspective of nonlinear dynamics and time series analysis (George et al. 2020). We found signatures of a dynamical transition causing a permanent change in the pulsation dynamics of the star. Here, we discuss these results and present further evidence obtained by analysing multiwavelength data from the star, including visible and infrared radiation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to spot the constellation Orion in the summer night sky—it looks like a hunter or a shepherd with its waist (or belt) characterised by three stars in a straight line. The shoulder of Orion, Betelgeuse, varies in brightness irregularly, so much so that these variations are noticeable to the naked eye! It is therefore classified as a semiregular variable star—an object of fascination since ancient times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/Great_Dimming_Betelgeuse_sneha/image1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brightness of astronomical objects is measured in terms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude&quot;&gt;apparent magnitude&lt;/a&gt;: a reverse logarithmic scale to measure how bright the object appears from the Earth. The full moon registers at about -12.9 on this scale while the Sun is at -26.7. For &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_pulsation&quot;&gt;pulsating variable stars&lt;/a&gt;, this quantity changes periodically as the star repeats cycles of expansions and contractions. Some stars pulsate in a simple periodic manner (corresponding to the so-called fundamental frequency) while others show a more complicated pattern with interfering periods (or frequencies). These additional periods (or corresponding frequencies) can be identified using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aavso.org/sites/default/files/education/vsa/Chapter11.pdf&quot;&gt;complex analysis of the light curve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the light curve of Betelgeuse shows a primary period of ~425 days, a secondary period of ~5.9 years and a possible tertiary period of ~180 days. Following these periodicities, its visible brightness can usually go as high as 0.0 and as low as 1.3 in apparent magnitude. At 9 million years old, it is expected to go supernova in the next 100,000 years, and when it does, it will be a spectacular event in the night sky (if we survive until then). Perhaps for this reason, speculations of the impending supernova made headlines when an unprecedented dimming in the star was reported in late 2019 by Prof. Edward Guinan in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13341&quot;&gt;Astronomer’s Telegram&lt;/a&gt;. With a reported apparent magnitude of 1.5614, it was the faintest in its history of modern observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain the unprecedented event. These include formation of a dust cloud, gigantic star spots, or an overlapping of the primary and secondary periods. The observed dimming was later confirmed in Infrared as well &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ac19b5&quot;&gt;(Harper et al., 2021)&lt;/a&gt;, complicating the mystery because the greater part of its radiation actually belongs to the infrared/near-infrared spectrum. Now, like all stars, Betelgeuse emits radiation at all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, but the intensity at a given wavelength is governed by different factors. The surface temperature, for example, governs the peak observed in the thermal spectrum but there could be localised temperature changes on the surface (star spots), driven by large convection cells. Presence of dust and gas in the circumstellar environment affects the visible region and causes scattering in the UV. Any changes in pulsation also affects the different layers of the star, reflected as variations in different wavelengths. Moreover, these phenomena can happen together, further complicating the interpretation of observed radiation. In the context of Great Dimming of Betelgeuse, it therefore makes sense to ask whether it was a temporary, peripheral phenomenon (such as star spots or dust cloud), or something else, such as changes to the pulsation dynamics (which would likely affect the star as a whole). With this perspective, we investigated the light curve of the star prior to the dimming in all these wavelengths. We start by treating the star as a dynamical system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;multistable-dynamical-systems&quot;&gt;Multistable dynamical systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loosely speaking, a &lt;strong&gt;dynamical system&lt;/strong&gt; is one that evolves in time according to a set of predefined rules. Mathematically, it is a system whose behaviour in time is described by a set of differential equations, subject to some parameters and initial conditions (and external influences). Swinging pendula, celestial bodies in motion, population growth in ecosystems, neuronal synapses, etc., can all be studied as dynamical systems. Some of these systems can exist in one of many possible states. Such &lt;strong&gt;multi-stable&lt;/strong&gt; systems are very interesting and can serve as models of real systems. Let us understand them with the help of a toy model with two possible stable states as illustrated in figure 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/Great_Dimming_Betelgeuse_sneha/image3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 3: Schematic representation of a multistable dynamical system. It can be in any state on the curve depending on parameters and initial state, etc. But given enough time, it will occupy either of the stable states, A or B (indicated by the green ball).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when the system existing in state A is perturbed a little, it oscillates around and eventually settles to A. Alternatively, if initially in state B, and given some tiny perturbation, it will eventually settle back down to B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical transition in such a system refers to a sudden change in the state, leading to a contrasting dynamics. In our example, it would mean the system going from A to B (or vice-a-versa). The melting of sea ice in recent times and the historically green Sahara becoming a desert, are often cited as examples of such transitions. These transitions are notoriously difficult to anticipate because they happen suddenly. Such transitions are ubiquitous but most recognized in ecology, psychology, and climate. In recent decades, a whole body of literature has focused on the development of so-called &lt;em&gt;Early Warning Signals (EWS)&lt;/em&gt;, that detect such transitions well in advance. Most of these EWS rely on the assumption of &lt;em&gt;Critical Slowing Down&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;critical-slowing-down-and-ews&quot;&gt;Critical Slowing Down and EWS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us imagine that the structure (or stability landscape) from figure 3 is governed by a system parameter β. Increasing β makes the well corresponding to state A shallower, decreasing the system resilience in this state. Decreased resilience implies that any displacement from state A will now be endured longer, increasing correlation in time. This will also reflect in longer return times (captured in recurrence based quantifiers) and increased fluctuations, causing large variance. This phenomenon is commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;Critical Slowing Down (CSD)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 4: In normal conditions (left), small perturbations to the stable state A do not last long and fluctuations are small. But at higher values of system parameter β, the resilience of system in state A decreases, schematically illustrated here as a shallower structure (right). This results in large fluctuations in time (above, right) even with small perturbations, along with longer return times to the stable state.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a certain point, the system reaches a tipping point where the tiniest of disturbance can take the system to the alternate stable state, B. This is called &lt;strong&gt;bifurcation-induced tipping&lt;/strong&gt; (there also exist other types of tipping such as noise-induced tipping and rate-induced tipping, which are beyond the scope of discussion of this article). At this point, the resilience indicators show characteristic trends such as increase in statistical variance (due to perturbations persisting over long time), autocorrelation at lag-1 (correlation in the present state and immediate past state), increase in Hurst exponent (a measure of autocorrelations in the data over different time lags), etc. Similarly, longer return times cause systematic trends in recurrence-based quantifiers. Such trends indicate the existence of a tipping point and are therefore collectively known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.early-warning-signals.org/?page_id=480&quot;&gt;Early Warning Signals (EWS)&lt;/a&gt; of a dynamical transition. It can be noted that although the example discussed here is a very simple one, CSD and associated EWS have been applied in more nuanced contexts in different areas ranging from psychology, finance, ecology and climate change, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;critical-transition-in-betelgeuse&quot;&gt;Critical transition in Betelgeuse&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to Betelgeuse, we considered it as a dynamical system and analysed the light curve data collected by the The American Association of Variable Star Observers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aavso.org/&quot;&gt;(AAVSO)&lt;/a&gt;. We identified some of the EWS in this data prior to dimming. The process consists of taking subsequent windows (sections) of the light curve in a sliding fashion (i.e. with some overlap), moving a few data points at a time. Then, statistical measures for these windows are calculated and plotted against time, as shown in the figure 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/Great_Dimming_Betelgeuse_sneha/image5.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 5: Variation in the (a) Autocorrelation at lag 1 and (b) Variance calculated from the light curve of Betelgeuse upto the dimming (red), during the dimming (blue) and post dimming (green). The left panels (figures 1a and 1b) show the variation from 1990 onwards using a window size of 300 points on data binned every 10 days. The right panels zoom into a region around the dimming, with data binned every 5 days with a window size of 40. &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.aavso.org/webobs/results/?star=000-BBK-383&amp;amp;num_results=200&quot;&gt;Based on the data from AAVSO database&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, these measures rise prior to the dimming, and serve as strong evidence of a dynamical transition preceded by CSD. Now, we know that the variability in the light curve of Betelgeuse is primarily governed by pulsation. EWS in the data, therefore, hint at a transition affecting its pulsation dynamics. Of course, the credibility of these results relies on statistical significance (further details in the paper). However, there is another way we can verify the existence of a transition—by looking at the variation in other wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;variations-in-other-wavelengths&quot;&gt;Variations in other wavelengths&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The radiation of a star comprises of different components of the electromagnetic spectrum. These components originate due to different stellar processes. In the case of Betelgeuse, the greatest part of electromagnetic radiation is in the infrared. In fact, Betelgeuse is the brightest star in infrared as seen from Earth! Naturally, the variations in this part of the spectrum are highly relevant to understand the dynamics of Betelgeuse. The multiwavelength data discussed in the paper has been taken with permission from &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ac19b5&quot;&gt;Harper et al. (2021)&lt;/a&gt;. It consists of a simplified three-filter system devised by &lt;a href=&quot;https://adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1992JAVSO..21...42W&quot;&gt;Wing et al. (1992)&lt;/a&gt; for red variable stars. Wing A filter is dominated by the TiO 719 nm (narrow band) and the Wing B and C filters are continuum bands centred around 750 nm and 1024 nm respectively. These filters are carefully selected to measure the infrared magnitude, colour and the spectral type of the star. The primary use of this filter system is for estimating surface temperature of these stars. In addition, this data also includes measurements in the V-band centred around 555 nanometer (nm), that can be compared to the same region in the AAVSO data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is apparent from figure 6 that the dimming was simultaneous in all wavelengths! Further, we calculated the cross-correlation among these wavelengths, and found a systematic decrease before dimming as shown in figure 7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/Great_Dimming_Betelgeuse_sneha/image7.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
Figure 7: Pearson correlation coefficient calculated for each pair of wavelengths, indicated here in different colours. These correlations in time decrease prior to dimming.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dimming could be just a normal cycle of the star but brightness variations in the past have never been so extreme (within the limits of available data). Since the infrared radiation comes from deeper layers of the star, we conclude that the dimming was not a surface phenomena. Further, since the dimming was simultaneous in all bands, we can argue that it was related to a dynamical process that affected the whole star, making change in pulsation dynamics the natural answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-current-state-of-the-stellar-matter&quot;&gt;The current state of the (stellar) matter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the measurements post dimming seem to validate the dynamical transition. For example, the brightening of the star was almost as quick as the dimming, and the next seasonal cycle was ‘rounder’ than ever! Moreover, later studies found increased prominence of the ~180 day period. These observations suggest a permanent change to the pulsation dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Great Dimming of Betelgeuse continues to astonish us, even with all the new data we have from Hubble and other sources. Possibilities range from a dynamical transition or overlapping of periodic cycles, to a dust cloud or a large star spot, but (sadly) almost certainly not a supernova! Betelgeuse is a complex star—full of mystery—and we excitedly await to observe and understand more about it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How do astronomers understand the evolution of young stars in star clusters?</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This article is based on the paper published in the Journal of Astrophysics &amp;amp; Astronomy. The article shows the results of our deep optical photometric observations of a young cluster NGC 1893 taken with the 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope. Based on the optical data obtained with the data along with the Gaia data, we characterized the young stars in the central region of the cluster and determined their age, mass and membership. We found that the distribution of masses of young low-mass stars in the cluster is similar to that of other Galactic clusters.  Our analysis suggested a primordial mass segregation in the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stars form out of dense clouds made up of molecular gas and dust. A majority of these stars emerge as groups or clusters. Star clusters contain stars that are gravitationally stable against dispersion for reasonably long periods of time. Stars in a cluster have the same age and chemical composition (metallicity) but differ in mass and hence are found in different evolutionary stages, allowing astronomers to test stellar evolution theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent observational studies of nearby star-forming regions show that more than half of their young stars are associated with groups of ten or more stars. Therefore, young star clusters are crucial to understand the physical processes involved in the birth and evolution of stars and star clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/evolution_young_star_cluster_neelam/image1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Star clusters enable astronomers to place the stars of a wide range of masses within the Hertzsprung-Russel (HR) diagram that shows the relationship between a star’s temperature and its luminosity and infer their evolutionary stages and physical parameters, such as age, mass etc. The mass of a star is one of the most important factors providing constraint to its future evolution, but it is not clearly known what determines the exact mass of a newly forming star. One aspect of this problem is the knowledge of the distribution of stellar masses, initial mass function (IMF), in a star cluster.  However, the precise statistics for low-mass stars (stars smaller than the Sun) are somewhat uncertain as they are faint. The theoretical basis for the IMF, variation with the metallicity, environment etc., is challenged by the observational evidence for the universality of the IMF. With the sensitive instruments mounted on moderate size telescopes, e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu&quot;&gt;Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aries.res.in/facilities/astronomical-telescopes/360cm-telescope&quot;&gt;Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://subarutelescope.org/en/&quot;&gt;Subaru&lt;/a&gt; etc., that are capable of detecting fainter low-mass stars, now it is possible to shed light on the IMF of the cluster towards the very low-mass end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research work focuses on a young star cluster NGC 1893 from the New General Catalog (NGC was compiled by J. L. E. Dreyer in the year 1888 and contains about 7840 celestial objects mostly galaxies, nebulae and star clusters). In order to get more insights into the properties of the stars in a young cluster NGC 1893 (Fig. 1), Dr. Neelam Panwar and a team of astronomers of the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) in India performed photometric monitoring of this cluster. For this purpose, they employed the 4Kx4K Imager camera mounted on the 3.6-meter ARIES DOT.  Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF) software is used for image reduction and analysis. Various programs developed in Python and C++ programming languages are also used for data analysis and plotting. The optical data from DOT were deep enough to reveal very low-mass stars (about 0.2 times the mass of the Sun) in NGC 1893 (Fig. 2). The DOT data allowed the team to identify about 420 young stars in the central portion of the cluster, out of which 110 turned out to be new members. The study was complemented by archival data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia&quot;&gt;ESA’s Gaia&lt;/a&gt; satellite, a sample of young stars obtained using infrared data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://old.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/&quot;&gt;2MASS&lt;/a&gt;/ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/&quot;&gt;Spitzer space telescope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chandra.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;Chandra X-ray&lt;/a&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine the physical parameters of the cluster, it is essential to select the stars that are associated with the cluster. Since cluster members share nearly similar motion in the plane of the sky,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=I/350/gaiaedr3&quot;&gt;Gaia Early Data Release 3&lt;/a&gt; catalogue is used to select the kinematic members, i.e., stars having similar proper motion values and estimate the distance of the cluster using the mean parallax of the cluster members. The young cluster is found approximately 10,600 light years away from the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For faint stars (about V&amp;gt;20 mag which corresponds to about solar mass, as seen in the CMD for NGC 1893) there is higher uncertainty in the proper motion, parallax values.The kinematic information is accurate upto sun-like stars. As the cluster is young (with an age of less than 10 million years), its low-mass members are still contracting towards the main sequence. Hence, the low-mass cluster members are young stars for which the HR diagram (optical color-magnitude diagram) yields ages less than 10 million years. They also studied the mass distribution of the young low-mass stars in the cluster and found that it is similar to other young clusters, i.e., their results favour the idea of a universal IMF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observations of star clusters show that relatively massive stars are often found to be located toward the cluster centre. It is not well understood if this mass segregation is due to the dynamical evolution of the star cluster or if this is related to the star formation process itself. Their analysis also suggested that stars with masses above half of the solar mass are located toward the cluster centre as compared to the stars with masses lower than this limit, indicating primordial mass segregation in the young cluster&lt;/p&gt;
