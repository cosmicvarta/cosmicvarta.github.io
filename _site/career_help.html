<h4 id="want-to-pursue-a-career-in-astrophysics">Want to pursue a career in astrophysics?</h4>
<p>Well… astronomy and astrophysics is an exciting branch of physics isn’t it? There are plenty of options available for young people willing to choose a career in this discipline. While in India, there is not much emphasis on astrophysics as a subject right until you graduate, a wide variety of options open up after it.
During MSc., some universities have the choice of astrophysics as a specialization. Some universities provide an option of joining the various research institutes for the final year dissertation project. Places like IIA, IUCAA, ARIES, etc., offer people the opportunity to conduct short term projects in associations with a faculty member.
After MSc, if one is interested, one can apply for a Ph. D at these institutes. A Ph. D is the highest academic degree one can obtain and from hereon the formal work of an astrophysicist starts.</p>

<h4 id="want-to-pursue-a-ph-d-in-astronomy-in-india">Want to pursue a Ph. D in astronomy in India?</h4>

<p>If yes, this is the right place to seek the information about these things. We list all the institutes offering a Ph.D in astronomy and astrophysics in India.</p>

<h4 id="aries-nainital">ARIES, Nainital</h4>
<p>Situated adjacent to the picturesque hill town of Nainital, ARIES (an acronym of Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences) is one of the leading research Institutes which specializes in observational Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics and Atmospheric Sciences. The main research interests of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics division are in solar, planetary, stellar, galactic and extragalactic astronomy including stellar variabilities, X-ray binaries, star clusters, nearby galaxies, quasars, and inherently transient events like supernovae and highly energetic Gamma Ray Bursts. The Institute hosts several telescopes. The unique geographical position of ARIES (79<sup>0</sup> East), places it at almost in the middle of 180<sup>0</sup> wide longitude band, between Canary Island (20<sup>0</sup> West) and Eastern Australia (157<sup>0</sup> East), and therefore complements observations which might not be possible from either of these two places. ARIES has made unique contributions from time to time.
More information about the institute is available <a href="https://aries.res.in/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="iia-bengaluru">IIA, Bengaluru</h4>
