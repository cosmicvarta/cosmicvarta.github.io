    "body": " What is CosmicVarta?Astronomy is truly a global subject. The boundaries between the nations, people, ethnicities do not exist for astronomers. We all think of the entire humankind as one. Hence, it becomes necessary and a responsibility for professional astronomers to present a platform where the authentic research being carried out is presented and discussed in language which a non-expert individual can understand. Moreover, while high quality research is communicated through the reputed journals, the students who are not dealing with the subject on a day to day basis might find it difficult to grasp. We thought over this problem and came up with CosmicVarta as an online platform where we simplify the current astronomical research being carried out so that people from every background can grasp the essence of the results. CosmicVarta is intended to be a portal where the current research is presented in a simplified way and subsequently discussed by people so that everyone can have a glimpse into the exciting world of astronomical research. Through this portal, we will present reviews of recently published articles, interviews with the eminent scientists working in the field of astronomy and astrophysics all over India and also serve as a platform to discuss the research in a simplified manner. Research in astronomy is pursued at only a handful of research institutes, hence prospective students may often find it challenging to find relevant information. Through this portal you may find information regarding the various career options available, various positions available at astronomy institutes in India and other related information. This portal will also serve as an information hub regarding various softwares and databases that are available to be used by the public for free. We can even help students who are looking for short term projects using such a huge volume of data by connecting with the scientists working actively in that area of research. Come join us on a journey which will take you to the wonderful world of stars, galaxies and beyond; and feel enthralled by unlocking the keys to the mysteries of the universe which the scientists are doing on a daily basis. Who are we?We are a group of enthusiastic young researchers, mostly PhD scholars in astrophysics, who wish to make available lndian astronomy research to all interested minds. We keep a track of recent research papers published by lndian astronomers.

    "body": ": Would you like to write for us? Are you involved in astronomy and astrophysics research being conducted in India? Do you wish to share your research results in simple words? Do you want students and public in general to understand what you are working on?If you answer Yes to any of the questions, then CosmicVarta is the platform for you! We are looking for writers actively. Here, you can write about your recent research in simple words and hence, communicate it to the rest of the world. We usually accept articles based on recently accepted papers. Authors, who can review their own papers are most welcome to submit a popular verison of their papers, for wider audience and publicity. There is not fixed format as such, however we generally expect the articles to be short and concise which conveys the essence of the work, in a simplified language. While we accept only English language submissions at the moment, based on the audience and situation we may include articles in native languages in the future. Here are a few guidelines we expect authors to follow before submitting their articles::    The article should be a concise version of the recently accepted/published paper, intended for the general audience. We do not expect technical language. The articles will go through an editorial review by our team and the articles not meeting the criteria will generally need to be revised before being published here.   The submitted article must be about a paper accepted/published within the last 6 months only. However, we also accept review type papers, intended for the general audience, where this limit does not apply.   The submission here should not be published or being considered for publication elsewhere. The responsibility lies with the author to ensure that the article submitted here is original.   Figures are welcome in the article. However, the author has to ensure that the figures do not violate any copyright regulations and prior permisison is available in order to be used here. Note that figures available within arXiv often come with a Creative Commons (CC) license.   The authors will be contacted with a form where they may upload the article and related figures/other material. Do not forget to provide the link to the originally published/accepted paper.  Write for the purpose of visibility among the general masses and for the purpose of disseminating real research results of astronomy among young minds. If you would like to write for us, do fill up the form below and we will contact you. Join Us Our editing guidelines:: Editing an article is similar to reviewing a research paper. However, while a referee needs to primarily focus on the science aspect of the submitted manuscript, a CosmicVarta editor may relax some aspects of the science, since the paper in consideration has already been peer-reviewed. That being said, there are a few guidelines which the editor must follow, and try to incorporate while working with the author. These are listed below:    Each submission will be allotted an editor, who will be coordinating with the author in framing the article in a format suitable for being published at CosmicVarta.   The overarching goal of the editor is to “make the article simple, but not simpler”. That is, the article must be accessible to the reader without compromising on the scientific soundness of the published work by the author.   The general flow of logic in any article is expected to be:  General details and an introduction to global science: This is the most important part of the whole article, since it needs to enrapture and fascinate the reader on the science being done.   A narrower perspective stating the science question, and emphasizing on the importance of the science question: This section starts with the detailing of the subject, which finally leads to the science question being asked in the paper. By the end of this section, the reader must be able to appreciate the science question asked, and also the science studied to answer the same.   Methods and techniques: Generally, this section gets technical in a paper. The editor must ensure the techniques are explained as simply as possible, minimizing technical jargons and details directly irrelevant to the results. While the author may add footnotes for caveats and details, such sub-plots should not lead the reader astray from the science question asked.   Results, conclusions and future work: The author would generally have a tendency to present all the results and their interpretation while drafting the article. Hence, it is the editor’s responsibility to ensure the main results are highlighted well, put into correct local and global context. Other results which would need details may be left out, or hinted at towards the end for the more technical reader.   The editor may suggest graphics in the form of images/gifs to better convey the science, and must ensure these are of good quality (in resolution and science), and are attributed to the correct source(s).   The editor must note that the author’s presentation style may be very different from the editor’s. Since the article is the author’s baby, the editor must not enforce their style of presentation on the author.  Do you want to contribute in any other way?. : If you are passionate about science communication, but want to contribute in any other way, we will consider your request for this option as well. We are seeking people who can help in maintaining our web page as well as other activities related to the handling of articles on this portal. Do get in touch if you are interested in contributing!!! You may use the contact section or the email below for any queries/comments related to submission of articles or any other queries. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. "

    "body": "2023/07/13 -  India’s ambitious space program reaches new heights as Chandrayaan-3, the eagerly anticipated lunar exploration mission, prepares for launch. Get ready to witness history in the making as India embarks again on an extraordinary journey towards the Moon, marking a remarkable milestone for the nation and igniting a wave of excitement across the country.  Chandrayaan-3 is the planned 3rd lunar exploration mission by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), with the aim of demonstrating the end-to-end capability in safe landing and roving on the lunar surface along with the development and demonstration of new technologies intended towards inter-planetary missions. The developed system for the mission consists of an indigenous Lander module (Vikram), a Rover (Pragyan) and a Propulsion module.   Figure 1: A schematic illustration of the Integrated Module. Credits: ISRO The launcher identified for Chandrayaan-3 is LVM3-M4 (Launch Mark 3 - Mission 4), which will place the integrated module in an Elliptic Parking Orbit (EPO). The pri- mary function of the Propulsion module is to transport the Lander from the launch vehicle injection till its entry into the lunar polar orbit at an altitude of 100 kms from the lunar surface, after which the Lander separates from the Propulsion module and begins its descent. The Lander is equipped with the capability to perform a soft land at a specified lunar site (69. 367621 S, 32. 348126 E) and deploy the Rover which will then carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its planned lifetime of 14 Earth days (1 Lunar Day). The Propulsion Module also has one scientific payload as a secondary function which will be operated post separation of Lander module.    Figure 2: A schematic illustration of the Chandrayaan-3 Lander (Top) and Rover (Bottom). Credits: ISRO The mission objectives of Chandrayaan-3 are:  To demonstrate Safe and Soft Landing on Lunar Surface To demonstrate Rover roving on the moon To conduct in-situ scientific experimentsThe Propulsion module, the Lander and the Rover hosts a total of 7 scientific payloadsin order to carry out experiments on the lunar surface and atmosphere. They are listedbelow.  Radio Anatomy of Moon Bound Hypersensitive ionosphere and Atmosphere(RAMBHA) - [Lander] - This experiment makes use of a Langmuir Probe in order to measure the near surface plasma density and its changes with time.  Chandra’s Surface Thermo physical Experiment (ChaSTE) - [Lander] - To measure the thermal conductivity and temperature of the lunar surface.  Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA) - [Lander] - An experiment to measure the seismicity of the lunar surface and delineating the structure of the lunar crust and mantle.  Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA) - [Lander] - A passive experiment to understand the dynamics of Moon system.  Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) - [Rover] - To determine the elemental composition of the surface in the immediate vicinity of the landing site.  Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) - [Rover] - To infer the mineralogical composition of the lunar surface through elemental analysis.  Spectro-polarimetry of HAbitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) - [Propulsion module] - To observe the Earth in reflected light in an attempt to decipher future discoveries of Exo-planets which would qualify for habitability. Within the predecessors to the Chandrayaan-3, Chandrayaan-2 boasted a ‘significant technological leap’ compared to the Chandrayaan-1. The Vikram Lander onboard the Chandrayaan-2 accomplished its intended descent trajectory, smoothly transitioning from an orbit of 35 km to a position slightly below 2 km above the lunar surface. During this phase, all systems and sensors of the Lander operated flawlessly, demonstrating the successful utilization of groundbreaking technologies, such as the innovative variable thrust propulsion system. Unfortunately, communication with the Lander was lost during the final descent phase. Subsequent investigations confirmed that the lander experienced a hard landing on the lunar surface, resulting in the loss of the lander itself. Chandrayaan-3 aims to address the challenges of its predecessors and enhance the current understanding of the Moon. On successful landing at the specified site, India will immortalise herself as the fourth country to land its spacecraft on the surface of the Moon and the first country to land near the South Pole of the Moon. The launch of Chandrayaan-3 has been scheduled for July 14, 2023, at 2:35 pm IST from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. The spacecraft is expected to reach the moon by the 23rd − 24th August. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. "

    "title": "Investigating the massive plasma blobs from the Sun using an ‘in-situ’ eye",
    "body": "2023/07/03 -  This article is about investigating the characteristics of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections using in-situ observation. ICMEs are well-known to expand as they propagate through the heliosphere. Despite this, their cross-sections are usually modeled as static plasma columns within the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) framework. We test the validity of this approach using in-situ plasma data from 151 magnetic clouds (MCs) observed by the WIND spacecraft and 45 observed by the Helios spacecraft. We find that the most probable cross-section expansion speeds for the WIND events are only ≈ 0. 06 times the Alfvén speed inside the MCs, while the most probable cross-section expansion speeds for the Helios events is ≈ 0. 03. MC cross-sections can thus be considered to be nearly static over an Alfvén crossing timescale. Using estimates of electrical conductivity arising from Coulomb collisions, we find that the Lundquist number inside MCs is high (≈ 1013 to 1014), suggesting that the MHD description is well justified. The Joule heating rates using our conductivity estimates are several orders of magnitude lower than the requirement for plasma heating inside MCs near the Earth. While the (low) heating rates we compute are consistent with the MHD description, the discrepancy with the heating requirement points to possible departures from MHD and the need for a better understanding of plasma heating in MCs.  You might wonder what is in-situ and what are ICMEs. Don’t worry, I am here to guide youthrough this article. ‘CMEs’ or Coronal Mass Ejections are massive blobs of plasma along withstrong magnetic fields that erupt from the solar corona. Corona is the Latin word for ‘crown’ andit is the outermost layer of our Sun. It has nothing to do with the awful COVID pandemic. Due tothe presence of the bright photosphere (the bright yellow disk we see during daytime), we cannotsee the corona with our naked eyes. However, during a total solar eclipse, we can have a glimpseof it. Remember that beautiful aura encircled the sun during a total solar eclipse? Yes, that issolar corona (see Figure 1). It is extremely hot (temperature around a few million Kelvin (K)),much hotter than the photosphere (temperature ~ 6000 K). Why the corona is so hot, remains amystery to the solar astrophysicists. Throughout this article, you will encounter the word,‘plasma’. A plasma is a medium filled with charged particles and due to its higher conductivity,the charged particles often gyrate closely to the magnetic field lines present in that medium. Hence, the charged particles can follow the motion of the magnetic field. Although made ofcharged particles, the plasma can be overall neutral.   (Figure 1: Total solar eclipse during April 1999. Picture courtesy: Luc Viatour ) One of the most spectacular events that come out from this ever-changing dancing dynamics of corona is the CME. CMEs are the largest-scale eruptive phenomena in the solar system. The huge lump of plasma of mass 1013-1015 kg, accompanied with strong magnetic fields, is hauled up out of the corona all the way into the interplanetary space with a typical velocity ranging from several hundred to more than 1000 km per second. Due to their high velocities, CMEs are often accompanied by shocks in front of them. A typical CME has a kinetic energy of around 1022-1025 Joules. Broadly, CME observation methods can be divided into two categories: 1) remote observations and 2) in-situ observations. The first kind, as the name suggests, observes the CMEs from far away, usually when they come out of the Sun. We need to rely on the CME images as none of the spacecraft can go that much close to the Sun. This is because, as of now, we do not have the technology which can survive the extreme environment (the million K coronal temperature, the strong electromagnetic fields, the bombardment of highly accelerated charged particles, strong radiation hazards, etc. ) in the proximity of the Sun. One of the key techniques used in this method is the use of ‘coronagraphs’. A coronagraph acts like an artificial total solar eclipse by blocking the bright solar disk so that we can observe the dynamics of the CME while it is getting ejected out into the interplanetary space. Figure 2 shows two coronagraph images of a CME on February 27, 2000, observed by the Large Angle and Spectrometric COronagraph (LASCO) instrument on board the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) , a joint mission by NASA and ESA. The left panel is an image from the C2 coronagraph with a field of view (FOV) of 2. 2 - 6. 0 R⊙ (R⊙ is the radius of the Sun) and the right panel is from the C3 coronagraph with FOV from 3. 7 to 30 R⊙. In both images, the inner circle represents the Sun while the outer circle signifies the occulter of the coronagraph.   Figure 2: The coronagraph image of a CME eruption. Image courtesy: LASCO instrumentaboard SOHO When the CME travels through the interplanetary space, it expands and interacts with the solar wind. In the propagation phase, CMEs are often called ‘Interplanetary CMEs’ or ICMEs. Due to its humongous size and low plasma density during this phase, it becomes almost impossible to capture the entire ICME using any imaging technique. Here the second method, the in-situ observation, becomes useful. In this method, the spacecraft passes through the ICME cross-section and directly measures the important parameters of a propagating ICME. During its propagation, the plasma entangled with the smooth and twisted magnetic field lines (which resemble the telephone cord) forms a huge cloud-like structure known as the Magnetic Cloud or MC. Figure 3 shows a cartoon describing an MC associated with an ICME as it travels through interplanetary space. An example of the in-situ data measured close to 1 astronomical unit (The distance between the Sun and the Earth is called 1 astronomical unit or AU. It is approximately 15 crore km) by the WIND spacecraft as shown in Figure 4.   Figure 3: A cartoon diagram of a magnetic cloud associated with an ICME. This article aims at understanding the ICME expansion and heating (using in-situ observation) during their propagation through the interplanetary space by asking three questions:  How Good Is the Static Assumption for ICMEs? How Good is the Ideal MHD Assumption for ICMEs? Can Joule Heating Meet the Heating Budget of ICME plasma?All three questions are addressed in detail in their respective paragraphs.   Figure 4: An example of the in-situ data from the WIND spacecraft.  The spacecraft measures the parameters (total magnetic field (B), magnetic field components (Bx,By,Bz), proton number density (Np), plasma beta (β), etc. ). The plasma beta is the ratio between gas pressure (Pgas,) and magnetic pressure (Pmag,). The vertical lines depict the width of the MC. Though it is evident from the observations that ICMEs do expand (i. e. , their cross-sectionsincrease with time) as they propagate through the heliosphere, a lot of studies (Lundquist(1951),Burlaga (1988), Möstl et al. , 2009; Isavnin, Kilpua, and Koskinen, 2011) assumed the ICMEcross-sections to be ‘static plasma columns’! (In simpler words, it means the plasma inside theICMEs are at rest. ) This is because this assumption leads to the magnetohydrostatic (it is similarto hydrostatic equilibrium which is a certain type of equilibrium used for fluids when they are atrest, the only difference is, it is used for a plasma, not for a regular fluid) equilibrium. We knowthat physicists love equilibrium as it makes mathematical computations a lot easier. So, thoughwe all know that the ICME cross-sectional expansion speed is never strictly zero, it is assumed tobe zero (the scientists assumed that the expansion speed is very small) and hence we get theequilibrium. But no one to date has ever investigated the validity of this approximation. And so,in the first part of this study, we are aiming at the question: How Good Is the Static Assumption for ICMEs? For that, we compare the cross-sectional expansion speed (vexp) of MCs with the Alfven speed (vA)inside them. Alfven speed is the measure of the propagation of the magnetic perturbationsperpendicular to the magnetic field. We know that the sound speed of a medium is thecharacteristic speed of that particular medium. Similarly, is one of the characteristic speeds ofthe plasma. If vexp is sufficiently smaller than vA, or in other words, if the Alfven crossing timescale is much smaller than the cross-sectional expansion timescale, the magnetostatic assumption can beconsidered to be approximately valid inside the propagating ICMEs. We have taken a largesample of well-observed ICMEs: 151 events close to the Earth (using the data from the WINDspacecraft close to 1 AU) and 45 events in the interplanetary space between the Sun and theEarth (using the Helios data from 0. 29 AU to close to 1 AU). We estimate RA, the ratio between vexpand vA and found that the most probable values of are of RA the order of 0. 01. The statistical resultsare described in Figure 5. Our findings show that the ICME cross-sections can be assumed to bestatic (to a fairly good extent) over an Alfven crossing timescale.     Figure 5: Histograms of RA: the top panel shows the results for the WIND events while the bottom panel shows the results for the Helios events. Solar astrophysicists use a fluid-like prescription for plasma dynamics; it is known as magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The conventional treatment assumes that the CME plasma obeys the ideal MHD, i. e. , the magnetic field never diffuses and remains attached with the plasma particles. However, this assumption, too, had not been verified earlier. In the second part of our study, we ask: How Good is the Ideal MHD Assumption for ICMEs? The estimation of the Lundquist number (S0) is one way to do this. S0 is the ratio between the magnetic diffusion timescale (t𝜂) and the Alfven crossing timescale (𝑡𝐴). For the ideal MHD condition, t𝜂 (which means that the magnetic fields take infinite time to diffuse, in other words, they never diffuse), implying 𝑆0. So, the larger the magnitude of S0, the more the plasma will follow the assumptions of the ideal MHD. We have found that S0 is significantly large inside the ICME plasma (≅1013 ), suggesting a good justification for the use of the ideal MHD approximations (see Figure 6) to describe the motion of the ICMEs.     Figure 6: Histograms of S0: the top panel shows the results for the WIND events while the bottom panel shows the results for the Helios events. So far, we have seen that the ICME plasma fairly obeys the assumptions of the ideal MHD. However, there is a cache! The ideal MHD assumes zero heating of the plasma. But numerous observations confirm that the temperature of the near-Earth ICME can reach as high as ≅105K! Hence, the ideal MHD framework cannot explain the heating of CME plasma. Joule heating is the simplest type of heating mechanism we can investigate. In the last part of this study, we ask: Can Joule Heating Meet the Heating Budget of ICME plasma?To answer this question, we have evaluated the Joule heating (which is like the 𝐼2𝑅 heating inside an electrical wire, where I is the current and R is the resistance of the wire) rate inside all the ICMEs in our sample. We have found that the Joule heating rate (which we have found to be ≅10-6𝐽𝑘𝑔-1𝑠-1) is significantly smaller than the required heating budget (≅103𝐽𝑘𝑔-1𝑠-1) of the CME plasma. It proves that the Joule heating is not the right candidate for CME heating! One needs to look for another heating mechanism. CME thermodynamics is one of the most exciting topics under solar astrophysics and to date, no one knows the exact mechanism of CME heating. There are important approaches like, whether the CMEs are expanding adiabatically or getting heated isothermally via the thermal conduction from the solar corona, or whether turbulence plays a role in the local heating of CME plasma. But overall, this remains an unsolved mystery. You might wonder why we are so bothered about these giant plasma blobs. The reason is, Earth-directed ICMEs are the primary drivers of strong geomagnetic storms leading to space weather disturbances.  Such disturbances affect a wide range of technologies and communication systems we rely on. Starting from the damage to satellites, telecommunication systems, GPS, and electrical power supply to the radiation hazards on the human body. These disturbances can also cause red alerts for the astronaut’s safety. In order to mitigate these effects, we need to predict the arrival times and other important information (such as the strength and rotation of the magnetic field, ICME speed, their energy, etc. ) of these ICMEs as realistically as possible. To do that, a good understanding of the CMEs is crucial. With the launch of the Aditya L1 mission, which is India’s first mission dedicated to solar astronomy, we hope to have a new milestone in the advancement of CME research.

    "title": "'Where’s the Shadow?' - A workshop in preparation for Zero Shadow Day",
    "body": "2023/05/11 -  The Cosmology Education and Research Training Centre (COSMOS) is an upcoming state-of-the-art planetarium, along with a data training centre and resource centre in Mysuru. The Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) has formed an Education and Public Outreach Committee (EPOC) for COSMOS. In this article, the author has given a brief account of a unique workshop organised for both students and parents in preparation for Zero Shadow Day (ZSD). The article also highlights the various factors involved in a science outreach activity.  The Cosmology Education and Research Training Center (COSMOS) is an upcoming state-of-the-art planetarium along with a data training centre and resource center in Mysuru. The planetarium will come up at the Sri Jayachamaraja Wadiyar Center for Higher Learning (JWCHL) campus of the University of Mysore (UoM) at the foot of Chamundi Hill in Mysuru. The project is funded by the MPLAD funds of Hon’ble FM Nirmala Sitharaman, the Department of Science and Technology and the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India. The project is steered by the Principal Scientific Advisor, Government of India, and is managed by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, under an MoU between the University of Mysore and the Indian Institute of Astrophysics. The Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) has formed an Education and Public Outreach Committee (EPOC) for COSMOS consisting of science communicators and researchers across the country. IIA has hired two employees who are posted at Mysuru, who work to ensure the successful implementation of the outreach activities. The author is the Project Associate who coordinates all outreach activities on the ground. A Project Assistant has also been hired for a project to locate, digitise, and analyse astronomy content in Kannada. Both of them work in coordination with the EPO committee. This year’s Zero Shadow Day was the first one for “COSMOS”. The outreach team of COSMOS, in association with the IIA, the University of Mysore (UoM), and Kutulali, came up with the idea of organising a workshop in preparation for Zero Shadow Day for the school students and their parents. Some people might be wondering, Why parents? In fact, that’s a valid question to ask! Considering the modern-day trends of parents getting involved in the activities of their children at school, music class, dance, karate, etc. , we thought, why not give them a chance to involve themselves actively in a workshop? So, we sent out the posters to very few WhatsApp groups, asking interested people to register for the workshop and mentioning the fact that one of the parents should accompany the student on the day of the workshop. Interestingly, the response was overwhelmingly positive, with registrations from neighbouring cities and parents expressing their eagerness to attend the workshop over phone calls. I should also mention the fact that because it was the summer holidays and the state election was around the corner, we could not access teachers and schools to participate in the workshop. The workshop was held on April 17, 2023, at Vijnana Bhavan, University of Mysore, Mysuru. The program began with a talk by Ravinder Banyal, Associate Professor, IIA, on the necessity of studying the ‘Sun’ and then he discussed topics such as the various activities of the sun’s atmosphere, the formation of the sun, space weather, etc. Dr. Banyal successfully captured the attention of both parents and students by discussing the various topics in a language that they could comprehend. This was followed by a talk by Niruj Mohan Ramanujam on the science behind Zero Shadow Day. He went a step ahead and invited the students to the dias to involve them actively in the various aspects of the talk. Mr. Kollegala Sharma, PI-Kutuhali, who is a famous science writer and communicator in Kannada, was also present in the workshop and helped us reach the students and the parents in the local language, which is indeed a very important aspect of science communication in our country. Then we took the students and parents to the terrace of Vijnana Bhavan to do hands-on experiments. To be precise, this was the real-action time of the workshop.     Image 1: Dr. Ravinder Banyal (on left) and Mr. Kollegala Sharma (on right) interacting with the participants. [PC: Amoghavarsha. N] We had arranged three important experimental setups for the kids. The first one was a projection of the sun’s image onto the wall with the help of two IIA-made 4-inch reflector-type telescopes. The second one was finding the length of the shadow made by the Gnomon (Sanskrit/Kannada: Shankhu Yantra). The third and final one was the ball-mirror experiment. To our surprise, parents were engaging themselves in all the activities and experiments, matching the enthusiasm of an 8-year-old kid who was the youngest participant in our workshop!    Image 2: Dr. Niruj Mohan Ramanujam explaining the science behind Zero Shadow Day to the young participants. [PC: Dr. Chrisphin Karthik] With the above three experimental setups, the participants could witness important scientific phenomena, which are mentioned below.  Observation of Sunspots: The students were given a chance to fiddle with the telescopes (of course, with proper instructions) to try and get an image of the sun on the screen. After proper focusing, sunspots were visible, and students had fun counting the number of spots.  Movement of the Earth: As soon as the image was projected onto a screen, some students very distinctively noticed the movement of the sun’s image without any disturbance in the set-up. This helped in having a productive discussion regarding the earth’s movement around the sun.  Angular Size of the Sun: Students and parents were briefed on how to calculate the angular separation of the sun in the sky by measuring the diameter of the circle of the sun’s projection.  Solar Energy: Some small kids picked up some waste paper and placed it in front of the eyepiece to observe the phenomenon of the conversion of solar energy to heat energy. They were very happy when they were able to completely burn the paper.  True North of Earth: With the help of Gnomon, the students were asked to note down the length of the shadow made by Gnomon every 10 minutes. The shortest shadow was observed at the local noon, and kids reported to us that after that point the shadow’s direction changed (you should know “why?”)! Using the points touching the concentric circles and drawing perpendicular to one of those circles, they could convince themselves that what they had found out was indeed the true direction of ‘North’. Please refer to image 4 for more details.    Image 3: The participants measuring the length of the shadow made by the Gnomon (Shankhu Yantra) [PC: Ms. Bhavani Joshi]    Image 4: Finding the true north of Earth using Shankhu Yantra / the method of equal altitudes [Credits: The Sundial Primer] The program concluded with a wonderful feedback session from both the parents and students. The participants were also informed about the past and future activities of ‘COSMOS’ in and around the city before the dispersal. The Zero Shadow Day for Mysuru was on 23rd April 2023 at 12. 22 PM. I think I should also mention the fact that most of the experiments that were done on the workshop day were low-cost, self-made ones (which made me run very often to the local stationary shops), unlike the usual fancy stuff. For example, the Gnomon was a pencil which was glued to a thermocol (Polystyrene) sheet. I feel that (and I assume most of the people who are reading this will agree with me on this) we should encourage and promote more and more low-cost and self-doable experimental arrangements to be relevant to all sections of students and people in society. It must be realised that science communication and outreach activities are much more than putting a presentation through a projector! And also, doing science-related activities in non-metropolitan cities, rural areas, and remote places takes much more effort compared to those done in metropolitan cities due to various degrees of constraints.     Image 5: Participants doing the Ball-mirror experiment [PC: Ms. Bhavani Joshi] I would like to thank Dr. Niruj Mohan Ramanujam, SCOPE Head, IIA, for giving me enough freedom, constant support, and new ideas to carry out science communication and public outreach activities in Mysuru under the ‘COSMOS’ and IIA roofs. I also thank Prof. Annapurni Subramaniam, Director, IIA, for her encouragement and support. I must thank my friends and colleagues, Mr. Vikranth Pulamathi (SCOPE Associate, IIA), Mr. Vishaak K. B. (Intern at SCOPE, IIA), Mr. Punith. R. (Project Assistant, COSMOS), Ms. Bhavani (Intern at COSMOS, IIA), and all the volunteers of ‘COSMOS’ in Mysuru.

Frontiers in Cosmology saw a participation from over 100 subject experts including researchers, scientists, students and faculties and turned out to be a global platform to discuss, deliberate and share the latest from the field. The conference offered five broad themes - Inflation and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionisation, Low Redshift Cosmology, the Evolving Universe and the Next Generation Experiments. Young researchers used this platform to showcase the findings of their research, the best 25 posters were on display here. The conference hosted varied talks on CMB, characterization of galactic foregrounds, instrumentation, future astronomical facilities like the Simons Observatory, a ground-based CMB experiment located at Cerrro Toco in Chile, the Thirty Metre Telescope (TMT), the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), PRATUSH, some of which has active participation of RRI. Engaging and enlightening the audience about the telescope facilities like the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the BICEP Array telescopes – both located in Antarctica – SARAS, CHIME, the young students got a flavour of the facilities, both existing and upcoming. The event saw serious deliberations revolving the ever-growing challenges faced by the astronomy community in getting land free from light pollution and human interferences. Experts stressed on the need for building improved instrumentation facilities and technological support besides designing facilities on larger and collaborative basis. One of the speakers, Akito Kusaka, who spoke on ‘CMB – challenges and future prospects’, elaborated on the perfect conditions for installing the CMB detectors in the world. Further, his address highlighted the leakage of observations into polarization as one of the biggest hurdles in measuring CMB. The theories and scientific contributions of late Shivaramakrishnan Pancharatnam, (a noted student of Sir Raman), continue to be relevant even today, acknowledged Kusaka. Giving elaborate details, contributions and challenges of operating, Maclean Rouble, in her talk titled ‘S&amp;T of SPT : Past, Present and Future’, underlined the need for having sensitive detectors in order to improve the CMB mapping efforts. She touched upon the likely possibilities of telescopes post the operations of SPT, including the mm-line intensity mapping and the idea of developing kinetic inductance detectors. Another operational telescope in the Southern polar region is the BICEP Array telescopes, which are small aperture telescopes deployed to measure CMB with highest precision. Ritoban Basu Thakur in his talk informed about the heightened capacities of the upgraded BICEP Array telescope. NenuFAR and the CoDEX Program initiated by the European Research Council were discussed. Josh Dillon’s address on ‘Recent progress in 21cm Cosmology with the hydrogen epoch of reionization array’ detailed on the necessity for co-designing compact instruments with greater sensitivity for effective measurements. Nichole Barry elaborated on the difficulties in taking observations and working at the Murchison Widefield Array, especially for the epoch of reionization science in her address titled ‘The dangers of Whitefield Observations for the EoR 21cm measurements’. Introducing the SARAS experiment setup ‘Constraining high redshift astrophysics with SARAS’, by Saurabh Singh enlisted the multiple challenges, especially the bright foregrounds, and the shrinking radio-quiet zones in India for conducting continued observations. Introducing capabilities of CHIME, HIRAX and CHORD facilities, Shiv Sethi’s talk ‘Detecting HI in the post-reionizaiton’ suggested two potentially strong methods – stacking and cross-correction – that can produce good observations within the redshift 0. 3 – 1. 4 range. Hamsa Padmanabhan’s talk ‘A multi-messenger view of the baryonic Universe out to the Epoch Reionization’ underlined the requirement for strengthening the cross-co-relations for improving the 21cm HI intensity mapping in future.

Credits: RRI At a time when the country is sealing its position in Astronomy, senior scientists used this stage to inform the young attendees about the many next generation astronomy facilities, where India has major stakes. Yashwant Gupta spoke about the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and presented an insight into the world’s largest radio telescope, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Another mega-science project participated by India, the Thirty Metre Telescope (TMT) – the proposed largest optical telescope – was spoken during a session by GC Anupama. She narrated the the numerous hardships faced in erecting the telescope at the designated Mauna Kea in Hawaii and years of continued efforts to locate a search alternate site, all for science!

The three-day seminar aimed to provide postgraduate and motivated undergraduate students with insights and knowledge on current developments in Astronomy and Astrophysics under the ICARD activities. There is a dearth of conferences and seminars specifically tailored to meet the needs of undergraduate and postgraduate students. In light of this, a seminar has been thoughtfully planned to give students a unique opportunity to showcase and present their research work on an exclusive platform. It provided attendees with a comprehensive and interactive learning experience, featuring talks by prominent scientists, student contributions, and hands-on data analysis sessions. The students’ contributory talks were based on projects completed or currently in progress during their UG/PG programmes. The seminar saw active participation from over 40 students from different Institutes and Universities who were selected based on the submitted abstracts. Proceedings for Day OneThe Inaugural session of the seminar was presided over by Dr Fr Jose CC, honourable Pro-Vice Chancellor, CHRIST (Deemed to be University). The chief guest for the occasion was Dr Annapurni Subramaniam, Director Indian Institute of Astrophysics. They shared great insight into the need and multifold applications of the field of astronomy in day-to-day life. After a brief tea break, Dr Annapurni gave a plenary talk on “Astronomy from the ground and space-based telescopes”. The talk narrated the transition of astronomy from using the position of stars to navigate the night sky to using telescopes to unveil star formation in far-off galaxies. Attendees learned about accessing data from various space missions and using it for scientific purposes. They were also introduced to the country’s present and future space telescopes facilities, such as AstroSat and INSIST. The talk also briefly outlined the research works of the team led by Dr Annapurni. Dr Ajith Parmeswaran, ICTS, Bangalore, delivered the second plenary talk. The topic was “Gravitational wave astronomy: A new window to the Universe”. Dr Ajith participated virtually in the seminar. The talk focussed on how the observational confirmation of gravitational waves has enabled us to understand our Universe better. Participants were introduced to the precise instruments to detect and study these waves. The discussion also included information on CMB Bharat, a consortium for Indian cosmology, and LIGO India, allowing for a new perspective on comprehending the cosmos. The Seminar then had 12 talks by the participants in extragalactic and stellar astronomy. The audience received the talks well, leading to many fruitful discussions. The first day concluded with informal discussions with the participants and resource persons. Proceedings for Day TwoThe second day began with a plenary talk by Dr Shyama Naredranath, URSC, Bangalore. The topic was “Exploration of the Moon: paradigm shifts”. The talk discussed various theories that explain the origin of the Moon. The talk also narrated how the abundance of different volatile elements like sodium and oxygen will enable us to understand the formation scenario of the Moon. Dr Shyama also talked about India’s significant contribution to understanding the Moon, namely Chandrayaan 1 and 2. Dr Manoj Puravankara, TIFR, Mumbai, delivered the second plenary talk. The title of the talk was “Exploring the invisible Universe: the story of Infrared Astronomy”. Dr Manoj joined the seminar online. The talk discussed the importance of infrared astronomy and how the field has helped us unravel the Universe that lies shrouded in the visible spectrum, such as the interstellar shocks, protoplanetary disks, and reddening due to interstellar dust, among others. The talk also highlighted the new age space telescope, JWST, and how the telescope has helped us achieve great insights into the far ends of the Universe. Dr Manoj then discussed his team’s research using the JWST facility. Dr Dipanjan Mukherjee, IUCAA, Pune, delivered the third plenary talk on “Understanding how jets from Supermassive Black Holes affect galaxy evolution”.  The talk started with the galaxy colour-magnitude diagrams and the three distributions seen: the blue cloud, the red sequence and the green valley. Then, various quenching mechanisms prevalent in galaxies were discussed. The talk then highlighted how the jets emanating from black holes influence the evolution of the host galaxies. After the lunch break, the seminar had a series of five cosmology and space science talks by the student participants. Discussions with the panel and audience gave more significant insights into their research. A hands-on session on astronomical tools such as SAO DS9 and Topcat was scheduled next. The session was taken by Mr Akhil Krishna and Mr Suman Bhattacharya, PhD Scholars, CHRIST (Deemed to be University). The participants enthusiastically learnt to utilise these tools to visualise and analyse data from worldwide astronomical facilities. The participants were then led on a campus tour. They were introduced to the various facilities available in the University, including the Research and Development block and the different instruments such as the X-ray diffractometers, Electron Microscopy, UV- Visible spectrometer, Fluorometer, Microwave Synthesizer, Solar Simulator, and SEM, among others which the students can make use of. The last event for the day was a public talk by Dr Dipankar Bannerjee, Director, ARIES, Nainital. The lecture title was “India’s first Space Solar Observatory: Aditya L1”. The talk focussed on coronal mass ejections and sunspots. Dr Dipankar also discussed the upcoming first solar space mission from India, Aditya L1, and the various instruments to study our closest star. The mission’s main objective is to understand the coronal heating and solar wind acceleration, initiation of the coronal mass ejection, flares and near-Earth space weather, the coupling and dynamics of the Solar Atmosphere, and the solar wind distribution and temperature anisotropy. Proceedings for Day ThreeThe third day began with a plenary talk by Dr Smitha Subramanian, IIA, Bangalore, on “An introduction to extragalactic astronomy”. The talk started with the Great Debate: Shapley-Curtis debate. The participants were then introduced to Hubble’s tuning fork diagram and the various types of galaxies known to us.

    "title": "Why do some Active Galactic Nuclei Change their Look?",
    "body": "2023/04/13 -  An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is powered by the matter accreting onto the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the centre of a galaxy. Changing look (CL) AGNs are those sources that show rapid change in the column density of the X-ray absorber. CLAGNs show a complex shape in their X-ray spectra. The physical mechanisms responsible for these variations are unclear to date. In this article, we took an attempt to explain the CL phenomena on AGN and their possible origin. For that, we studied the spectral properties of NGC 1365 using joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations. We used JeTCAF model to fit the X-ray spectra of the source. We found that the variable absorption column density correlates with the mass accretion rate and the geometry of the corona. The derived wind velocity was sufficiently low compared to the escape velocity to drive the wind away from the disk for the epochs during which column densities were high. This suggests that the high and variable absorption can be due to failed winds from the disk. Our study construed that the changing accretion rate, which is a fundamental physical quantity and the geometry of the corona are driving the CL phenomena in NGC 1365. The physical picture of this work connects both variable continuum and variable absorbing medium scenarios. Moreover, from the spectral fitting of the joint data, we found the mass of the central black hole to be constant 4. 38 ± 0. 34−4. 51 ± 0. 29 × 106 Msun , in accord with the optical observations.  Beyond the visible stars that we see in the night sky, there is a hidden zoo of strange astronomical objects that are only visible as signals through high-tech telescopes in multiwavelengths from radio to gamma rays. Some are even Black Holes They are extremely dense, with such a strong gravitational attraction that not even light can escape their grasp. Therefore, black holes seem black! But the light which is coming from the accretion disk makes them visible through different telescopes. Small black holes populate the universe, but their cousins, supermassive black holes, dominate. These enormous black holes are millions or maybe even billions of times as massive as the sun. Scientists aren’t certain how such large black holes spawn. Once these giants have formed, they gather mass from the dust and gas around them, material that is plentiful in the center of galaxies, allowing them to grow to even more enormous sizes. When such an active supermassive black hole is sitting at the center of a galaxy and illuminating the whole galaxy is called an active galactic nucleus or an AGN. They can launch energetic jets and winds and emit radiation in different wavelengths.  AGNs have an endless supply of fuel, allowing them to power the jets. The accretion of hot gas and dust from the host galaxy is one of the sources of such a seemingly unlimited fuel supply. Not all AGNs appear similar to each other. They are classified depending on the presence or absence of jets, jet morphology, width of emission lines, luminosity, and the orientation in which these AGNs are viewed from the Earth. Depending on either the viewing angle or some intrinsic difference in structure, they can be classified into different spectral types. AGNs not only differ from one another but also change their flux and spectral type drastically in a timescale of hours to decades in both X-ray and optical/UV energy bands, which is why they are often called Changing Look AGNs. What makes them change their appearance has been the subject of much debate recently; however, two main processes are hypothesized to bring about this change: Changing Look due to obscuration and Changing Look due to change in state. We often see stars twinkling on a moderately cloudy night. This twinkling behavior is observed due to the irregular movements of clouds in the atmosphere, which changes the amount of brightness seen in stars from time to time through time-dependent obscuration along the line of human sight. Changing obscuration AGNs also have a similar reason for changing their appearance. They show intense time-dependent variability of the line-of-sight intervening gas density/column density, primarily associated with clouds or outflows eclipsing the AGN. Change in the appearance of AGNs due to obscuration is observed mainly in the X-ray wavelength regime. Obscuration by neutral intervening gas can leave a clear imprint on the X-ray emission observed in AGN. At a high column density, obscuration becomes significant enough to suppress the primary continuum of X-rays and produce a secondary continuum through reflections within the gas. Such variations are typically observed in X-Rays as the region which makes these X-rays are small enough to be concealed by the neighboring gases.  Changes in gas densities that cause obscuration are driven by intrinsic AGN luminosity variations, which have an impact on the chemical state of the material. A higher AGN luminosity chemically modifies the obscuring material to become more transparent to X-rays and thereby allows a decrease in line-of-sight column density. Apart from neutral gas obscuration, absorbing gas usually associated with outflows can also strongly affect the X-ray spectrum and is routinely recorded by the detector.

Credit: arXiv:2107. 13808.  Changing look due to change in state in AGN may arise due to several processes. They are usually observed in the UV/Optical regime due to variability in the accretion phenomenon. In many cases, they can be separated from Changing Obscuration AGN, when a Change in the look of AGN happens in close succession to a change in some intrinsic property of black hole accretion. One such case is a failed wind scenario. Instabilities like thermal or magnetic instabilities can heat up the disk and cause variations in the disk surface temperature and density and thereby making chemical changes in the disk, which directly affects the X-ray radiation. Other events include tidal disruption events, where a star gets close to a black hole and gets torn apart by it. In the process, the debris of the dead star disrupts the gas in the accretion disk of the black hole, which in turn changes the accretion rate and significantly affects the disk along with the X-ray corona, which disappears after a point. Observations do see such effects in different wavebands. In our study, we attempted to make a bridge between two main mechanisms, the intrinsic variability in the spectrum and the obscuration along the line of sight. For that purpose, we have analyzed a joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR satellites’ data of the source NGC 1365 (shown in the left panel of Fig. 1). Here, we briefly explain the data analysis procedures and spectral fitting techniques. Data AnalysisWe used joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of NGC 1365 during 2012 and 2013.  To analyze the XMM-Newton data, we used the Science Analysis System (SAS) version 19. 1. 0 and followed the standard procedures given in the SAS data analysis threads. We first reprocessed the Observation Data Files (ODF) using the epproc routine to generate the calibrated and concatenated event lists. We filtered the concatenated event lists to remove the periods of high background activity. Furthermore, we extracted the source and background spectra using the evselect routine. We used a circular region with a radius of 32′′ for both the source and the background. We used rmfgen and arfgen tasks to generate the redistribution matrices (. rmf) and the ancillary (. arf) files. Finally, we rebinned the spectra using the task specgroup in order to have at least 25 counts in each bin. The NuSTAR data were extracted using the standard NUSTARDAS version 1. 3. 12 software. We ran a nupipeline task to produce cleaned event lists and nuproducts to generate the spectra. We used a region of 80′′ for the source and 100′′ for the background using ds9. The data were grouped by grppha command, with a minimum of 30 counts in each bin. For the analysis of each epoch of observation, we used the data of both XMM-Newton and NuSTAR in the energy range of 0. 5−75 keV. We used XSPEC version 12. 11. 0 for spectral analysis. Model FittingEach epoch of observation was fitted using an accretion-ejection-based JeTCAF model (see Right panel of Fig. 1). This model requires six parameters (if the mass is considered as a free parameter), which are (i) the mass of the BH, (ii) the disc accretion rate, (iii) the halo accretion rate, (iv) the size of the dynamic corona or the location of the shock, (v) the shock compression ratio, and (vi) the ratio of the solid angle subtended by the outflow to the inflow. We directly run this model in NASA’s XSPEC software using initpackage command. Initially, we need to give some guess values of the parameters, then the fitting using the iterative method tries to find the best-fit values by minimizing the chi-square. Along with JeTCAF, we used the two-component absorption model (z)TBABS (Wilms et al. 2000) for both host galaxy and our Galaxy contributions, keeping the Galactic hydrogen column density (NH) fixed to 1. 3 × 1022 cm-2 . We used chi-square statistics for the goodness of the fitting. A representative fit using JeTCAF is shown in Figure 2. The model-fitted parameters show that NH along the line of sight decreases with mass accretion rate. Using this dependence and considering that the central radiation is illuminating the disk, therefore, the outflow is launching, we have estimated the mass outflow velocity, which is less than the escape velocity of the outflows. This suggests that the winds or outflows that cannot go away from the gravitational well of the BH are blocking the central radiation and may cause the changing look phenomena.   Figure 2: A representative best fit JeTCAF model spectrum of NGC 1365 in the 0. 5-75 keV energy band. Different emission and absorption lines are clearly visible. A strong excess below 2 keV energy is also evidenced. As an additional test, we used photoionization simulation using CLOUDY to predict absorption and emission line spectra for the modeled intrinsic spectral energy distribution in JeTCAF. The gas properties used in CLOUDY are taken from JeTCAF model fitting. The simulated spectra for all epochs are shown in Figure 3. The red and blue lines correspond to the ionization parameter (ξ) = 100 and 1000 erg cms-1, respectively. The micro-turbulence of vturb= 1000 km s-1 is used in the simulations for all epochs. The CLOUDY simulations show that absorption features are stronger for the low mass accretion state, where NH is high.   Figure 3: CLOUDY simulation of all epochs depicting the emission and absorption features. For the simulation, we used an ionization parameter of 100 (red) and 1000 (blue) erg cm s-1, motivated by the observational results.  Our key findings are as follows: The accretion rates and the geometry of the dynamic corona changed significantly during the observation period.  The maximum outflow rate estimated is ~12% of the inflow rate and confirmed the previous findings that the outflows are present in the system.  The accretion-ejection model-fitted mass is placed within a range between 4. 38 ± 0. 34−4. 51 ± 0. 29 × 106 Msun and, remarkably, matches the optical observation.  The outflow velocity is less than the escape velocity infers that the outflowing material could not go farther away from the gravitational potential of the black hole, which is called ‘failed wind’, that blocked the central radiation and caused the changing look phenomena. In the future, the study of a sample of Changing Look AGN using high-resolution spectroscopy can provide a clearer picture of how this phenomenon is achieved. Acknowledgement:I thank Ms. M.

    "title": "Solar cycle 25 is going to be a bit stronger than cycle 24!",
    "body": "2023/04/12 -  Forecasting the strength of the solar cycle is of the utmost importance because it affects space weather and our technology-based society. By a riveting feature of the solar cycles, i. e. Waldmeier effect (WE2), we find a linear relationship between the solar cycle rise rate and cycle amplitude. Also, the previous cycle’s poloidal field (PF) rise rate is physically related to the next cycle’s rise rate and amplitude. Using this physical connection, we predicted the strength of Solar Cycle 25 to be 137+/-23, which extends the temporal range of the solar cycle prediction to much earlier than what previous studies were able to do. Also, this prediction is very close to what we got by direct application of the Waldmeier effect (WE2). Currently, solar cycle 25 is in progress, which is following our forecast quite well.  IntroductionThe Sun is our nearest star, which generates an incredible amount of energy in different forms like light and heat, charged particles, magnetic fields, gamma, and X- rays. The Sun’s dynamic magnetic field is responsible for energetic events like solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The sunspots (Fig. 1), regions of strong magnetic fields on the solar surface, are also the result of the Sun’s dynamic magnetic field. The number of sunspots varies periodically in about a 11-year cycle. This cycle is popularly known as the solar cycle or the sunspot cycle. The strength of the solar magnetic field is strongly coupled with the activity level of the solar cycle. These events concertedly create weather in space (“space weather”), which affects the interplanetary medium and planetary atmosphere. Sometimes this space weather has hazardous impacts on our technology-dependent society. In a strong solar cycle, many more such energetic events are observed and thus have huge effects on the space weather. Space weather interferes with the Earth’s atmosphere and disrupts radio communications, power grids, and satellites. Thus, space weather is currently a vital issue and a novel field of exploration. The scientific community is actively trying to understand space weather phenomena and its impact on us. Therefore, the prediction of the dynamic solar cycle strength is of the utmost importance. Most of us have seen the bulb turning on in the headlight of the bicycle at night. This bulb used to give more light when the paddles of the bicycle went fast and when the paddles stopped the bulb was extinguished, right? There was a small dynamo in the bicycle which used to produce current when the bicycle was moving. Inside the dynamo, a permanent magnet is rotated in the middle of some coils of wire. The rotating magnet produces a changing magnetic field and thus magnetic flux. By Faraday’s law, it gives an e. m. f. and generates current in the coils of wire. The top of the dynamo is touched against the rim of the bicycle which rotates when the bicycle is moving. Similarly, the solar dynamo is the action of different flows inside the sun and produces currents, and these currents give the dynamic magnetic field. The Sun has two types of magnetic fields, one is a toroidal field, and the other is a poloidal field (see Fig. 2). In 1955, Parker suggested that the sunspot cycle is produced by an oscillation between the poloidal and the toroidal magnetic fields, resulting in a 11-year periodic magnetic cycle. In this theory, the poloidal field gives a toroidal field and vice versa by the dynamo process. Interestingly, this magnetic cycle follows a specific property i. e. the Waldmeier effect (WE). In 1935, Waldmeier showed that the rise time of the solar cycles is inversely proportional to the cycle’s amplitudes. This effect is known as the Waldmeier effect (WE1). Also, a strong correlation was found between the rise rate and the amplitude of the cycle, and this is known as the Waldmeier effect (WE2). Further, the feature of the Waldmeier effect (WE2) enables us to establish a linear relationship between the rise rate of the cycle and the amplitude of the cycle. Motivated by this relationship, we analyzed the observational data of Sunspot number (SSN) and sunspot area (SSA) for the solar cycles.   Figure 1. Sunspots ( black dots ) on the surface of the sun. (Image credit: NASA/SDO) Using the data from the past 13 solar cycles, we found a strong linear correlation between the rise rate and the strength of the solar cycles. Thus, we can predict the solar Cycle 25’s amplitude by applying the linear fit between these two parameters. Using this method, we predicted the solar Cycle 25’s peak amplitude to be 138 +/- 26, even though it started just two years ago. We also expect this cycle to attain its peak around mid-2024. For checking the robustness and reliability of this method, we also predicted the amplitudes of a few past cycles, which agree quite well with the corresponding observations, as shown in Fig. 3.   Figure 2. Sketches of the poloidal and toroidal field of the sun  Figure 3. The plot shows the comparison of predicted amplitudes (using WE2) with observed solar cycle amplitudes. The blue curve shows the temporal variation of the observed sunspot number (SSN). Squares show the predicted amplitudes based on the WE2, and vertical lines their errors. The vertical dotted line and the horizontal arrow show the time of the predicted peak of Cycle 25 and the error in that time’s prediction respectively. Prediction of Cycle 25's amplitude using the rise rate of the previous cycle's poloidal field is shown by a dark red-filled circle.  Generally, the scientific community uses a highly robust physics-based method to predict the upcoming solar cycle strength at solar cycle minimum, called the polar precursor method. In this method, the amplitude of the poloidal field at the solar cycle minimum is taken as the seed to predict the amplitude of the next solar cycle. Motivated by this, we analyzed the poloidal field at cycle minima and the rise rate of the next cycle, and obtained a high linear correlation between them for both observational and model data. This strong correlation indicates that a strong poloidal field at cycle minima certainly makes the following cycle rise faster and it also becomes stronger complying with the Waldmeier effect (WE2). Now, since we found that the polar field at cycle minima is strongly correlated with the rise rate of the cycle, therefore going one step backward in their evolution, we find a fascinating feature. This feature reveals that the rise rate of the poloidal field after polarity reversal (north pole to south pole or vice versa) is strongly correlated to the rise rate and amplitude of the next cycle (see Fig. 4). Moreover, we also found a strong correlation between the poloidal field build-up rate and the peak poloidal field. These features can be explained with the help of the solar dynamo process. Thus, these results suggest a physical link between the poloidal field build-up rate and the rise rate of the next cycle. Therefore, WE2 enables us to predict the amplitude of the next cycle from the rise rate of the poloidal field calculated from the data a few years after the polarity reversal of the previous cycle. By applying a linear fit between the poloidal field rise rate and amplitude of the next cycle for the data of previous cycles, we predicted the peak of cycle 25 will be around 137 +/- 23 This value is very close to the value we got directly from WE2. Our work shows a strong physical connection between the polar field build-up rate and the amplitude of the next solar cycle. Further, it also shows the crucial physical link between the polar field rise rate and the Waldmeier effect (WE2), since our prediction of the peak amplitude of the current solar cycle based on WE2 (138 +/- 26) is very close to that based on the polar field rise rate (137 +/- 23). Thus, using our novel method allows us to make a reliable prediction of the amplitude of a solar cycle as early as about 9 years before it actually reaches its peak !  Figure 4. Scatter plots between the rise rate of the polar field with the rise rate of the next cycle and cycle amplitude.

Recently, solar Cycle 25 activity was in the news, and it has been observed that its activity has quickly ramped up. Even though the sun has not yet reached its peak activity level, it has already exceeded many predictions. Until now, the sun is following the same pattern we predicted based on the polar field rise rate. Thus, our technique will further increase the temporal range of prediction of the solar cycle strength and will also help to understand the dynamo process more physically.

    "title": "Nuclear Pasta in the crust of neutron star",
    "body": "2023/04/12 -  The article discusses the structure of the neutron star crust. In the neutron star’s crust, exotic structures commonly known as “nuclear pasta” are believed to exist. The pasta structure impacts various structural, thermal and transport properties of the crust and therefore needs to be investigated. Using a simple nuclear model, the present article estimates the content of pasta structures in the crust and its implication on the neutron star properties.   Pictorial representation of the Crab Pulsar (PSR B0531+21) in the centre of the Crab Nebula (a remnant of the supernova SN 1054), which was discovered in 1968. Pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars with very strong magnetic fields which funnel jets of particles out along the two magnetic poles. The image combines optical data from Hubble (in red) and X-ray images from Chandra (in blue). Adopted from NASA. IntroductionIn 1934, a few years after the discovery of the neutron, astronomers Baade and Zwicky, in their pioneering work, coined the term “supernova” and hypothesised the existence of neutron stars. It took another 30 years for astronomers to discover the first neutron star in 1968. The discovery of the neutron star unfolded a new era of science with nuclear astrophysics as its main focus. A neutron star is formed from the collapsed core of a massive star that has undergone a supernova explosion. The massive stars, during their lifetime, ignite their core elements up to the Iron (Fe), after which fusion stops as it is the most stable element in the periodic table. This results in the gravitational collapse of the star due to the unavailability of the fuel to counter gravity, giving rise to the supernova explosion. During the supernova, the outer layers of the star are blown away while the core collapses in on itself, causing the protons and electrons in the core to combine and form neutrons. This creates a dense, compact object consisting almost entirely of neutrons compressed into a radius of only about 10 km.  The density of a typical neutron star material is 1014 times that of water. In recent years, the origin, structure and dynamics of neutron stars have played a central role in multi-messenger and gravitational-wave astronomy. It has provided us with the opportunity to understand the behaviour of fundamental forces, especially strong and weak nuclear forces, in extreme environmental situations. In the last few decades, enormous efforts have been applied to understand the structure of the neutron star, which is limited by our understating of nuclear many-body force. However, with the available variety of data from various astrophysical observations, we can now better constrain the neutron star observables such as mass, radius, tidal deformity (how deformable neutron star is) etc. , and the behaviour of the equation of state (EoS) over a wide density range. Structure of Neutron Star    Figure 1: Schematic diagram of a neutron star with its interior and surface. Adopted from ( Nature Physics 9, 396–397 (2013)) The structure of a typical neutron star can be divided into three distinct parts below its thin atmosphere: 1. Outer crust:- The ground state of the outer crust of a neutron star can be described by a body-centred cubic (BCC) lattice of atomic nuclei embedded in the sea of electrons, making it globally charge neutral. With increasing star depth, more and more neutron-rich nuclei appear until the onset of the inner crust, where neutrons start dripping (i. e. nuclei are unbounded with respect to the neutron emission). The BCC structure is preferred due to its smallest lattice energy as compared to the face-centred cubic (FCC) and simple cubic (SC) lattices.   2. Inner Crust:- The inner crust is marked by the assembly of the clusters formed by neutrons and protons along with the unbound dripped neutrons making the neutron gas. The dripped neutrons stay confined in the unit cell due to the large gravitational pressure. Such a system is so extreme that it is not possible to mimic it in any laboratory on earth. The system is made neutral by the electron gas, which is distributed uniformly over the cluster and neutron gas. At high densities, i. e. , near the crust-core transition density, the system becomes “frustrated” as a result of competition between the nuclear and Coulomb interactions. The frustration leads to the system arranging itself into various exotic geometries (spheres/gnocchi, rods/spaghetti, slabs/lasagna, cylindrical voids/anti-spaghetti and spherical voids/anti-gnocchi) commonly known as “nuclear pasta. ” 3. Core:- As the density increases, the size of the cluster in the inner crust increases, and at a density called transition density, the inhomogeneities disappear, and we enter the liquid core of the star. The core is further divided into the outer and inner cores. While the outer core consists of an admixture of neutrons and protons along with the leptons ensuring charge neutrality and β–equilibrium (the chemical potential of neutron equals the chemical potential of proton and electron), the exact composition of the inner core is not yet fully understood. Various estimations in the form of Quark plasma, Kaon condensate, etc. , have been formulated for the inner core in the past. While the core of the neutron star predominantly determines the global properties of a neutron star, it is hidden behind a thin shell in the form of the crust. Therefore, to accurately determine the core structure and dynamics, it is crucial to understand the physics of the crust. It is not only relevant in the context of neutron star physics but acts as a highly sophisticated laboratory to test nuclear theories and models. Out of various structural aspects of the crust, the presence of pasta in the denser region of the inner crust has long been debated. Although there exists no direct and robust observational evidence of nuclear pasta, various tantalising observations indicate its existence. These observations include the information of magnetic field decay of neutron stars, corresponding spin evolution, quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) (astronomical object which emits large bursts of gamma-rays and X-rays at irregular intervals), quasi-periodic oscillations in giant flares etc. The amount of these pasta structures in the inner crust plays a pivotal role in the explanation of various neutron star properties. Results and DiscussionsTo investigate the possible presence of the pasta structures in the inner crust of a neutron star, we use the Compressible Liquid Drop Model(CLDM) in association with the Effective Relativistic Mean Field(E-RMF) theory. CLDM is a modified version of the conventional liquid drop model, which is one of the oldest, most groundbreaking and simplistic formalisms to explain the binding energy of an atomic nucleus. It takes the motivation from molecular physics, where the behaviour of a classical liquid drop is found to be analogous with the behaviour of an atomic nucleus. This is due to the fact that the forces binding both a liquid drop (Van-der Waals force) and a nucleus (residual strong force) are qualitatively similar. Therefore assuming the nucleus to be incompressible, the energy of a nucleus can be simply written in the form of its volume, surface and Coulomb energy. The CLDM modifies it for the case of neutron star crust and takes into account the compressibility of nuclear matter, negative lattice Coulomb energy, and the suppression of surface tension by the surrounding neutron gas. Using the Wigner-Seitz(WS) approximation, the energy of the system in the inner crust of a neutron star can simply be written as  In the above equation, the surface, curvature and the coulomb energy correspond to the finite size correction to the bulk energy, i. e. the volume energy in case of liquid drop model. The bulk energy of nuclear matter and energy of the neutron gas is extracted from E-RMF formalism which is a state-of-the-art framework based on quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is the fundamental theory of strong nuclear interaction. The QCD itself cannot be applied to explain the nuclear matter at low-density, which is one of its unresolved limitations. The parameter sets of E-RMF theory are designed to satisfy various ground state properties of atomic nuclei, such as binding energy, charge, radius, as well as constraints derived from astrophysical and laboratory observations of mass and radius of neutron stars, and flow data from Heavy-Ion Collisions(HIC). In our calculations, we use thirteen E-RMF sets, which satisfy the recent observational constraints on the maximum mass and radius of the neutron star. These sets differ in the bulk nuclear matter properties such as symmetry energy (characterises the variation of the binding energy as the neutron to proton ratio of a nuclear system is varied), incompressibility, the binding energy of infinite nuclear matter etc. These properties characterise a particular parameter set, and a large amount of research is undergoing to put stringent constraints on them. However, there are still uncertainties on their exact values, and therefore, the nuclear matter properties become model dependent. In this study, utilising various parameter sets gives us the flexibility to investigate these model dependencies on the existence of pasta structure in the inner crust of the neutron star. Using the experience from molecular dynamics simulation, we consider five shapes of pasta structures, namely: spheres, rods, slabs, tubes and bubbles. At a given baryon density, energy minimization leads to the identification of the most favourable pasta structure. We see that the spheres occupy the shallower region of the inner crust and are subsequently accompanied by rods, slabs, tubes and bubbles. The number of unique pasta structures occurring in the inner crust of the neutron star depends essentially on the equation of state or the nuclear model considered. Out of various bulk matter properties, the symmetry energy governs the pasta content in the crust. An equation of state with larger symmetry energy in the subsaturation density regions (⍴&lt; 0. 1 fm-3) estimate a thicker crust with more unique pasta layers. The transition (transition from heterogeneous crust to the homogenous core) pressure and density also depend on the symmetry energy. These parameters are crucial inputs to calculate the crust profile of the neutron star. Accurate knowledge of these parameters, in association with the determination of symmetry energy from various Heavy Ion Collision experiments, can give us the opportunity to understand nuclear interaction in more detail. The typical thickness of the inner crust of a neutron star is approximately 1 km. We see that pasta layers constitute almost 50% of the crust mass and account for 20% of its thickness. These results are important as the pasta structure impacts various phenomena in the neutron star crust, such as its cooling, rotation, Quasiperiodic Oscillations (QPOs) etc. QPOs (related to the vibrations of the neutron star crust) provide us with much-needed information on the neutron star crust structure.  In our calculations, we found that the pasta structure significantly impacts the fundamental frequency mode of these oscillations. In addition, they also alter the shear response of the crust. The pasta structure does not affect the global properties of the neutron star, yet it profoundly impacts the microphysics of the crust. The results of the present work need to be confirmed by future measurements of neutron star observables. Moreover, modern theoretical Bayesian analysis methods also serve as an aid in determining these results, and our results are in agreement with them.

    "title": "Imploding Cometary Clouds: An Astronomer's Perspective",
    "body": "2023/04/12 -  The interstellar molecular clouds are the high-density regions between the stars having elements in the molecular phase. These clouds usually come up with different structures based on the influence of nearby massive ionizing stars. Also, these stars can either hinder or trigger the star formation in the molecular clouds. The ambient magnetic field towards these clouds also found to regulate the star formation and structural evolution. In our work we study the magnetic field structure (projected on the plane -of-sky) of a molecular cloud shaped as a comet in the Orion region of the sky. We found the evidence that the magnetic field is dragged away by the pressure of the nearby massive ionizing source and shaping the curvy structure of the cloud.  IntroductionThe region in between the stars is called the interstellar medium which is mainly composed of clouds of gas and dust. In interstellar clouds, starlight cannot pass through the highly dense area, which is why hydrogen can preserve its molecular state (H2). Also, other chemical elements, for example, carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH3), water (H2O), etc. exist in the form of molecules. Therefore, high-density interstellar clouds are called molecular clouds. Typically, the molecular clouds have an average density of 100-300 molecules cm-3. These molecular clouds are considered to be the potential sites of birth of young stellar objects (YSOs), through collapse under the influence of gravitational force, which tends to drive the cloud material inward towards the center of gravity. Massive OB stars (Mass &gt;= 8Msun, with spectral types O and B) are considered to affect their surrounding molecular clouds significantly. The energetic photons emitted from these massive stars promptly ionize the immediate vicinities, resulting in a shock which eventually results in non-uniform cloud structures, such as Bright-Rimmed Clouds (BRCs), Cometary Globules (CGs), the Elephant’s Trunk Nebula, etc (examples are shown in Figure 1) based on their appearances. BRCs consist of a compact, dusty edge similar to a narrow, bright-rimmed head along with a faint elongated tail-like structure extending from the head, which is towards the side of the nearby massive OB stars. Many of the BRCs display more collimated structure, looking like a comet, which are named as CGs. Also, we can see elongated structures resembling an elephant’s head and trunk, which are designated as Elephant’s Trunk Nebula. Despite their structures, these clouds are invariably aligned with their long axes almost parallel to the direction of the ionizing sources, for example, nearby OB stars.                Figure 1: (Left) Bright-rimmed cloud named SFO 18, Credit: Jim Thommes, (Middle) Cometary globule named CG 12, Credit: Sebastian Volmer, (Right) Elephant’s Trunck nebula named IC 1396A, Credit: Spitzer space telescope.  The shocks taking place in these cloud structures can trigger the star formation, by possibly compressing the inner dense cores and eventually tend to gravitational collapse. The evolution of these elongated molecular clouds and the star formation in them are found to be regulated by the orientation and strength of the ambient magnetic fields. An initially perpendicular magnetic field of weak and medium strengths is dragged and made to orient following the cloud structure during the dynamical evolution of the globule by the photoionizing radiation from the nearby ionizing source (see Figure 2). However, a strong perpendicular field remains in its initial alignment. Therefore, an investigation of the magnetic field geometry surrounding the molecular clouds is important to study the structures and the dynamics of the globules. Polarimetry (a tool to measure the polarization of the electromagnetic wave, e. g. , starlight) is a great tool that is widely used to investigate the magnetic field structure projected on the plane-of-sky (BPOS) around the molecular clouds.     Figure 2: Illustration of a photoevaporating magnetized molecular cloud. The purple lines are the magnetic field lines (with an orientation of ∼80◦ to the direction of ionizing photons). The molecular cloud is shown in green. The ionized gas is also presented in red. Credit: Henney et al. (2009).  The source studied in this workWe focused on a CG named L1616, that resides at an angular distance of about 8◦ west of the Orion OB1 associations, which is a group of massive OB stars at the Orion constellation. It shows evidence of ongoing star formation activity. An older population towards the north–eastern edge of the cloud (directed towards the Ori OB1 association) and a younger population towards the head region has been noticed, which means a trend of small-scale sequential star formation is present towards L1616. In Figure 3, we show the locations of L1616 and the nearby massive OB stars.     Figure 3: Positions of the bright Orion stars near L1616 plotted over the Planck 10◦ × 12◦ 857 GHz image. Area of our study of L1616 is indicated by a red colored box of size 1. 5◦ × 1. 5◦. The x and y axes show the right ascension (RA) and declination (Dec) of this region, respectively, which are used to mark the position of any object in the equitorial coordinate system. Details can be found here. Image credit: Saha et al. (2022).

The reference vector with 2% polarization is also shown. The x and y axes show the right ascension (RA) and declination (Dec) of this region, respectively. Image credit: Saha et al. (2022).  Results and DiscussionIn order to study the BPOS towards L1616, we carried out optical polarimetric observations of this cloud using ARIES IMaging POLarimeter (AIMPOL) attached with 104 cm Sampurnanand Telescope, located at Aryabhatta Research Institute of observational sciencES (ARIES), India (see this link for details). In Figure 4, we show our optical polarimetric results. The orientation of the yellow polarization vectors indicates the angle of BPOS from the celestial north (the point about which all the stars in the northern hemisphere are seen to revolve). A curvature in the BPOS can be noticed in the head region of L1616. Also, the polarization vectors are found to show the trend of being twisted along the curvy tail. Overall, the BPOS is found to be more chaotic in the head region, which might be a result of the disintegration of cloud material by the energy input from the associated young stars. The presence of the massive OB stars can also impact the BPOS. From our results we conclude that possibly the ambient BPOS had an initial alignment perpendicular to the major axis of L1616. This alignment might be dragged away from the source of ionization following the structure of the globule, resulting in the twist of BPOS in the head area of the globule. We have also made an attempt to investigate the pressure and the extent of the impact of the massive stars on L1616. The pressure exerted by epsilon Ori (the most massive star among the others in the Orion OB1 association) is estimated to be the highest, therefore epsilon Ori seems to be the main source to influence L1616. Also, the proper motion (motion of the objects projected on the sky plane) of the associated YSOs with respect to epsilon Ori shows evidence that most of them are moving away from the direction of epsilon Ori (main ionizing source). Based on the assumption that the motion of the YSOs follow the motion of the parental cloud, we can say that the cloud L1616 is currently being pushed away by the impact of epsilon Ori.

    "title": "Can missing physics in gravitational waveforms mimic false violations of general relativity?",
    "body": "2023/03/16 -  General theory of relativity proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915 has passed all the experimental and observational tests with flying colors. Gravitational waves from the merger of compact binaries such as black holes and neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to test general relativity in the strong-field regime of gravity. Missing physics in the modeling of gravitational waves can appear as a false violation of general relativity.    Figure 1: The SXS simulation of colliding black holes distorting spacetime around them.  Image Credit: The SXS project. General theory of relativity predicts that if two black holes are orbiting around each other, the orbit of the binary will shrink due to the emission of gravitational waves. As black holes come closer and closer, their orbital speed increases. The black holes move close to the speed of light in their final orbits, dragging spacetime around them. Finally, two black holes collide and merge, releasing an enormous amount of energy in the form of gravitational waves and leaving behind a more massive spinning black hole. The emitted gravitational waves from these mergers carry information about the nature of gravity in these extreme regions of spacetime. In 1974, Hulse and Taylor discovered a pulsar orbiting around a neutron star. According to general relativity, the binary system must be losing energy due to the emission of gravitational waves. By observing the orbital period of the binary, they found that the orbit of the binary was shrinking and the rate of shrinking was in excellent agreement with the predictions of general relativity. This observation proved the existence of gravitational waves and tested general relativity in strong gravitational fields where the theory had never been tested before. This discovery of gravitational waves earned the Nobel Prize in physics in 1993. On September 14, 2015, gravitational waves from the merger of two black holes were detected by Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), nearly 100 years after Einstein’s discovery of general relativity. This first direct observation of gravitational waves opened a new window to the unexplored dark universe. The observation won the Nobel Prize in 2017. Till now, nearly 90 gravitational wave signals from merging black holes have been detected. Each new gravitational wave observation helps physicists test general relativity. No evidence of physics beyond general relativity has been found in any of these observations. However, it is possible that beyond general relativity effects are minuscule and not visible in current-generation gravitational wave detectors. General relativity is currently our best understanding of gravity. However, there are unsolved problems in cosmology such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy, that cannot be explained by general relativity alone. Many modified theories of gravity have been proposed as an alternative to general relativity to address these unsolved problems. The ideal way to test the true theory of gravity would be to match the observed gravitational wave signals against the predictions of various theories of gravity and see which theory is best supported by the data. However, waveform modeling in modified theories of gravity is still in the infant stage. Hence we use our best understanding of general relativity and look for deviations away from general relativity. Among the numerous tests of general relativity, parametrized tests are one of the unique ways to test general relativity. In parametrized tests, the gravitational wave signal in general relativity is modified by adding extra phenomenological deviation parameters that attempt to capture a particular class of deviation from general relativity. The value of these deviation parameters is zero in general relativity. Precise measurement of deviation parameters reveals the nature of the gravitational wave signal. If the gravitational wave signal is consistent with general relativity, the values of these deviations should be consistent with zero. The accuracy of these tests relies on the accuracy of gravitational waveforms which describe the dynamics of binary. The task of developing waveform models is a complex one that involves making approximations, assumptions, and the possibility of modeling errors due to missing physics. This means that our waveform models are not able to perfectly capture the behavior of gravitational waves. The inherent imperfections in waveform models can introduce systematic bias into estimated parameters such as black hole’s masses, spins, and deviation parameters. These systematic biases on deviation parameters if become greater than the statistical uncertainty, may appear as a false violation of general relativity. The interpretation of the measured signal may show a contradiction from general relativity leading us to believe that there is something wrong with the theory, but we have to be very careful before making such extraordinary claims. In a recent study, conducted in collaboration with Prof. Marc Favata (Montclair state university, USA) and Prof. K.  G. Arun (Chennai Mathematical Institute, India), we focused on the systematic bias due to neglect of orbital eccentricity in the waveform model and demonstrated how eccentricity-induced systematic bias can mimic a false violation of general relativity. As two black holes in an elliptic orbit revolve around each other, due to the emission of gravitational waves, the orbit of the binary tends to become circular. Gravitational wave detectors are presently capable of detecting the gravitational waves from the last few orbits of the binary before its merger. Therefore, it is expected that the binary’s orbit has likely already been circularized by the time it is detected. LIGO and Virgo currently use quasi-circular waveforms for testing general relativity. The ellipticity of a binary’s orbit depends on its formation history. Black hole binaries formed in the galactic fields are expected to be in quasi-circular orbits due to various mass transfer episodes between the binary’s constituent. However, for black holes that are formed inside dense star clusters, it is possible to remain in highly eccentric orbits due to dynamical interactions and exchanges with other stellar objects in the cluster. The orbit of these binaries may not be fully circularized due to the emission of gravitational waves, but still possess small amount of eccentricity when the detector observes the binary. For eccentric binaries, the neglect of eccentricity in waveform models may cause the deviation parameters to be biased and exhibit inconsistency with general relativity.     (a) LIGO    (b) Cosmic Explorer   Figure 2: Systematic and statistical errors on the leading order deviation parameter as a function of orbital eccentricity e0. Systematic errors are represented by solid lines and statistical errors are denoted by dashed lines. These errors are shown for four representative binaries with different total masses. The orbital eccentricity e0 on the x-axis is defined at a gravitational wave frequency of 10 Hz. If a black hole binary with total mass 15M⊙ (solar mass) and orbital eccentricity 0. 04 is observed by LIGO, the eccentricity-induced systematic bias on the leading-order deviation parameter becomes comparable to the statistical errors as illustrated in the adjacent figure (taken from Saini et al. (2022)). These biases will shift the deformation parameters away from their true value, which is zero in general relativity, indicating a false deviation from general relativity. This value of eccentricity is even lower (0. 005) for the more sensitive future third-generation gravitational wave detector (Cosmic Explorer). It is very likely that in the near future, we detect gravitational waves from the mergers of black holes in eccentric orbits. There are already signatures of a few eccentric mergers in the detected gravitational wave signals. To avoid the risk of falsely claiming a breakdown of general relativity, controlling waveform systematics is of immediate need for the gravitational wave community. References: [Saini et al.

    "title": "Using a pseudo-Kerr formalism to study accretion and wind flows around rotating black holes",
    "body": "2023/03/14 -  Hydrodynamic flows around black holes is a fascinating area of research that provides a window into the processes that power relativistic jets and energetic particle acceleration. However, this is a challenging task when studied using the full general relativistic framework. In our work, we find an exact pseudo-potential formalism that can be used to study hydrodynamics around rotating black holes very accurately. This formalism can be a useful tool in numerical simulation studies and to extract spin parameter of black hole candidates.  Accretion is one of the most fundamental physical processes in the universe that describes the inflow of matter towards a central gravitating object or the centre of mass of an extended system and is responsible for the formation and evolution of structures in the universe. However, the most spectacular observational manifestation of accretion occurs when the central objects are the most compact in the cosmos – black holes! The existence of black holes (BHs) is a remarkable prediction of Einstein’s theory of General Relativity (GR). According to GR, gravity is a geometric phenomenon that arises from the curvature of space-time instead of being an invisible force that attracts objects towards each other. The more massive an object, the more it curves space-time. BHs are regions in space bounded by a surface called the event horizon from which nothing, not even light, can escape. In this sense, they are perfect space-time traps, and the event horizon marks the boundary of no return. This means that a BH itself is invisible. However, astronomers can still observe them indirectly through the way it affects the motion of nearby stars and pulls matter into orbit around them. As matter accretes around a BH, it heats up. It releases vast amounts of energy in the form of radiation. In this way, the accretion of matter onto BHs powers some of the most luminous sources in the universe. According to GR, a BH is characterized by just three observable properties – mass M, angular momentum J and electric charge Q. In any realistic setting, however, a BH is unlikely to have any electric charge because it will typically be rapidly neutralized by the plasma surrounding it. Therefore, astrophysically relevant BHs can be fully described by only their mass and angular momentum. It is helpful to define the dimensionless spin parameter of a BH as a=J/M, i. e. , the angular momentum per unit mass of the BH, that can take any values within the range 0&lt;|a|&lt;1. The BH is non-rotating when a=0 and a=1 correspond to the maximum value of the angular momentum a BH can attain. To determine the mass of a BH, astronomers can observe how groups of stars and gas move around the BH, which is a relatively easy task. However, the spin is rather subtle because it requires probing the strong gravity region close to the BH, where relativistic effects are prominent. So, the measurement of BH spin requires a model that can accurately describe the relativistic effects close to the event horizon of the BH. In general, most of the astrophysical BHs are expected to be rotating. They are defined by the Kerr metric, which is an exact solution of the Einstein field equations of GR. The geometry of the space-time described by the Kerr metric is shown in Figure 1, where all the important surfaces are marked. The outer event horizon is essentially the surface from which nothing can return. The shaded region called the ergoregion is another essential region where everything is forced to rotate with the BH and has exciting observational consequences.   Figure 1: The geometry of the space-time described by the Kerr metric (Credit: Matt Visser) To study accretion flows around a BH, one must solve the relativistic hydrodynamics equations. Since this task is very challenging when studied using GR, it is often useful to use the pseudo-potential approach. The advantage of the pseudo-potential approach is that one can use the equations of Newtonian hydrodynamics but with the Newtonian potential replaced by a pseudo-potential that mimics the relativistic effects around BHs. One can use this approach to easily study complex processes around BHs as if the central object is a Newtonian object. This approach is also helpful in easily handling radiative transfer problems in time-dependent numerical simulations just by replacing a few lines in numerical codes written for a Newtonian object. However, the pseudo-potential must be accurate enough so that the errors crept in for not using GR equations are within the observational errors. For non-rotating BHs, a pseudo-potential was introduced by Paczynski &amp; Wiita (1980, hereafter PW80) that captures the relativistic features of the non-rotating BHs quite accurately and has been extensively used to investigate the physical properties of accretion flows around non-rotating BHs. Our recent publication derives the exact form of the effective potential for hydrodynamic flows around a rotating BH from the Kerr metric. We assume that the accretion flow is confined near the equatorial plane of the BH, and we find that this potential accurately reproduces the relativistic features of particle orbits for the entire range of the spin parameter. One can treat this effective potential as a pseudo-potential used in a Newtonian set of equations to describe accretion flows around rotating BHs. We call this the pseudo-Kerr formalism because this uses a Newtonian approach to study hydrodynamics around rotating (Kerr) BHs which are relativistic objects. So, knowledge of Newtonian hydrodynamics is sufficient. One needn’t have to bother about GR when applying this potential to study accretion flows around BHs. This is because all the relativistic effects are already incorporated into the potential. Moreover, a Taylor series expansion of our potential reveals that the leading order term is the PW80 potential. So our potential includes all the higher-order corrections to the PW80 potential for non-rotating BHs. We use the pseudo-potential in a Newtonian approach to study accretion and wind flows around rotating BHs.   Figure 2: The variation of (a) shock location, (b) shock strength and (c) compression ratio with the specific energy of the flow for a=0. 5 and different values of angular momentum l=2. 8, 2. 9, 3. 0. The stable (and unstable) shock locations are shown by solid (and dashed) curves. The left (and right) segments of each set of curves for a particular value of angular momentum corresponds to accretion (and winds). The GR curves are shown in red color.   Figure 3: An example of shock solution in (a) accretion (a=0. 5, l=3. 0, E=1. 003) and (b) wind (a=0. 5, l=3. 0, E=1. 007) . The dashed vertical arrows indicate the stable shock transitions and the GR solutions are shown in red color.  The wind flows are outflowing matter from the region close to a BH and is an opposite process to accretion. For simplicity, we assume that the flow has no dissipation, i. e. , the fluid is chosen to be inviscid (having zero viscosity). This means that the specific angular momentum of the flow remains constant. We then solve the equations of Newtonian hydrodynamics and show that the accretion process is necessarily transonic in nature. Transonic flows in this context mean that the radial velocity of the matter is subsonic (velocity less than sound speed) far away from the BH, and it gradually increases to become supersonic (velocity greater than sound speed) and finally enters the event horizon of the BH with the speed of light. Transonic flows are essential because they provide evidence for the formation of shock waves which are abrupt and strong discontinuities in the properties (pressure, temperature and density) of the accreting matter usually associated with violent phenomena in BH environments. Shock waves play a critical role in the dynamics of accretion flows. They can have important effects on the structure and evolution of accretion flows. In studies of transonic flows, it is useful to define a quantity called Mach number M=v/as, which is the ratio of the velocity of matter v and the speed of sound as. Then, M&lt;1 for subsonic flow and M&gt;1 for supersonic flow. Two crucial parameters useful in studying shock waves are the shock strength S=M-/M+ and the shock compression ratio R=ρ+/ρ-, where M is the Mach number, and ρ is the flow density. Both the quantities are calculated at the location of the shock, and the +/- signs correspond to quantities just after/before the shock. These quantities measure the discontinuities in the Mach number (or velocity) and density of the accreting matter. We investigate the shock solutions in accretion and winds in detail. Comparing our results with the GR solutions reveals that our approach reproduces the GR values accurately. In Figure 2, we show the variation of the shock location, shock strength and shock compression ratio as a function of the specific energy for different values of the angular momentum of the flow for both accretion and wind. One can observe that the values are very close to the GR values (the red curves). In Figure 3, we show an example of a shock solution (the variation of the Mach number with the radial coordinate) for both accretion and wind and compare it with the GR solution (the red curves). The shock location in both cases is shown with dashed vertical arrows. We find that our approach reproduces the GR results with high accuracy, and the errors, if any, are all within observational limits. This is true even when one chooses a highly spinning BH with a~1. This formalism can be a useful tool to study various aspects of accretion processes around BHs and to carry out numerical simulations that could provide new insights into problems that are usually tedious when studied using the GR approach.

    "body": "2023/02/15 -  We study how galaxies and other sources in the early universe change the neutral universe or InterGalactic Medium (IGM) into the ionized one. We compare different kinds of source models and how they ionize the neutral universe which mainly consists of neutral hydrogen. We trace the largest ionized region formed by these sources by using a statistic known as the Largest Cluster Statistics (LCS). We found that LCS of different source models evolve differently and hence show different natures of ionizing photons or sources. We also investigate the geometry and topology of these ionized regions and how they are different for each model.  IntroductionThe universe on a very large scale seems like a web which we astronomers refer to as the cosmic web. Entities like galaxies and clusters of galaxies are trapped within this giant web (see figure 1). The unknown but the most abundant matter, dark matter, plays a governing role in shaping these giants by capitalizing the full potential of the most dominant force on a cosmic scale, gravitational force. We put our efforts to understand the formation and evolution of the universe including these giants by looking at the driving physics behind these.   Figure 1: Image of the cosmic web. Figure shows the dark matter distribution (taken from the Millennium simulation). Here, every bright point represents a galaxy cluster. Image Credit: V. Springel, Max-Planck-Institut für Astrophysics. The universe has undergone a significant transition on a regular basis since its birth. Figure 2 shows the evolution of our universe from the Big Bang on the left hand side to the current local universe which we see today on the right hand side of the plot. One of the major recent and remarkable phase transitions is the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), when the neutral Intergalactic Medium (IGM), mainly composed of neutral hydrogen, gets transformed into an ionized one. The galaxies residing within the dark matter halos (host of galaxies) act as one of the primary sources responsible for the reionization.   Figure 2: Pictorial representation of the evolution of our Universe according to the standard cosmological model. Image credit: astrobites In order to understand this era, we use several techniques and approaches to recreate the environment. We use analytic models (refer to  Wyithe and Loeb 2012), semi-analytic models (refer to  Mutch et al 2016), semi-numerical models (refer to  Majumdar et al. 2016 ), etc. , to understand the EoR and to comply with what we observe from large surveys conducted using advanced telescopes that are increasingly more sensitive. It is evident that different sources during EoR emit different kinds of ionizing photons, and hence, ionize the IGM in a different way. In our analysis, we investigate this era by focusing on the properties of some of these possible sources which can ionize the IGM. We consider six reionization source models based on the semi-numerical method originally proposed in  Majumdar et al. 2016. These source models differ from each other in two main aspects: a) how the number of ionizing photons emitted by the sources are related to their host halo mass i. e. Nphotons ∝ (Mhalo)n and b) how the rest frame energy of the ionizing photons is distributed. The different source models considered in our work are mentioned in the table below. The Uniform Ionizing Background (UIB) dominated source model emits hard X-ray photons having large mean free path and hence creates a uniform ionizing background. The Soft X-Ray (SXR) dominated source model emits soft X-ray photons having limited mean free path. Source models like Fiducial (assumes 100% contribution of UV rays coming out from the galaxies residing inside the dark-matter halos) and Power Law (PL) (n=3) differ from each other in terms of the number of ionizing photons they emit following the relation shown in point (a) above.

On the other hand, UV + SXR + UIB source model shows a combined contribution of UV photons, hard X-ray photons and soft X-ray photons. We investigate how the ionized regions formed by these sources evolve with redshift and what geometrical or topological information we can grab from their evolution by looking at their shape and size. One can use Minkowski functionals (a set of four functionals which gives information about the geometrical and topological distribution of matter in the universe) (for example, Bag et al. 2018, Mecke et al. 1994) to define the morphology of an object. In our work, we specifically use this to define the shape and size of our object (ionized region in our case). We use an algorithm called SURFGEN2 which identifies ionized regions from the density field and informs about their shape and size in the form of three Shapefinders (namely, thickness, breadth and length). If we look at these ionized regions, with time, different reionization source models forming these ionized regions grow in size as well as in numbers, which then start to overlap. At some point in time, they coalesce together and form a single large connected ionized region as one can notice from the middle and right panels in the figure 3. This transition phase is known as the percolation transition (one can look at the articles Klypin and Shandarin 1993, Capp Yess and Shandarin 1996).  In our analysis, out of many ionized regions, we primarily focus on the largest ionized region and its evolution around the percolation. We use the Largest Cluster Statistics (LCS) which is defined as the ratio of the volume of the largest ionized region to that volume of all ionized regions in a simulation volume to trace the largest ionized region. LCS = Volume of Largest Ionized Region / Volume of all ionized region Before percolation we have a very small largest ionized region but as we reach percolation and after percolation, the ionized region increases drastically, and at the end of reionization, almost the entire simulation box is filled with the largest ionized region as evident from the figure 3 as we go from left to right.   Figure 3: Figure shows the transition of the largest ionized region from smaller size before percolation to the size of the entire simulation box after percolation. Middle panel shows the onset of percolation.  As the reionization progresses, the neutral hydrogen present in the IGM ionizes and eventually the entire IGM converts into an ionized one at the end of the reionization. The neutral fraction (xHI) informs about the amount of neutral hydrogen present in a volume with respect to the entire hydrogen species including both neutral and ionized one at any time. In our analysis, we use this quantity to see the evolution of LCS and shapefinders which we discussed. ResultsEvolution of Largest Cluster Statistics: The largest ionized region evolves differently for different reionization source models. The point of percolation is also different for different models. The inside-out scenarios where the reionization starts from the denser part of the IGM and then proceeds to the less dense part, the percolation occurs at much higher neutral fraction as compared to its counterpart, the outside-in scenario, where reionization starts from less dense regions and then the high-dense region is covered. Figure 4 shows the variation of Largest Cluster Statistics (LCS) with the neutral fraction and Filling Factor (FF) for different reionization models. Here, Filling Factor is defined as the ratio of volume of all ionized regions to volume of our simulation box. One can notice from the left panel that the largest ionized region or LCS before percolation (shown by vertical lines) is significantly small for all reionization models but at the onset of percolation and after percolation, an abrupt increment in LCS can be observed. This result is quite obvious because as the reionization progresses, different ionized regions grow and interconnect with each other and hence form a single interconnected ionized region which is true for all reionization models as one can notice from the figure. Hence, before percolation, when we have a very small largest ionized region, it is indistinguishable from other ionized regions but as we reach percolation, they interconnect and become quite distinguishable. It depicts how the neutral IGM slowly transformed into an ionized one when the ionized bubbles got enough time to develop. However, percolation for different models occurs at different neutral fractions. The inside-out reionization models percolate at higher neutral fraction (shown by solid lines) whereas the outside-in reionization models percolate at lower neutral fraction. At the end of reionization, we can observe a single large ionized region occupying the entire simulation volume as is evident from the right panel of figure 4, where LCS is close to unity.   Figure 4: The percolation transition has been compared for all six reionization models in terms of LCS. The left panel shows the LCS as a function of neutral fraction (xHI) whereas the right panel illustrates how LCS evolves with FF for the different reionization scenarios. In both panels, the vertical lines represent the percolation transitions in the reionization models with corresponding colors.  Hence, we can say that following the LCS along with the percolation, we can distinguish between the two broad categories of reionization models i. e, inside-out and outside-in reionization models. Shape of Largest Ionized Region: The ionized bubbles formed by different sources, in principle, can be of complicated shape or geometry as they grow. For ease of understanding, one can use a simple geometrical or topological approach for the same. The Shapefinder technique uses Minkowski functionals to unveil the shape and size of the ionized region. The four Minkowski functions for a closed 2-D surface are:  Volume enclosed, V: Informs about the enclosed volume within the surface of an object or ionized region.  Surface area, S: Informs about the surface area of the object.  Integrated Mean Curvature (C): Informs about the concavity or convexity of the surface or in other words principal curvature (or radius of curvature) of the surface.  Gaussian Mean Curvature (Euler Characteristics): Informs about the topological properties of an object. The Shapefinders are expressed as the ratio of these Minkowski functionals to assess the shape of an object. In 3-D, the three shapefinders are :  Thickness: T = 3V/S Breadth: B = S/C Length: L = C/4πThese three are the good measures of the extension of an object in 3-dimension. We can further use these shapefinders to determine the morphology of an object by means of these two dimensionless quantities:  Planarity: P = (B-T) / (B+T) Filamentarity: F = (L-B) / (L+B)We employ these aforementioned techniques to see how the geometry or topology of the largest ionized region evolves with the redshift. An ionized region can be expressed in terms of its length, breadth and thickness, which are the three Shapefinders mentioned earlier. We show the variation of cross-section and length with the neutral fraction in figure 5. We can observe that the cross-section of the largest ionized region for all reionization scenarios in the left panel remains almost constant with the variation in neutral fraction. Whereas, in the right panel, its length increases several orders of magnitude as the reionization progresses. Hence, one can robustly confirm the fact that as the reionization progresses, the topology of the largest ionized region becomes filamentary, as one can notice in figure 6 where the filamentarity (shown by thick line curves) has a larger value than the planarity (thin line curves) for all reionization scenarios.   Figure 5: This figure illustrates the evolution of the shape of the largest ionized region (LIR) for the five reionization scenarios (excluding the clumping model since this is the only scenario where extreme reionization is considered and hence it’s shapefinders behave differently) near the respective percolation transitions. The left and right panels show the variation of cross-section (estimated by T x B) and the length (L) of the LIR on the y-axis against the neutral fractions on the x-axis.   Figure 6: Planarity and filamentarity of the largest ionized region in different models have been compared near the respective percolation transitions. The solid and dashed curves represent the reionization models following inside-out and outside-in reionizations respectively. The thick line curves (solid and dashed) represent the filamentarity and thin line curves represent the planarity of the largest ionized region in different models. We also observe that as the reionization progresses, the largest ionized regions in all the scenarios become more multi-connected as their genus (in simple words, for any surface, it represents the number of holes present in the surface and hence informs about the multi-connected regions) increases. Thus, from our findings, we can conclude that at the later stage of reionization, we observe multi-connected filamentary structures for all reionization models. We found that the reionization model, like the clumping model, which follows extreme reionization, can be distinguished or separated quite easily by the Shapefinder technique. We crudely estimate the uncertainties by dividing each original simulation volume into eight smaller sub-volumes followed by estimating the variance of various quantities from these sub-volumes. Our research group at IIT Indore is currently working on noise which we get from the observations and the impact of primary beams on LCS analysis of the 21-cm signal considering the upcoming low-frequency Square Kilometer Array (SKA1-low) observations using a realistic simulations for such observations. Conclusion   We consider the evolution of the largest ionized region by using a statistic called LCS in order to distinguish between the different reionization models.     We found that LCS for all reionization models before percolation is quite small and hence indistinguishable, but it increases abruptly at the onset of percolation. However, different reionization models percolate at different neutral fractions. Hence, following the evolution of LCS along with the percolation can help to distinguish between different models, and especially the inside-out or out-side- in models.     We also find that the cross-section of the largest ionized region in all the scenarios (except for the clumping model) remains stable at the percolation transition when the largest ionized region abruptly grows, mostly in terms of its third Shapefinder – ‘length. ’ The genus of the largest ionized region also increases as reionization progresses. Hence, multi-connected filamentary structure is observed at a later stage of EoR.

    "title": "Astrophysical autopsy of a cosmic demise",
    "body": "2023/02/15 -  As the saying goes, “न कंचित् शाश्वतम्” (lit. Nothing is permanent), and hence the nature of this universe. The ever-evolving twinkles in the starry night are also non-discriminate towards this concept. If a star is born, it ought to die. Supernovae are cosmic fireworks that do not require any occasion (e. g. , New Year or winning a football world cup!) to explode. This explosion is the terminal stage of stellar evolution. Therefore, we can say that supernova is the death of a star that sends a siren to the universe in the form of gravitational waves to radio emissions (one of the best candidates for multi-messenger astronomy).  We study one such demise in detail.      Figure 1: OpenAI’s DALL. E 2 rendering of a core-collapse supernova [Generated by author] Supernovae (SNe) have fascinated humankind since time immemorial with recorded events millennia ago. Many essential elements that are part of us also resulted from such explosions. It is imperative to understand these events in detail and try to ascertain their origins. SNe can be broadly classified as Type I and Type II on the basis of the absence and presence of hydrogen features in their spectra, which is unrelated to their explosion mechanisms (thermonuclear SN and Fe core-collapse SN). Apart from their use as independent distance indicators (Type Ia, Type II-P), they are part of various multi/interdisciplinary studies, viz. galactic chemical evolution, origins of various heavier elements, etc. The key question in supernova studies is ascertaining the progenitor, for which, at times, archival images are available through Hubble Space Telescope, but this is quite rare. There are other analytical solutions based on simplified physics related to the explosion and derived relations to estimate the explosion energy, pre-SN mass, ejecta mass, initial mass of progenitor star that exploded as SN, etc. crudely. But a more sophisticated way is to generate synthetic time evolution of flux ( light curves), and velocity evolution of ejecta, then try to match them with observations. Currently, 3D modeling is challenging and resource-hungry, and we rely on 1D hydrodynamical modeling using tools viz. Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), Stella, and other open-source frameworks. One such explosion, SN 2020jfo, happened in the galaxy M61 [Figure 2], a stellar graveyard that has also hosted 8 SNe in the past century. In contrast, our Galaxy is due for even one for centuries! We carried out the observations extensively in the optical regime from the Himalayan Chandra Telescope situated at the Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle, UT of Ladakh. More than 25 epochs of multi-band photometry and spectroscopy covered the evolution of SN 2020jfo for about a year [Figure 3]. The observations were supplemented with data from Devasthal Optical Telescope, Nainital (Uttarakhand), Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, and Swift/UVOT data. SN 2020jfo, although a Type II-P (plateau) SN, did not fit in the classical definition of a plateau which is a constant luminosity phase in light curve evolution and typically lasts for about a hundred days. A deviation from the plateau was seen after 65 days putting it under one of the rare short plateau Type II SN. The SN explosion synthesizes many radioactive elements, primarily Nickel-56, that solely power its light curve in the late phase, estimated to be 0. 033(6) solar mass. As the SN ejecta expands with time, we see the constituent inner layers of the progenitor as evident in spectral time evolution [Figure 3].    Figure 2: The location of SN 2020jfo in the host galaxy M61 is shown. Orange boxes marked are the available SDSS spectra for the host. [Credits: Teja et al. 2022] A plethora of information about ejecta, elements, and the ejecta velocity evolution could be obtained using spectra. Overall evolution is typical of Type II spectra, but we find ionized helium and rare stable nickel. Having these peculiarities, it warranted detailed studies and modeling to look for the origins of this supernova. With all the observational evidence, viz. compact progenitor, presence of stable nickel produced during stellar nucleosynthesis, and strength of nebular oxygen lines pointed towards a small mass progenitor, the present theoretical and modeling works hinted otherwise. Hence to ascertain this progenitor scenario, we employed hydrodynamical modeling of this event from the inception of the star to its death. Eventually, it defied the situation presented in some models regarding the high mass progenitors. It resulted from a lower-mass red supergiant star (RSG) going SN. Still, the mass loss mechanism with which the star lost its significant hydrogen layer is uncertain (the weighing is more towards the presence of a binary counterpart). We present the alternative scenario to the current understanding of short plateau supernova origins. We also obtained the non-detection in the radio light curve. Some of the key results obtained are as follows.       Figure 3: Panchromatic photometric (above) and optical spectroscopic (below) observations spanning about a year for SN 2020jfo are shown here. [Source: Teja et al. 2022]    Figure 4: Model light curves obtained using the MESA+STELLA framework for various evolved progenitors are plotted along with the pseudo-bolometric light curve for SN 2020jfo. The figure in the inset shows the requirement to include CSM interaction to fit the observed light curve. [Adapted from Teja et al. 2022] The SN 2020jfo peaked in the Bessell’s V photometric filter at an absolute magnitude of -17. 4(4) mag; for comparison, the Sun has an absolute magnitude of +4. 83 in the same filter, implying SN to be millions of times brighter than the Sun. From 1D hydrodynamical modeling, we found that the most plausible progenitor is an RSG with an initial mass about 12 times the mass of the Sun, a radius about 600 times the Sun’s radius, and a final pre-SN mass &lt;6 solar mass. Using the nebular-phase (post plateau decline phase, which is majorly powered by radioactive nickel decay chain) spectrum, we estimated a progenitor of mass ∼12 solar mass in corroboration with modeled mass. We concluded that It evolved in a relatively high-metallicity environment and shredded a significant amount of mass during its evolution. The presence of ionized Helium line, HV Hα feature, higher luminosity in contrast to slower velocity evolution, and the steeper decline in luminosity indicated the presence of circumstellar (CSM), which was corroborated in models [Figure 4]. A fraction of the solar mass of CSM spread across 40 AU was deduced for SN 2020jfo’s progenitor, possibly resulting from a high mass loss a few years before the collapse. With the advent of various night sky surveys, viz. ZTF , ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System), ASAS-SN (All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae), and upcoming LSST (Legacy Survey of Space and Time), there is a great boom in discovering the exotic transients, which challenge our understanding of these events. It is necessary to study these in detail using observations and modeling and, if possible, weed out any cases which are not deemed worthy as indicators of distance. With the growing sample of these events, it is possible there could be more classes to these SN than the given one, and hence these kinds of studies provide the key.

    "title": "Accounting for the presence of dust in galaxies",
    "body": "2023/02/13 -  Dust is as ubiquitous in galaxies as are stars, gases and dark matter. Although dust forms less than 1% of the mass of the interstellar medium, its importance can be gauged from the fact that dust reprocesses more than half of a galaxy’s stellar emissions. It absorbs the stellar light emissions (at UV and optical wavelengths) and re-emits in the infrared range of the spectrum. For example, our Milky Way would have been doubly bright in the optical if no dust was present in its interstellar medium. This effect of dust gets best encapsulated by the dust attenuation curve of the galaxy, which gives the optical depth of the galaxy as a function of wavelength. Analyzing data for thousands (~17000) of local galaxies (z&lt;0. 3), we find that the dust attenuation properties of a galaxy are dependent on its structure, i. e. , its internal distribution of stars and dust.  Less Formal DescriptionAccounting for the presence of dust in galaxies In this work, we have found that the behavior or the effect of dust present inside a galaxybis according to its distribution with respect to various stellar populations. We will try to explain the context and the significance of this finding in this article. We would like to begin by reminding you that dust is as crucial a component of a galaxy and as omnipresent as stars, gas, and dark matter. Dust is mainly composed of carbon and silicates, where the size of a typical dust grain ranges from 0. 01 to 1 micron. For comparison, this is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the dust we see on our furniture. The importance of dust can very well be gauged from the fact that it reprocesses more than half of the galaxy’s total stellar light. Stars, as we know, emit mainly from UV to near-IR. These photons interact with the dust particles, get scattered and absorbed, and dust then re-emits the light in the middle and far-IR region of the spectrum. For example, our Milky Way would have been doubly bright in the optical if dust was not present.     Figure 1: Due to the increased presence of birth clouds and the denser interstellar medium in spiral galaxies, both UV and optical stellar emissions encounter dust on a similar level. Thus, the slope of the attenuation curve is not steep in the UV-optical range for spiral galaxies. In contrast, in the case of elliptical galaxies, only UV emission from newly formed stars encounters dust from the circumambient birth cloud. Optical stellar emissions escape due to a decreased presence of birth clouds and the less dense interstellar medium. Thus, the slope of the attenuation curve is steep in the UV-optical range for elliptical galaxies. It is interesting to note that even though the dust has such a splendid effect on a galaxy’s stellar light, it constitutes a minuscule fraction of the galaxy’s total mass. Baryonic mass (i. e. , non-dark matter mass)  is nearly 1/6th of the galaxy’s total mass. Of this baryonic mass, 1/6th is in the interstellar medium. And of the total mass in the interstellar medium, 99% is gas, and 1% is dust. There are various mechanisms through which dust is understood to get formed, transformed, and destroyed inside a galaxy. It is mainly expected to form during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of the stars. Recent evidence also suggests that it could have formed around supernovae. But the mystery is how dust would have survived the shockwave associated with supernovae. It has also been proposed that dust might get formed around supermassive black holes. It gets destroyed either through UV rays and also gets consumed in the formation of new stars being part of the giant molecular clouds. It plays a critical role in the cooling and coagulation of such clouds. What this conveys is that the cycle of dust is intricately linked with both the star formation history as well as the future star formation rate of a galaxy. Thus accounting for the effect of dust is a primary requirement for any reasonable estimation of a galaxy’s stellar mass and star formation rate. This effect of dust is accounted for through the dust attenuation curve of a galaxy. It gives the attenuation or optical depth of a galaxy as a function of wavelength. It describes how a galaxy’s light is affected by dust at each wavelength. So a general attenuation curve peaks at far UV and becomes negligible by the time it reaches IR. These curves are used as an input in the computation of a galaxy’s stellar parameters. Their accurate knowledge is crucial for simulations, modeling, and data analysis, basically at all places where the aim is to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies. If we do not know the attenuation curve accurately, there’s no way we can distinguish between a young dusty galaxy and an old non-dusty one. In tracing the evolution of galaxies, one of the most intriguing things is that the star formation rate density of galaxies has fallen by a factor of 5 to 10 since redshift 2. This could have been both due to the decrease in star formation efficiency as well the decrease in gaseous material inside galaxies. To solve this puzzle, accurate attenuation curves have to be known for the observed galaxies over the entire redshift range. There has been a lot of progress in the estimation of these curves. Improving over the comparison methods, model methods have been successful in deriving these curves individually for each galaxy. Here the basic idea is to obtain the best match spectrum or Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) for a galaxy out of 100 thousand SEDs created with a whole range of model parameters. A major advancement has occurred with the availability of mid and especially far-IR measurements. Thanks to that, total IR luminosity works as a constraint on the dust emission and allows the attenuation parameters to be fitted freely. This has led to more detailed attenuation parameters and, thus, more accurate stellar parameters. The observations in the far-IR for a large number of galaxies have mainly happened over the last decade with space-based telescopes, especially Herschel. This information will allow you to appreciate the sample that we have chosen for our study. Stripe 82 is a 220-square-degree patch in the Northern Hemisphere of the sky. It has been the focus of many deep multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic surveys. Thanks to that, it has the range of most accurate dust attenuation and structural and stellar parameters computed through various dedicated efforts. What we have done is that we have used all this information to probe the dependence of the shape of the dust attenuation curve on all other galaxy properties. This kind of observational undertaking is possible now with the availability of all the defining galaxy parameters for a large sample of local galaxies. Deciphering the dependence of dust on other galaxy properties is fundamental in our pursuit of understanding the processes that have governed the growth of galaxies. There is growing evidence that galaxies with different morphology types have witnessed characteristically different evolutionary paths. For example, ellipticals are understood to form during major mergers, and discs might have formed later through accretion, minor mergers, and secular evolution. If we are able to quantify the difference in their dust content and attenuation properties, we can obtain more insight into the dominant physical processes. So we have a sample of nearly 17000 local galaxies, covering the entire mass range. We divide these galaxies based on their dominant structural component, that is, if majorly the galaxy has a spheroid or elliptical-like structure or if it’s mainly a disc-like structure. This classification is achieved with the application of multiple stringent criteria that include the placement of galaxies on the projection of the fundamental plane and the value of their global Sersic index. The sersic index defines the shape of a galaxy’s light profile. Galaxies with dominant spheroid components will follow the tight fundamental plane relation observed for local ellipticals, while those with dominant disc components will be outliers to such a relation. Galaxies that didn’t comply with the stringent multiple criteria were kept separately so as not to contaminate the two classifications. We found that the normalized slope of the attenuation curve is markedly different for the two structural types. The curve is twice as shallow for discs as it is for spheroids (see Figure 2). However, for the whole group of a given structural type, the slope values are constrained within a narrow range. Thus the shape of the dust attenuation curve is dependent on the dominant mode of stellar mass distribution inside a galaxy. Similar to structure, the curve is nearly twice as shallow for star-forming galaxies as for passive galaxies. We divide the galaxies into star-forming and passive based on their placement on the main sequence.     Figure 2. The fractional distribution of various structural types of galaxies, i. e. , spheroid-dominated (red), disc-dominated (blue), and the rest (green), is shown with respect to the normalized slope of their dust attenuation curves in UV (R FUV ). Discs exhibit shallower slopes than spheroids emphasizing the role of structure in determining dust properties. This dependence of the attenuation curve on star formation rate could be driven by the structure because discs are star-forming and spheroids are passive. But also, star-forming galaxies will have more dust clouds in addition to the diffuse interstellar medium. Either way, this adds to the evidence that the distribution of stars and dust inside a galaxy determines the curve properties. Another interesting thing to note is that the amount of dust is irrelevant to the shape. That’s why we see no correlation between the normalized shape and the total mass of the galaxy or the inclination of its disc component. Although more mass and higher inclination will result in the stellar light encountering more dust before reaching the observer, it doesn’t affect the shape of the curve. So, rather than the amount of dust encountered by the stellar light, it is the placement of the dust vis-a-vis the stars that determine the attenuation properties. Thus, all evidence suggests that it is the distribution of dust vis-a-vis various stellar populations that determines its behavior, i. e. , star-dust geometry is the main determinant of the dust attenuation properties. More Formal DescriptionStar-dust geometry: main determinant of dust attenuation in galaxies Dust is as crucial a component of a galaxy and as omnipresent as stars, gas, and dark matter. Its importance can be gauged from the fact that it reprocesses more than half of the galaxy’s stellar light. The dust properties (mainly its amount and constituents) inside a galaxy depend on the star formation history of that galaxy. In addition to that, the dust properties of a galaxy are a critical determinant of its future star formation activity. Unraveling the connection between the properties of dust and its host galaxy is, therefore, a powerful diagnostic for the processes involved in its evolution (Dunne et al. 2011; Santini et al. 2014). The properties of dust inside a galaxy are deduced by analyzing its effect on the galaxy’s stellar emission over the spectrum (Calzetti 1997; Draine 2003). This effect of dust is accounted for through the dust attenuation curve of a galaxy. The dust attenuation curve gives the optical depth of a galaxy over the spectrum, i. e. , it describes how a galaxy’s light is affected by dust at each wavelength. So a general attenuation curve peaks at far UV and becomes negligible by the time it reaches IR. Constant efforts are made to compute attenuation curves for galaxies in a robust manner as it is a prerequisite for estimating galaxies’ stellar mass and star formation rate (Walcher et al. 2011; Conroy 2013). The method that has lately gained traction for providing the most reliable attenuation curves for galaxies individually is the ‘model method’. This involves the creation of a library of dust-free spectrums or Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) spanning a large range of star formation histories and metallicities through the usage of stellar population synthesis models. The dust-free SEDs are then attenuated and compared with observed SEDs to obtain estimates of galaxy parameters and dust content. Recently, Salim et al. (2018) implemented the ‘energy balanced SED fitting’ technique on a quarter million local galaxies with far-UV to far-IR observations resulting in a detailed set of dust attenuation parameters for galaxies individually, covering the whole mass and stellar activity range. For Stripe 82 - a 270 square degrees area in the sky - spectra as well as deep images are available for tens of thousands of local galaxies (Dawson et al. 2013; Annis et al. 2014). Utilizing that, Bottrell et al. (2019) have computed a detailed set of structural parameters (like size, ellipticity, bulge-to-total ratio, etc. ) for all galaxies (∼17000) in this area in optical wavebands. Thus, detailed structural, stellar, and attenuation curve defining parameters - understood to be the most accurate to date - are available for all (∼17000) galaxies in the Stripe 82 region. In our work, we employ this data to perform a detailed investigation of the processes and properties responsible for the observed variation in dust attenuation parameters of galaxies covering the entire mass and stellar activity range. We probed the cause of variation in the dust attenuation curves of galaxies by studying the trend of the normalized attenuation slope in the ultraviolet with the structure, star formation activity, total stellar mass, inclination, and optical depth of galaxies. The main findings are discussed:  The attenuation curve for spheroid-dominated galaxies is twice as steep as that for disc-dominated ones. Both structural types occupy non-overlapping ranges of the attenuation slope value (10-20% overlap). Thus, stellar mass distribution within the galaxy is one of the main determinants of its dust attenuation behavior. More importantly, within a structural group, i. e. , that of discs, slope values are constrained to a narrow range, emphasizing the primacy of structure in determining dust properties.  The steepness of the attenuation curve for spheroids is driven by minimal attenuation in the optical bands compared to that in the ultraviolet. Thus, only newly formed stars get attenuated in the case of spheroids. In contrast, the shallowness of the curve in the case of discs is driven by near-uniform attenuation in UV and optical bands. Thus, all stars face attenuation in the case of discs, both due to a more dominant presence of ‘birth clouds’ and a denser interstellar medium (Charlot &amp; Fall, 2000).  The trends observed in the case of the structure are reflected in the case of star formation activity as well. The slope for passive galaxies is twice as steep as that for star-forming ones. This is expected because most (&gt;85-90%) discs are star-forming, and spheroids are passive. Since star-forming galaxies are more gas-rich, clumpier and have a larger presence of birth clouds compared to passive galaxies, it provides further evidence that the distribution of stellar mass and dust inside a galaxy is the main cause of variation in attenuation curves (Inoue 2005).   All our findings add up to the argument that if the extinction curve is assumed to be universal, the distribution of stars and dust, i. e. , star-dust geometry, is the primal determinant of the attenuation properties of a galaxy. Recently, under similar assumptions, Narayanan et al. (2018) have shown through simulations that star-dust geometry drives the variation in attenuation curves. Our results confirm that.

    "title": "Spreading the joy of science - The science outreach activities during the Young Astronomer’s Meeting, 2022",
    "body": "2023/02/03 -  A summary of science outreach performed during the Young Astronomer’s Meeting, 2022.  The human mind is always curious and questioning. It has a very compulsive behavior of asking “why,” “how,” and sometimes “what if?”. As Farhan Akhtar sings in the movie Rock On!! (2008), “Why is the sky blue, why is the water wet, and why is the Earth round? Socha hai? Ye tumne kya kabhi?”, meaning “Have you ever thought of this?”. Curiosity is one of the most fundamental qualities of humans and is unbridled in children. Children ask questions that are sometimes startlingly profound - “Why is the North of a magnet attracted to the South?”. Such questions are crucial to understanding the world around us and the very nature of our existence! Science is generally approached in schools as a collection of facts about the world, with a smattering of numerical problems. However, this is hardly the case. Science is a method or a prescription for understanding the world. Typically, we perceive (see or hear or taste, for example) the world and are driven by an innate curiosity as to how the world functions. To answer this curiosity, we come up with reasons – some may be correct, but others may be utterly wrong. How do we decide this? Through the scientific method! Each reason may give rise to multiple testable results, which we then compare against the things we see or infer. We keep updating our different “reasons” if they fail and try to come up with a general picture of the world. If any person tests out these different “reasons,” they should also come up with the same answer – and then we would know if our understanding of the world is correct! The Young Astronomers Meet (YAM) is a meeting of only research scholars in astronomy and astrophysics in India. This meeting is of the scholars, for the scholars, and by the scholars. After a “coronal hiatus,” the meeting was held this year at the Aryabhatta Research Institute of observational sciencES (ARIES) in Nainital between 9th-13th November. As research scholars aiming to be professional scientists in the future, we ought to share our understanding, enthusiasm, and excitement about the scientific analysis of the world with everyone. With this in mind, the YAM committee organized a series of outreach activities aimed mainly at school children. The unbridled enthusiasm and curiosity of school children are an excellent motivator for the research scholars who were on the other side just a decade ago. The outreach activities were initiated by Dr. Virendra Yadav of ARIES/ASI-POEC and brought into shape by Mr. Atharva Pathak of Pune Knowledge Cluster, who was earlier with the IUCAA Science Popularization team. Along with the two experts were the YAM chair Vivek Jha, YAM coordinator Dimple, and YAM SOC member/ CosmicVarta editorial team member Vishal1, who edited and finalized the outreach program. This complete team had almost more than 15 research scholars who volunteered from purchasing materials to conducting outreach! The initial outreach sessionIn general, the schools had requested outreach sessions for a specific range of classes. For example, students between classes 6th to 8th formed one batch, and those from 9th to 12th included another. On the first day of YAM, we were yet to receive a full confirmation from various schools which had been approached. One school – Dikshant International, Haldwani – had confirmed the outreach session for both batches on the 10th of November, 2022. So on the 9th, Atharva, Virendra, Dimple, Vivek, and I sat down with the set of experiments and demonstrations of IUCAA Scip-pop brought by Atharva. Every region, every school, and every batch is unique. Hence, we selected an initial set of demonstrations suitable for the two batches of students. The initial preparation was extremely important – the demonstrations had traveled all the way from Pune to Nainital and had to be in perfect condition to work. Thus, we narrowed down a couple of demonstrations and presentations to be showcased to the students. The team on the first day was led by both Atharva and Virendra. It consisted of Sreetama Das Choudhury and Samik Mitra from IIT Guwahati, Priyesh Tripathi from ARIES, Ajay Kumar from NCRA, Pune, and myself. The outreach started with the senior batch students, to whom Virendra introduced astronomy and ARIES. This was followed by a set of demonstrations led by Atharva and the volunteers, involving participation from the crowd as “student volunteers. ” A part of the team then led these students for sunspot observations through the 5” Cassegrain telescope. The junior batch students were presented with most of the demonstrations – however, this crowd was more challenging to control, with the time running short. Thus, while the volunteers conducted the demonstrations, each step and reasoning was interactively performed, with the students sometimes shouting an answer in unison! Finally, these students were shown sunspots through the telescope, and the sessions concluded with an informal interaction with the outreach team and teachers.   Outreach sessions at Dikshant International. Top: The research scholar volunteers with the school students. Bottom: A talk by Dr. Virendra Yadav is underway. Learning from feedbackThe sessions at Dikshant International were a big hit and taught us many things. First, the younger students were typically chaotic and easily fascinated by science experiments – especially those making a lot of noise or being disruptive. These kids were not very interested in any presentation unless it was highly captivating. Second, the older students showed a greater inclination toward the presentations. Furthermore, the presentations were effective if they were relevant to the experiment being performed. We had confirmed attendance at four schools the next day (11th November). Since the demos were limited in number, we had to select demos that may be showcased at these different schools and make multiple copies of each demo for each school. Taking all this data, we formulated a plan of action. The subsequent sessions would have the sunspot observation as the epicenter, and from thereon, we would diversify to different topics. Each session would first start with sunspot observations, giving an observational treat. Next, we would have a presentation on sunspots with lots of visuals. Then, we change tracks to the experiments: (i). Demonstration of magnetic levitation – an extension of the magnetic nature of sunspots, (ii). Mixing of different colours of light, and the meaning of “electromagnetic spectrum” (iii). The demonstration of transverse and longitudinal waves and energy transfer using a slinky-like construction (iv). The dependence of pitch of the sound on the length of the air/water column, using two demonstrations, (v). Concave and convex mirror and lens demonstration, and (vi). The application of an astrolabe to find the coordinates of objects in the sky. The session would then end with slides on ARIES and YAM. With our demos confirmed, we needed to replicate them. Volunteers from ARIES stepped up to perform the purchase. The demonstrations are constructed with simple, day-to-day objects: colored papers, pencils, plastic straws, sponges, and protractors, for example!  Session planning, demonstration construction, and presentation curation by the YAM attendees.  Since there were four schools with four volunteers per team, we needed around 16 volunteers for our team. The YAM attendees enthusiastically turned up to volunteer for the outreach and were split into different teams. Each team had a lead and a set of volunteers trained and readied for the outreach. Large-scale outreach sessionTwo large cars containing two teams each left ARIES early in the morning after breakfast on the 11th. The schools gave timings for conducting the sessions, so we had to ensure there was correct coordination, for we only had two telescopes for four schools. The outreach plan was to go to the first school, perform sunspot observations, and let the second team take the telescope to the next school. The four schools that had requested outreach were Shemford, Sacred Heart, Aurum Global, and Aryaman Vikram Birla Institute of Learning. Atharva, Virendra, Gourav, and I led the teams at different schools. In Atharva’s team were Eshita Banerjee (IUCAA) and Kiran Wani (ARIES), while in Virendra’s team were Sayak Dutta, Suraj Dhiwar (IUCAA), and Vikas Rawat (ARIES). Gourav Banerjee of CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Bangalore led Anju Panthi (BITS Pilani), Mizna Ashraf (IISER Tirupati), and Arpit Kumar Shrivastav (ARIES), while I led Pranshu Kumar, Bhavya Ailawadhi and Prajjwal Rawat from ARIES.   Outreach at Aryaman school, with the sunspot observations (top) and demonstrations (bottom).   Outreach session and demonstrations at Aurum school   Outreach session and demonstrations at Sacred heart school   Outreach session and demonstrations at Shemford school  The outreach events went almost perfectly according to our plans. Since each team had a leader with prior experience performing science outreach, the teams adapted to the student’s responses. We aimed not just to showcase experiments but to inculcate excitement and develop an innate curiosity about the world. Thus, depending on which demos were well received, the teams tinkered with the order and the set of demos to be presented. The junior batch students were extremely chaotic. Navigating the chaotic energy is a major task in itself, but in general, all the volunteers were amazed by the observation skills and thought processes of these kids. The students were attentive to what we spoke about and asked some questions which, at a scientific level, were quite profound! Also, we noticed that the little things we do significantly impact kids with confidence issues. A little encouragement to such kids to come onto the stage and perform the demos has quite an impact on these kids. In fact, some of these kids stayed much later to chat with us and thanked us for giving them an opportunity on stage! On the 12th of November, a final outreach session was planned for senior batch students at Longview Public school with the same demos. This school was not in the plains of Haldwani but rather in the mountains of Nainital. This session was undertaken by Virendra, Kiran, and Pranshu and joined by Srashti Goyal of ICTS.   Outreach session and demonstrations at Longview school Wrapping up and next stepsThe science demos we created for individual schools were given away to these schools to let the teachers perform such demonstrations. In most schools, the teachers showed as much enthusiasm as the students while the demos were underway. This is critically important in inculcating love, excitement for the scientific process, and a general curiosity about the world. Dr. Virendra Yadav, the co-chair of the Outreach team of the Astronomical Society of India, presented a summary report to ASI on the conducted outreach sessions. The team of volunteers hopes that the YAM outreach becomes a standard template of outreach to be followed as a part of any conference/meeting occurring within India; looking forward to increased participation and sharing our scientific enthusiasm!

    "title": "Astronomers find cold atomic gas playing peek-a-boo around a powerful quasar",
    "body": "2023/01/24 -  The interaction of radio jets with gas associated with the host galaxy could play an important role in determining their morphology.  Such interactions may be more prevalent at high redshifts, when these powerful AGN are still the assembly sites of giant galaxies.    Fig. 1 The canonical model of AGN (Credit: Aurore Simonnet, Sonoma State University) The active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most luminous sources in the Universe. Their energy output is fuelled by the supply of gas to the central engine, i. e. , a supermassive black hole (SMBH) through an accretion disk (see Fig. 1).  The detection of Lyman-alpha emission from neutral hydrogen (HI) has established that the powerful AGN at high redshift are embedded in huge (10 - 100 kpc) gaseous halos of diffuse atomic gas.  The observations of absorption lines detected in the spectra of AGN can provide crucial insights into the processes through which gas at large scales can be transported to the circumnuclear disk to fuel the central engine. Gupta et al. (2022, ApJL, 927, L24) recently used the Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) in South Africa and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) in the USA to discover a curious case of high HI column density absorber that exhibits strong HI 21-cm absorption at radio wavelengths but is absent at optical wavelength! SALT is the largest single optical telescope in the southern hemisphere whereas VLBA is a radio interferometer consisting of 10 identical antennas, separated by distances from 200 km to transcontinental 8600 km.   Fig. 2 HI 21-cm absorption line associated with the powerful AGN M1540-1453.  Note that the HI 21-cm line (rest frequency of 1420. 405752 MHz) is redshifted to ~456. 2 MHz. The large reservoir of cold HI gas associated with the quasar M1540-1453 at the redshift of z = 2. 104 was discovered using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in India.  The corresponding HI 21-cm absorption profile is shown in Fig. 2.  It doesn’t exhibit any unusual features except that such absorbers have been difficult to find at high redshifts and only four are known at z &gt; 2.  To understand the origin of detected cold gas, Gupta et al. observed M1540-1453 with SALT to detect the strong Lyman-alpha (Lyα) absorption corresponding to the gas detected with uGMRT.  But to their surprise, no such absorption was detected in the optical spectrum (see Fig. 3).  Also, in comparison to typical quasars, the Lyα emission line associated with the AGN is much narrower.   Fig. 3 SALT spectrum of M1540-1453.  Note the absence of strong HI Lyman alpha absorption.  The blue curve represents the absorption profile expected on the basis of absorption detected in the uGMRT spectrum at radio wavelengths.   Fig. 4 VLBA image revealing the diffuse radio morphology of M1540-1453. In comparison to optical, in general the radio emission associated with AGN is much more spatially extended. This difference can be used to explain such ambiguities in the radio and optical spectra. To dissect this further and understand the ghostly nature of this HI absorber, Gupta et al. observed M1540-1453 with VLBA.  Usually, one expects radio emission associated with such powerful AGN to exhibit well collimated radio jets and lobes (see Fig. 1). However, the milliarcsecond-scale resolution observation of M1540-1453 shows a diffuse morphology (Fig. 4), which implies that the gas in front of it, which is producing absorption, is also not a few localized gas clumps, but rather forms a clumpy shell or halo which could be as large as 10 kpc (see Fig. 5). It is conjectured that this HI shell represents infalling gas clouds that may have been blown by the interaction between radio jets and the host galaxy medium.   Fig. 5: Cartoon depicting a quadrant of M1540–1453 embedded in a clumpy ISM. The quasar’s optical sight line (dashed line) may not intercept infalling HI clouds. In comparison, extended radio emission (&gt; 425 pc) from the lobes will be intercepted by several such clouds, producing the broad redshifted HI 21 cm absorption line. The extent of the HI halo and radio emission could be as large as 10 kpc.  The quasar M1540-1453 was discovered through an ambitious spectroscopic survey using SALT (180 hrs) and the Nordic Optical Telescopes (6 nights) to build a purely infrared-selected sample of radio-loud quasars (RLQs) at z &gt; 1. 5 and define the footprint of the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS; PI: N. Gupta).  MALS is one of the ten large surveys being carried out with the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa. In the coming years, MALS is expected to detect several such absorbers that may have escaped detection at other wavelengths, and address various fundamental issues related to AGN.

    "title": "A comparison of the properties of Narrow Line and the Broad Line Seyfert galaxies",
    "body": "2023/01/13 -  AGNs are very luminous objects at the centre of active galaxies. The inner regions of these galaxies can not be resolved directly, yet the understanding of these regions can be achieved by employing indirect methods. In this study, we employed a statistical approach to understand a very peculiar class of AGN with respect to the general AGN population- the Narrow Line Seyfert galaxies, and have found out that emission line region outflows exist in the innermost regions of these AGN which adds another peculiarity to their behaviour.  Recent discoveries have pointed out that a supermassive black hole (SMBH) exists in the centre of the galaxies, with mass ranging from a million to a billion solar masses. This central black hole accretes matter at a very high rate. In turn, an accretion disk is formed and it radiates a luminosity ranging from a billion to a trillion times the luminosity of the Sun! This animation is an artistic impression of the inner regions of an active galaxy. The animation starts with the optical image of 3C273, a very well-known quasar, and zooms in up to the sub-parsec scale, where the clumps of gas known as the Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds exist embedded beneath a torus of dust. (Video Courtesy: ESO YouTube channel) These kinds of galaxies are called active galaxies, or more popularly these objects are called Quasars. Quasars were discovered to be very luminous extragalactic objects only in 1963, through the work of Martin Schmidt. In research, various names: Active galactic Nuclei (AGN), Quasars, Blazar, Seyferts, etc. are known (see this for detailed information about the Quasars). Commonly, people use AGN as a generic term, while Quasar is used for AGNs having higher luminosities (&gt; 1e44 ergs/sec). Seyferts are the AGN that are a little less luminous than Quasars. Type-1 AGN are the ones where the observer is able to view the innermost regions comprising the accretion disk and the BLR without any obscuration, while in the Type-2 AGN, the dusty torus obscures the innermost regions. Among the type 1 Seyferts, a peculiar class of galaxies known as the Narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies is known to exist. These are young AGN, with very high accretion rates. The study of these objects provides clues to the understanding of the formation and growth of AGNs.   The Unified Model for AGN accounts for various properties observed in AGN. This simple model differentiates between the various classes based on the orientation with respect to the observer. (Image courtesy) In this work, we have studied the properties of these NLSy1 galaxies as compared to the general type-1 AGN which we term Broad-line Seyfert galaxies (BLSy1) galaxies. We achieved this by collecting optical spectra for a sample of about 260 galaxies. We searched for the spectra in the publicly available SDSS database. SDSS provides information for hundreds and thousands of such objects on their server. We assembled a set of 144 NLSy1 and 117 BLSy1 galaxies which are in a similar luminosity and redshift range.   The multiple-component spectral decomposition was applied to fit one of the sources in this study. (Image courtesy) After fitting the spectra by employing a multi-component spectral decomposition technique, we studied a set of 11 physical parameters to compare these two populations. It is very important to know that the exact relation of the NLSy1 galaxies with the BLSy1 galaxies remains unknown for the general AGN population. We characterized the population of these galaxies based on the asymmetry observed in a very prominent emission line: the H-beta emission line. In our sample, we found out the NLSy1 galaxies are 3 times more likely to show emission line asymmetries as compared to the BLSy1 galaxies population. This result is very important in our understanding of the difference between these two populations. Note that the emission lines are generated in the Broad-line Region (BLR) of these AGNs, and this region cannot be resolved by any observation technique at present. Thus, we are reliant on indirect tools to infer the dynamics of matter in these regions. In this regard, emission line asymmetries encode information about the dynamics of matter at the location from where they are emitted and thus it becomes necessary to characterize. The outflows may also be due to the winds arising from the accretion disk in these AGNs, which influences our understanding and further modelling of the AGN accretion disks.   A cluster map showing the correlations between 11 parameters.  (Image courtesy) We calculated the Spearman rank correlation coefficients among the parameters. We found that the accretion rate characterized by the Eddington Ratio is anti-correlated with the FWHM of the H-beta emission line which means the AGNs which are accreting at a faster rate, will have narrower emission profiles. Further, we ran a Principal component analysis (PCA) on the data to understand the parameters deriving the correlations and anti-correlations. Basically, PCA reduces the dimensions of the dataset in the sense that what we were able to derive based on 11 physical parameters, we could do with fewer principal components. This helps us understand the underlying correlations among the fewer parameters. Based on the results from the PCA, we find out that the Eigenvectors 1 and 2 of the PCA are a bit different for both populations. What can be the possible reason behind this?  The main sequence of quasars obtained from the recent studies. (Image courtesy) Importantly, based on an ensemble study of around 500,000 AGN, Shen et al. 2014 reported the same Eigenvector correlation as has been observed in this study. This is significant because it points out that AGN located in different redshifts and luminosity bins show similar properties which can be arranged to form a sort of main sequence. The main sequence is a very neat way to arrange the population of stars based on the luminosities and their age. A similar main sequence for the AGN has been proposed based on this correlation. Are the Eigenvectors telling a different story? We don’t know yet. However, we can safely say that the NLSy1 galaxies form the extreme end of the AGN population with very high accretion rates and low SMBH masses. The discovery of significant emission line asymmetries in the NLSy1 galaxies means that outflowing gas is indeed present in the line emitting regions. Similar studies covering a larger population will be very helpful in our understanding of the peculiarity of these AGNs.

    "title": "3.6m DOT discovered unexpected kilonova emission from a long-duration gamma-ray burst",
    "body": "2023/01/12 -  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are flashes of high-energy radiation arising from energetic cosmic explosions. Bursts of long (greater than two seconds) duration are produced by the core-collapse of massive stars, and those of short (less than two seconds) duration by the merger of compact objects, such as two neutron stars. A third class of events with hybrid high-energy properties was identified, but never conclusively linked to a stellar progenitor. The lack of bright supernovae rules out typical core-collapse explosions, but their distance scales prevent sensitive searches for direct signatures of a progenitor system. Only tentative evidence for a kilonova has been presented. Here we report observations of the exceptionally bright GRB 211211A, which classify it as a hybrid event and constrain its distance scale to only 346 megaparsecs. Our measurements indicate that its lower-energy (from ultraviolet to near-infrared) counterpart is powered by a luminous kilonova possibly formed in the ejecta of a compact object merger. To study the aftermath of this long GRB, we used several telescopes in space and on Earth, in which the 3. 6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope of the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) played a significant role.  Some massive stars die as the brightest and most explosive astrophysical sources in the universe, known as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). GRBs are powerful astronomical bursts of high-energy gamma-ray radiation and are one of the most interesting and scientifically fulfilling phenomena studied in modern astronomy. GRB events have two distinct emission phases: one is the short-lived prompt emission (the initial burst phase, that emits gamma-rays), followed by a long-lived multiwavelength afterglow phase. For the past few decades, based on the observed time scale of prompt emission, astronomers have generally divided GRBs into two categories: long and short-duration GRBs, respectively. Long GRBs typically emit gamma rays for two seconds or more. They are associated with the death of very massive stars and are sometimes associated with supernovae. On the other hand, Short GRBs emit gamma rays for short periods of less than two seconds. This class of GRBs is formed when pairs of very dense celestial bodies (compact) - such as neutron stars or black holes - merge with each other, rotating in a spiral form over a period of billions of years. They also generate gravitational waves. In recent years, scientists have discovered a special phenomenon called a kilonova of visible and infrared light with short-period GRBs. According to a possible scientific hypothesis, the heat produced by the radioactive decay of heavier elements may emit kilonova. This process, known in physics as the r and s process, also produces heavier elements such as gold and platinum. However, observing kilonovas at near-infrared wavelengths is technically challenging, and only a few telescopes on Earth have been useful. The 3. 6-meter Devasthal Optical Telescope (see Figure 1) of the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), is one such telescope that is sensitive enough to detect kilonova and optical/near-IR counterparts of gravitational wave objects at these wavelengths up to faint limits. On December 11, 2021, NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected a burst of high-energy light (GRB 211211A) from the outskirts of the Milky Way located approximately 1 billion light-years away. To study the aftermath of this long GRB, astronomers used several telescopes in space and on Earth, in which the 3. 6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope of the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) played a very important role (see Figure 2). The spectral energy distribution of GRB afterglow is usually explained in terms of non-thermal emission (due to synchrotron radiation). However, in this event, both thermal and non-thermal emissions are included in the spectral energy distribution of the afterglow, modeled using the magnificent and dim observations of the 3. 6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope. After subtracting the afterglow contribution from the collected data taken using the 3. 6 m telescope and 4Kx4K CCD IMAGER, the scientists found that the multiwavelength data could be well explained by additional thermal spectra and that this thermal emission could be explained in terms of kilonova emission. This is the first astronomical event in which a long GRB has been accompanied by the unexpected discovery of a kilonova emission, and has shaken the understanding of scientists. In this event, the high-energy outburst lasted about a minute, and follow-up observations taken from the 3. 6-meter Devasthal Optical Telescope identified a kilonova. Observations by the 3. 6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope have provided information on the earliest phase of a kilonova ever detected. In addition to the first data taken by the 3. 6-meter telescope, this scientific discovery, published in the journal Nature, also used Hubble Space Telescope, Multicolor Imaging Telescopes for Survey and Monstrous Explosions, Calar Alto Observatory, Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope, and many other space and ground-based telescopes. This discovery will help in understanding the process of the formation of heavy elements in the universe.   Figure 1: 3. 6m Devasthal Optical Telescope installed at Devasthal Observatory of Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital.  “Several years ago, Neil Gehrels, an astrophysicist, and namesake of Swift suggested that some long-duration GRBs may be produced by merging neutron stars,” said Eleonora Troja, an astrophysicist at the University of Rome who led the team on the study. By GRB standards, this event was relatively nearby, allowing space and ground-based telescopes to capture the dim light of the kilonova. Kilonovae may also arise from more distant long GRBs, but we have not yet been able to see them through observations. PI of the 4Kx4K CCD IMAGER mounted on ARIES’ 3. 6-meter telescope, senior Scientist Dr. Shashi Bhushan Pandey, along with research students Rahul Gupta, Amar Aryan, Amit Kumar, and Senior Scientist Kuntal Mishra, contributed significantly to the discovery of this milestone event published in the journal Nature on 07-12-2022 at 16:00 (London time). Dr. Shashi Bhushan Pandey and the team of Indian scientists involved in this work said that this discovery challenges our current understanding of the origin of GRBs and gives rise to new possibilities in this thrust area of research. Professor Dipankar Banerjee, director of ARIES, pointed out that future time-domain astronomy has a unique potential to make a lot of such discoveries using the 3. 6m Devasthal optical telescope.   Figure 2: The temporal evolution of optical emission (in R band) from GRB 211211A based on DOT data. The scientists from the ARIES, an autonomous institute of DST, used data from 3. 6m DOT, in studying the aftermath of the long GRB (GRB 211211A), detected by NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope on December 11, 2021. The high-energy outburst lasted about a minute, and follow-up observations taken from the 3. 6-meter Devasthal Optical Telescope identified a kilonova.  This discovery opens new questions regarding the origin and classification of GRBs. These sources’ unique gravitational wave signatures could be the key to unraveling the mystery. The gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA did not detect GRB 211211A, as these detectors were offline for advancements. Suppose gravitational wave detectors can see a long-duration GRB after they begin operating again in 2023. In that case, the combination of gravitational wave and electromagnetic data may solve the mystery of this newly discovered event.

    "title": "Fantastic beasts and where to find them: the elusive nature of X-ray quiet black holes",
    "body": "2023/01/03 -  With the gravitational wave observations capturing the coalescence of compact objects, hunting for black holes has taken quite a front-row seat in astronomical observations. Here, we discuss two such detection of black holes in orbit with a main sequence companion, and why it is very difficult to find them in the forest of massive stars.  IntroductionMassive stars are objects that are more massive than eight times the mass of our Sun (M⊙). They play an essential role in the evolution of our Universe. They enrich the void between stars with matter via strong winds and provide mechanical feedback. However, many aspects of massive star evolution are still unconstrained, such as their wind mass-loss rates, the mixing efficiency inside their surface, and their death. Massive stars that are heavier than ~20 M⊙ are thought to collapse directly to form black holes. Expectantly, there are many uncertainties such as the mass range for black hole formation, the natal kick imparted during the black hole formation due to asymmetric collapse,and the spin of the resultant black hole. The gravitational wave detectors have already observed ~90 compact object merger events involving black holes and neutron stars. However, more than a million black holes are predicted to be present in our Galaxy itself, waiting to be discovered. So, observationally detecting a large sample of black holes can shed necessary light on their formation properties and their subsequent evolution. Empirically, massive stars have been observed to exist in binaries and higher order multiples, with about three out of every 100 massive star binary above 10M⊙ expected to harbour a black hole as its companion. However, a large fraction of these binaries that will eventually form double compact object binaries will not merge within the current age of our Universe. Hence, they will remain unobservable in the current gravitational wave surveys. Nevertheless, progress can be made to discover these black holes while they are in orbit with a massive star companion, where they are detectable via alternative methods. This is possible, for example, by measuring the X-ray emission from the accretion disk of the black hole, the radial velocity variations in the spectral lines1 of the massive main sequence companion, and through periodic astrometric variations2 or photometric variability3 of the massive star companion induced by the black hole. ResultsBlack holes in binaries are thought to form from the collapse of massive Wolf-Rayet stars, which are very hot and bright stars that show emission lines in their spectrum. Now, there are many observed Wolf-Rayet+O star binaries in our Galaxy (~80) compared to observed black hole+O star binaries (only one, Cyg X-1). To resolve this disparity, it was recently suggested that black holes receive a significant natal kick when the Wolf-Rayet stars collapse to form a black hole, disrupting the binary. Since black holes do not emit any light of their own, we need to rely on the indirect ways discussed above to observe a black hole. The most common method has been to detect X-rays from the accretion disk around the black hole in a binary with the O star companion. Some of the wind matter from the companion gets attracted by the gravity of the black hole, and if that matter falling into it has enough angular momentum, it can form a disk before being engulfed by the black hole. The matter then swirls around the black hole multiple times, gets heated up to millions of degrees, and gets hot enough to emit X-rays. Bondi, Hoyle and Lyttleton did pioneering work in this field in the 1940s. However, we find that such wind accretion in our black hole+O star binary models is not expected to lead to observable X-ray emission. Only in exceptionally favourable cases, such as high angular momentum accretion efficiency and low wind velocities, can an accretion disk form, leading to observable X-ray emission. Moreover, the formation of an accretion disk is also biased towards binaries containing rapidly spinning black holes. The first-born black hole in a massive binary is expected to be slowly spinning due to efficient angular momentum transport inside a star. The wind velocity of O stars is very high (~2000 km/s), empirically verified through observations. Detailed hydrodynamic calculations predict only one-third of the angular momentum available is accreted by the black hole. Hence, most black holes in orbit with an O star are not expected to form an accretion disk and remain unobservant via X-ray telescopes. So, the discrepancy in the number of observed Wolf-Rayet+O star binaries in comparison to black hole+O star binaries may be due to the lack of observability of the black hole binaries in X-rays. We conclude that high black hole natal kicks are not necessary to explain the scarcity of observed high-mass X-ray binaries. Instead, searching for black holes via alternative methods may be more fruitful. One alternative would be to search for black holes in our Milky Way via astrometric variations in visible stars - that is, variations in the precise measurements of the position of stars in the sky. This method has been shown to be very promising as our Milky Way is expected to harbour millions of black holes in orbit with main sequence companions whose astrometry can be carried out in principle by the GAIA telescope. Unfortunately, the GAIA Data Release 3 did not have the relevant data for stars massive enough to host black holes, and hence this method could not be pursued. Thus in this work, we look at radial velocity variations of observed massive stars. We have a nearly complete census of the massive star content in the Tarantula nebula of Large Magellanic Cloud, which enables us to also carry out precise number statistics for the massive stars in this region. In fact, it is the most active star-forming region known in the Local Group of galaxies containing very massive stars with a metallicity resembling the peak of star formation in our Universe. The radial velocity of stars is measured by observing the Doppler shift in a prominent spectral line of the star. As the star moves around in one full orbit, the spectral lines are blue-shifted for half of the orbit and red-shifted for the remaining orbit. When we see a Doppler shift in a spectral line of a stellar object both towards the bluer and redder wavelengths simultaneously, we identify the object as a double-lined spectroscopic binary. This is because both the components of the binary are responsible for creating the Doppler shifts in opposite directions, one moving towards us in orbit and the other away from us. When we see a Doppler shift in only one direction, we identify the object as a single-lined spectroscopic binary. This is because the companion star is usually too faint for its spectral line to be detected. Or, in the most interesting case, the companion is a compact object which does not emit any light of its own. We identify the single-lined spectroscopic binaries in the sample of massive stars observed in the Tarantula region. The VLT Flames Tarantula Survey observed approximately 800 massive stars, out of which 300 were O-type stars. From these, around 100 targets that showed radial velocity variations were followed up in the Tarantula Massive Binary Monitoring Survey. Of these, 51 of them were categorised as single-lined spectroscopic binaries. Through follow-up spectral disentangling, we retrieved hidden spectra in 43 of these targets. For the remaining targets where we were not able to find a non-degenerate companion, three of them had an estimated minimum mass of the unseen companion above 4M⊙.   Fig. 1 : Visualisation of the BH+O star binary VFTS 243, a 10. 4 d-period binary with a (near-)circular orbit situated in the Tarantula nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud (credit: Isca Mayo / Sara Pinilla). The sizes of the star, black hole, and orbits are not to scale. Of the above, we were able to find unambiguous evidence for the presence of a 9. 1M⊙ object in the system named VFTS 243. The orbital period of this system is 10. 4 days and the orbit is also circular. Through follow-up rigorous analysis, we arrive at the conclusion that the object is a black hole, the first one detected in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The system is also X-ray quiet, in agreement with our earlier study on the X-ray emission from black hole + main sequence systems. The above number statistics show how big an observing program needs to be undertaken to unambiguously find black holes via radial velocity monitoring of observed massive stars. In the Milky Way, we have found another system, HD 130298, that could be another candidate to host a stellar-mass black hole. Our journey towards identifying a population of X-ray quiet black holes has only started, and we aim to slowly but surely hunt them down, through future observational surveys, one black hole at a time.

    "title": "Precise Measurement of Flux Density of Radio Emissions from the Sun using Day-time Celestial Radio Sources",
    "body": "2023/01/03 -  During astronomical observation, astronomers measure the amount of energy emitted by astronomical objects. This energy is generally measured in terms of the flux density of the source. At radio frequencies, these measurements are calibrated using calibrator sources, which have known constant flux densities. Since the Sun is about 1000 times brighter at radio frequencies than the calibrator sources, estimating the flux density of the solar radio emission is challenging. With the new generation radio telescope, the Murchison Widefield Array, it is now possible to observe the faint background radio sources simultaneously with the Sun. This is the first such an observation has been made, which seems like “observing stars in the day”. Using these background radio sources it is now possible to estimate the flux density of the solar radio emission with much better accuracy, which is important to understand the emission mechanisms of solar radio emissions.  IntroductionIn most physics experiments, researchers measure various quantities in different units, like the mass of a body measured in grams, the length of an object measured in centimeters, and so on. Similarly, Astronomers also measure different quantities during astronomy observations, which can be used to understand the physical properties of that astronomical object. In astronomy, measurements are done in some well-defined units, like any other area of physics. One such important quantity in astronomy is the flux density, which defines the amount of energy received per unit of time from astronomical sources if collected over a unit area and unit solid angle for a monochromatic emission. At radio wavelengths, the unit of this flux density is Jansky (Jy), named after the pioneer of radioastronomy, Karl. J. Jansky. When an astronomer observes the radio emission from a celestial object using a radio telescope, the tiny amount of incident radio emission is converted into electronic voltages by the very sensitive electronic instruments of the radio telescope. The corresponding power generated by these very tiny voltages is recorded in some arbitrary units. But, to understand the physical processes happening on that celestial object, astronomers need to convert this measured power into the units of Jy. The process to convert this is known as flux density calibration. Precise measurement of the flux density in units of Jy is essential to properly measure other physical properties, like distance, size, temperature, and so on, of that astronomical source. This process is routinely done using a bright radio source with a well-pre-defined flux density. These are called calibrator sources. While observing the Sun at radio wavelengths, this standard approach does not work. The flux density of the Sun is about 1000 times more than the brightest celestial radio source in the sky. Like at the optical wavelengths, it is tough to observe the background sources in the sky at radio wavelengths when the Sun is in the sky. Hence, to obtain the flux density of the Sun at radio wavelengths, solar physicists have used different laboratory measurements of the properties of the instrument to estimate the flux density of solar radio emission. But those estimations had comparatively large errors in the flux density. Observing Stars in the Day  Fig. 1 : An image of the daytime sky at radio frequency (80 MHz). The image is made from the observations taken with the instrument called the Murchison Widefield Array, which can observe a large, about 2500 square degrees of the sky at a time. The red circle in the image marks the Sun. All small white dots in the image are background sourcesemitting radio frequencies, including stars, galaxies, quasars, pulsars, and others. For precise flux density calibration of solar observation, several background radio sources with well-known flux densities must be observed during the daytime. This is extremely challenging. Despite great challenges, a team of solar physicists from NCRA, led by Devojyoti Kansabanik, have successfully observed more than 80 background radio sources with the Sun in the field of view (FOV) of the telescope using images having a dynamic range of 1000. The dynamic range is the ratio between the brightest and faintest emission detected in the image. They used one of the most advanced telescopes in the world, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), situated in the western Australian desert, to make this high dynamic range image. This image is shown in Figure 1. A red circle marks the Sun, and all other small white dots are the radio emissions from background stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies. They detected more than 80 sources with the Sun in the sky. This is the first time such an image of a daytime sky is made, which seems like observing stars in the day. Precise Measurement of Flux Density of the Radio SunKansabanik et al. use these background radio sources to estimate the flux density of the radio Sun. The known flux density of these sources is obtained from the GLEAM survey and determines a scalar number for each source to match their flux density obtained from the image with the previously known values. They have found that these scalar numbers are constant for the full image. Hence, the same scalar number can be used to obtain the true flux density of the Sun in units of Jy. This method allows them to measure solar flux density with a precision of 10 %, which is about 3 to 6 times more precise than the previous method developed by Oberoi et al. 2017. They also found that the 10% error is mostly coming from the error on the known flux densities from GLEAM of these radio sources. Kansabanik et al. also devise a method exploiting the extreme stability of the MWA. They demonstrated that a very precise solar flux density could be obtained only using an analytical function of frequency without using any dedicated observation of flux density calibrator. Importance for Future Observations of the Sun and HeliosphereAs said earlier, astronomers use precise flux density measurements to estimate several physical parameters of the celestial source. The radio emission from quiet solar corona or coronal mass ejections can be used to measure those media’s temperature, magnetic field, and electron properties. The estimated values of these plasma parameters strongly depend on the precision of the flux density measurements. Besides achieving precise flux density measurement, the first-ever successful detection of a large number of faint background radio sources makes it possible to observe the heliosphere close to the Sun using a wide FOV instrument, which is otherwise impossible. These sources and their polarized emission can be used in the future to measure the magnetic field in interplanetary space. When a large amount of plasma is erupted from theSun in the form of a CME and crosses the background sources, its polarization properties get changed by the magnetic field of the CME plasma. A similar phenomenon can be observed when magnetized solar wind passes through the line of sight of these background sources. The changes in polarization properties of them can be an efficient method to measure the magnetic field in the heliosphere over a larger region, which is rather challenging and only limited to some vantage point measurements directly from a handful of spacecraft. Work is currently underway to use the polarization properties of these sources to achieve this objective. References: Oberoi, D. , Sharma, R. &amp; Rogers, A. E. E.

    "body": "2022/12/16 -  A popular article describing the history and contributions of the Vainu Bappu Observatory: the telescope town of India. My affair with the observatory is also highlighted in brief.  IntroductionDevelopment of astronomy in ancient civilizations like during the times of Babylonians, Greeks, Egyptians, etc. took place due to some fundamental needs. Some of these needs were predicting seasons precisely which helped the ancient people in agriculture, using the night sky for proper navigation while travelling in uncharted areas without having any compass or clock, fixing the time for religious rites, etc. The earliest recorded astronomical observations date back to around 1600 BCE by Babylonians, much before the beginning of the Christian era. As time progressed, advancement in astronomy took place gradually. And in parallel to this, an overall progress in science and technology also occurred. History shows that studying astronomy has generated fundamental knowledge which has benefited every human being through ages. For example, the discovery of gravitation by Newton led to the understanding of planetary motion, which further laid the foundation of space technology – a boon of science which has benefited almost every human being. STD phone, mobile, internet, etc. are some of the results of the development of space technology. However, invention of telescope and then studying the sky with bigger and better telescopes stationed in different astronomical observatories has greatly helped in this progress of astronomy since the past few hundred years. Encyclopedia Britannica defines an ‘astronomical observatory’ as “any structure containing telescopes and auxiliary instruments with which to observe celestial objects”. Like different other countries, India also possesses a long tradition of astronomy since ancient times [1]. Standing in the present day twenty-first century, India possesses several world-class research institutes and observatories carrying high-class researches in astronomy. One such important astronomical observatory situated in Indian soil is the Vainu Bappu Observatory, a place which one can truly be considered as the ‘Telescope City of India’. Vainu Bappu Observatory (VBO): Telescope city of IndiaAround 200 km south-west of Chennai and 175 km south-east of Bangalore, in the Tirupathur district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu lies the picturesque Javadi hills. Amidst this forested vegetation, near the neighborhoods of the village known as Kavalur and at an altitude of around 750 m (longitude 78° 49. 6’ E; latitude 12° 34. 6’ N) is located the Vainu Bappu Observatory (VBO) – one of the most important and active astronomical observatories in India and also in Asia. Situated away from light pollution and hustles-bustles of any big city, VBO is operated by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bangalore. Spread over an area of 40-hectare, this place attracts astronomers and researchers from across the country who are involved in studying celestial objects like stars, exoplanets, galaxies, etc. and also engineers, operators and other staff members who look after the proper functioning of the observatory. Apart from these busy and always cheerful people, VBO is filled with a variety of greenery of tropical region besides a number of medicinal plants. This is because the area is inside a protected forest. Monkeys are regular visitors among animals. And occasionally, appearance of some wildlife like deer, snakes and scorpions also greet the people working inside the campus.   Figure 1: Arial view of the Vainu Bappu Observatory located at Kavalur, Tamil Nadu (credit: P. Deshmukh, IIA, Bangalore) However, the location of VBO provides advantages for night sky observation for astronomers. Apart from being reasonably away from city lights and industrial areas, this particular location was chosen in order to be closer to the Earth’s equator. Thus, coverage of both northern and southern hemispheres with equal ease becomes possible. Moreover, the longitudinal position of VBO is such that it is the only major astronomical facility between Australia and South Africa for observing the southern celestial objects [2]. Establishment of VBOVBO traces its root far back in history. I shall discuss here in brief about how it was established. The first astronomical observatory in India was established at Madras (now Chennai) in 1786 by the East India Company “for promoting the knowledge of astronomy, geography and navigation in India. ” It became the premier institute in India for works on the fundamental positions of stars during the 19th century.  A catalogue of 11, 015 southern hemisphere stars was produced by the Madras observatory in 1843 under the guidance of T. G. Taylor, the then Director of the observatory. This is the famous Madras Catalogue. Research in planetary science and stellar astronomy at the Madras Observatory reached its peak during the latter half of the 19th century, under the leadership of Norman Pogson, the Director of the observatory during 1861-1891. With his Indian assistants Pogson measured accurately the positions of around 50, 000 stars, discovered six variable stars and six asteroids during this period. In 1867, an Indian astronomer, Chintamani Ragoonathacharry (1838-1932), an assistant of Pogon, discovered a variable star– R Reticuli. This is probably the first recorded astronomical discovery by an Indian in the era of telescopes.  Then, during the Total Solar Eclipse on August 18, 1868, the first spectroscopes were used to observe an eclipse event. So this eclipse became an important landmark which signaled the birth of solar physics in India. After Pogson’s death (June 23, 1891), initiatives were taken to establish a separate solar physics observatory. Following the decision, Kodaikanal Solar Observatory was established at Kodaikanal, Tamilnadu within few years. It started working officially on April 1, 1899. However, due to the climate it was understood that Kodaikanal can provide very few nights available for observation. In 1945, the Government of India appointed a committee, chaired by the eminent physicist Meghnad Saha which started planning the post-war development of astronomy in India. Manali Kallat Vainu Bappu, a great visionary who took over as the director of the Kodaikanal Observatory in 1960 knew that Kodaikanal is not a suitable place for stellar research. However, establishing an observatory for stellar studies and optical astronomy was the dream of M. K. Vainu Bappu. So he led a search since 1962 for finding a suitable site in southern India for establishing an optical observatory. He succeeded in finding a sleepy little hamlet i. e. Kavalur in the Javadi Hills as a suitable site for establishing optical telescopes for observing celestial objects. Observations began in 1968 with a 38 cm telescope made in the backyard of the Kodaikanal Observatory [3]. Then in 1971, a fully autonomous research institute was formed under complete funding from the Government of India, which came to be known as the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) [4]. Located in Bangalore, IIA took over the VBO facility henceforth. Facilities at VBO [2, 5, 6]Presently, VBO boosts of a number of sophisticated telescopes and asoociated instruments for looking at the heavens. The historical 1-m Carl Zeiss reflecting telescope, the 2. 34-m Vainu Bappu Telescope, the recently installed 1. 3-m J. C. Bhattacharya Telescope forms the major facilities. The first telescope was of 38 cm (15-inch) aperture, with which astronomical observations were started in 1968 at VBO. Later, a 75 cm (30-inch) telescope was completely designed and fabricated at the workshops of the IIA. It is still used for observations at VBO. Another 45-cm aperture joined the arsenal within few years. In recent years, one more telescope, known as the ‘DIMM Telescope’ also stands tall in the campus.   Figure 2: The DIMM Telescope at the VBO site (credit) Then in 1972, a 1. 02-m (primary mirror diameter) class reflecting telescope made by Carl Zeiss Jena was installed at VBO. Having the Ritchey-Chretien F/13 optical configuration, this remained as one of the primary facility for observing celestial objects for over a decade. It is working fully till now and is attached with two instruments for observations, a stellar optical polarimeter and the Universal Astronomical Grating Spectrograph (UAGS). Anyone of them can be used at a time attaching with the telescope.

Completely designed and built in India, this telescope project was started by Vainu Bappu. However, he passed away in 1982 and could not see the successful installation and working of this dream telescope. On January 6, 1986, the observatory was renamed as the Vainu Bappu Observatory and the 2. 3-m telescope as ‘Vainu Bappu Telescope’ (VBT) [6]. It remained as the largest telescope in Asia until a 3. 6-meter telescope was set up at Devasthal, near Nainital, by ARIES. It is majorly used for deep sky observations including stars and galaxies currently using two instruments at prime focus. It is operated as a national facility and attracts proposals from all over the country and occasionally from abroad.

Bhattacharya Telescope, popularly known as the JCBT. It was installed in April 2014 and was named after the ex-Director of VBO, Dr. Jagadish Chandra Bhattacharya. Possessing a Ritchey-Chretien F/8 optical configuration, JCBT has three instrument ports. The main port consists a 2k x 4k CCD system for direct imaging purpose.   Figure 5: The 1. 3-m JCBT at the VBO campus (credit: https://www. iiap. res. in/vbo. htm) Major discoveries and research highlightsContributions of VBO in astronomy are immense. This included some major discoveries which are discussed below:  The 1-m telescope started producing fruitful results just within few months after it began operation in January, 1972. In June, 1972, it discovered the presence of a thin atmosphere around Ganymede, the largest satellite of Jupiter [7].  In March, 1977, rings of Uranus were discovered by J. C. Bhattacharya (Director of VBO after M. K. Vainu Bappu) and his colleagues while observing through the same telescope [8].  Figure 6: News on confirmation of the rings of Uranus published in Deccan Herald newspaper on April 28, 1981 (credit:http://prints. iiap. res. in/bitstream/handle/2248/1059/E7. 2. pdf;jsessionid=F7FDBA92400FD589617ED58C49E0ED30?sequence=1)  Then in 1984, the discovery of a thin outer ring around Saturn was reported by VBO using the same telescope [9].  Another important discovery was made using the 45 cm Schmidt telescope. On February 17, 1988, a new minor planet was discovered by a team of six astronomers led by R. Rajamohan [10]. It was a part of a special search program for asteroids called ‘Project Kalki’. Later, this asteroid was named ‘4130 Ramanujan’ after the legendary Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. This became the first discovery of an asteroid from the Indian soil in the 20th century.  Figure 7: Discovery of the asteroid Ramanujan published in Current Science journal in 1989 (credit:http://prints. iiap. res. in/bitstream/handle/2248/3975/Discovery%20of%20asteroid%20number%204130?sequence=3&amp;isAllowed=y) Another notable work performed from VBO was to survey the stars of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) galaxy using ultraflow dispersion spectroscopy. Moreover, astronomers of IIA started observing the famous supernova of 1987, i. e. SN1987A in LMC within 48 hours of the discovery. Observing this supernova in details using both 1-m and the 75 cm telescopes, despite its low elevation in the southern sky, proved the importance of the geographic location of Kavalur. Apart from these major achievements, front-line research is carried out at VBO in present days also, using different focal plane instrument facilities. Research at VBO focuses in observing and studying most of the areas of optical astronomy viz. solar system objects, stars, star clusters, galaxies, stellar explosions, blazars, optical imaging of gamma-ray burst fields, etc. Communication facilities via the VSAT satellite connection are available for every user for the telescopes. VBO and me: a personal accountA large number of Indian observational astronomers owe a lot to VBO. Many of the major projects leading to PhD by observational Indian astronomers have been carried out using data obtained from the VBT, or at least any one telescope facility from VBO. I am also one among those numerous researchers. My official tie-up with VBO started since October, 2017. Being an MPhil scholar of astrophysics at the CHRIST (Deemed to be University), I started observing a carefully selected sample of classical Be (Be hereafter) stars using the historical 1-m telescope at VBO. It was a study where I, my supervisor and co-supervisor collaborated with IIA. Continuous monitoring of these stars was necessary for few years to study the disc formation and dissipation timescales in Be stars. I fell in love with the serene beauty, wonderful co-operative staff members of the campus from the very first days. And then started a never forgettable journey of my life. The same project became a part of my PhD thesis which I led as the Principal Investigator since February 2019. Since 2017, we received over 150 nights of observation to obtain the spectra for our selected stars. A total of 61 nights I myself have stayed at VBO doing the observations, which would have definitely increased if COVID19 did not hit the world. I can truly say that these 61 nights of my life were among the best ones I have experienced. It was during my stay at Kavalur I was able to work for over 12 hours a day, in a calm and quiet place without any man-made disturbances. This was the place where I was able to complete a major portion of my analysis works related to MPhil.   Figure 8: The 1-m telescope visible from the balcony of VBT at Kavalur observatory (credit: author) Whole night of observations was a routine schedule when the only sound was originated from the chirpings of monkeys, and the murmurs of insects mixed with an un-describable drizzling sound of leaves of trees due to mild breeze. Morning arrived with excellent views of sunrise and amazing roars of innumerable birds. The days passed by mostly sleeping and taking care of my belongings from the anytime invaders – the monkeys. Occasional appearance of scorpions and snakes was also not something unusual.   Figure 9: Morning arrives after a night’s observations using the 1-m telescope. The moon is still visible in the sky(credit: author) However, the most beautiful periods of spending at VBO, I presume, is during the summers, especially April. Apart from clear skies, almost the entire campus becomes colorful with the arrival of flowers in the treetops. For me, working in such an environment was like a childhood dream come true, a dream which turned to love and then into passion ultimately setting my aim – to become an observational astronomer studying the stars. I do cherish these wonderful days spent in the midst of telescopes, jungles, warm people and serene nature while working for my MPhil and then PhD. As an astronomer in near future, I would definitely love to maintain my attachment with VBO, forever.   Figure 10: A colorful view of the VBO campus during summer time. VBT is visible from the balcony of the 1-m telescope (credit: author) ConclusionWith the rapid development of technology, presently we are actually standing in a golden era of astronomy. Apart from the VBO, India currently possesses several world-class research institutes and observatories carrying high-classresearches in astronomy. One such observatory is the Indian astronomical Observatory (IAO) located in the remote village of Hanle, Ladakh in the Jammu &amp; Kashmir district. Situated at a height of 4, 517 meters from the sea level, this place was found to be a world-class astronomical site for establishing a large optical telescope. IAO was started in 2001 and contains the 2-m (200-cm) aperture Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), which was dedicated to the nation in August 2001. Like the VBO, IAO is also operated by IIA, Bangalore. The HCT facility can be operated from a remote control centre at Hoskote, around 35 km from Bangalore, making it one of the most powerful remote controlled telescope facility of the world. The HCT is being used to study several types of celestial objects and phenomenon including stellar spectroscopy, galactic and extra-galactic star forming regions, young stellar objects, star clusters, supernova, gamma-ray bursts, etc. During the past decade, different other facilities such as the 0. 7-m wide field robotic telescope (under the GROWTH project), Himalayan Gamma Ray Array (HAGAR), imaging Cherenkov telescope (MACE) have come up due to the infrastructure developed by IIA at the IAO site. The site is also being characterized for another 10-m class telescope which is a future project. Participation in international projects was also envisaged in the Astronomy and Astrophysics “Decadal Vision Document 2004” sponsored by the Indian Academy of Sciences and the Astronomical Society of India. Development and successful operation of ASTROSAT - India’s first astronomy satellite was a major achievement in the past decade. Moreover, India is now playing an active role in participating in different future world class megaprojects related to astronomy. India-TMT, LIGO-India, SKA (Square Kilometer Array) are some such highly ambitious projects, whereas Aditya L1, NLST, INSIST, Gaganyaan are some of the future space missions to study various objects and phenomenon of the universe. Plans to send future missions to the Moon and Mars are also under consideration. Hence, one can understand that India’s future in astronomy seems truly promising. Now, it is up to the intellect of motivated young Indians whether we will be able to exploit these facilities fully and hence, will be able to carry forward the astronomy tradition of India or not.

    "title": "What makes radio-quiet AGN radio-quiet? A polarization perspective",
    "body": "2022/12/11 -  There is a lack of consensus on the origin of radio emission in radio-quiet (RQ) and radio-intermediate (RI) AGN. Primary contenders include low-power radio jets, winds, star-formation and coronal emission. Our multi-frequency, multi-scale radio polarization study has revealed a multi-component (jet + ‘wind’), stratified radio outflow in the two intermediate AGN, III Zw 2 and Mrk 231. Each strata of the outflow has a characteristic magnetic field geometry. Our radio polarization study in conjunction with the [O III] emission-line study of five RQ quasars have provided insights into the interplay of jets, winds and emission-line gas. A close interaction between the different emission components themselves as well as with the local host environments is likely responsible for the stunted nature of the radio outflows in RQ and RI AGN. Our findings are also consistent with the idea that radio-loudness of a source is a function of its epoch of observation.  IntroductionActive Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic and extremely luminous phenomena in the Universe. They emit radiation at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. This radiation which is of non-stellar origin is believed to originate from supermassive black holes (BHs; 106 − 109 M⊙, the mass of the sun; see review by Rees, 1984) as matter accretes onto them through an accretion disk. The different constituents of an AGN, some of which have been inferred indirectly from multi-wavelength continuum and spectroscopic observations, include (see Figure 1):  a BH at the centre of the host galaxy, an accretion disk, a hot magnetized corona presumably located above the accretion disk, high velocity and dense gas clouds (known as the broad line region or BLR) which give rise to the broad emission lines in the optical spectra, low velocity and relatively less dense gas clouds (known as the narrow line region or NLR) which give rise to the narrow emission lines in the optical spectra, an obscuring torus of gas and dust that hides the BLR clouds from sight for certain viewing angles (Peterson, 1997; Urry &amp; Padovani, 1995).  Figure 1: The standard model of AGN from Urry &amp; Padovani, 1995 A small fraction (10−20%) of AGN also launch relativistic, powerful and collimated structures called jets at radio frequencies (Kellermann et al. , 1989; Urry, 2003). These jets are launched perpendicular to the BH-accretion disk interface and extend over scales ranging from a few hundred kiloparsecs (kpc) to several megaparsecs (Mpc). This class of AGN is called the radio-loud (RL) AGN. On the other hand, the majority of AGN (80−90%) launch weak and small-scale radio jets that typically extend to less than 10 kpc. Alternatively, they may also host broadly collimated wind-like or diffuse radio outflows. These constitute the radio-quiet (RQ) class of AGN. The division between RL and RQ AGN is mathematically shown in terms of the radio-loudness parameter (R) given by Kellermann et al. (1989), which is the ratio of radio flux density at 5 GHz to optical flux density in the B-band. According to this definition, RL AGN has R &gt; 10 while RQ AGN has R ≤ 10. Falcke et al. (1996) proposed another class of AGN with intermediate R values (10 &lt; R &lt; 250), known as the radio-intermediate (RI) AGN. Key conceptsThe two widely discussed mechanisms for jet production in the literature include: Blandford &amp; Znajek (1977) mechanism, hereafter referred to as BZ77 and Blandford &amp; Payne (1982) mechanism, hereafter referred to as BP82. In BZ77, the jets are produced by electromagnetic extraction of energy and angular momentum from a spinning BH, while in BP82, the energy and angular momentum are magnetically extracted from the accretion disk. The origin of radio emission in RL AGN is often attributed to the BZ77 mechanism while the origin of radio emission in RQ and RI AGN is poorly understood. It is not clear if their emission mechanism is that of BZ77 or BP82 or both. The possible scenarios for radio emission in RQ AGN as proposed in the literature include low-power jets, winds, star-formation, coronal emission, and a combination of them (e. g. , Panessa et al. , 2019). Some of the open questions on jet physics that we are trying to address include:  Where are the jets launched from? What causes the collimation of jets? What are the jets composed of? Why are the jets in RQ and RI AGN stunted or small-scale as opposed to the large-scale jets in RL AGN?Radio emission from the jets is basically the synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic electrons spiraling around the magnetic (B) field lines. Synchrotron emission from an individual electron is highly confined to a narrow cone pointing towards the direction of the electron motion (a process known as “beaming”), and radiation from an ensemble of relativistic electrons is intrinsically linearly polarized. Radio polarization observations can provide information about the orderliness and orientation of the B field giving rise to the synchrotron emission. According to the synchrotron theory, the inferred B fields are parallel to the electric polarization vectors for optically thick regions like the core while perpendicular, in the case of optically thin regions like the jets, lobes and hotspots. ResultsTowards briefly addressing the key questions listed above, we carried out a multi- frequency, multi-scale radio polarization study of the RI Palomar Green quasar, III Zw 2 (Silpa et al. , 2021a) as well as of a quasar that is currently transitioning from the RQ to RL state, viz. , Mrk 231 (Silpa et al. , 2021b) with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and the Very Large Array (VLA). We find a stratified radio outflow in these sources, which could either be:  a “spine-sheath” structure in the radio jet, where the ‘spine’ refers to a narrow relativistic jet component and the ‘sheath’ refers to a broader sub-relativistic jet component, enclosing the spine; or a ‘jet + wind’ composite structure, where the ‘wind’ component could either be a magnetized accretion disk wind or the outer layers of a broadened jet (like a jet sheath) or a combination of both. We find that each component of the stratified outflow has a characteristic B field geometry. Theoretical models emphasize on the importance of helical B fields (which comprise of poloidal and toroidal field components) for the production and propagation of jets. From our study we find that the inferred B fields are parallel to the local direction of the radio outflow in case of the jet spine/jet component while they are transverse in the case of the jet sheath/wind component (see Figure 4). The parallel inferred B fields represent the poloidal component of the helical field while the transverse inferred B fields represent the toroidal component (e. g. , see Figure 2).   Figure 2: Magnetic field lines of toroidal (left) and poloidal (right) components from Herbrik &amp; Kokkotas (2017). With the uGMRT, we also detect a kpc-scale radio lobe to the south in III Zw 2 (annotated as ML in Figure 3) that is misaligned with the primary lobes (annotated as NEL and SWL in Figure 3). Based on the two-frequency spectral index image and electron lifetimes estimated using the “equipartition” equations (O’Dea &amp; Owen, 1987), we find that the misaligned lobe emission does not arise from any past activity of AGN. Rather it is being actively fed by the nucleus through intermittent fueling, similar to the large and ‘alive’ radio lobes observed in the radio galaxy M87 at 330 MHz with the VLA (Owen et al. , 2000). The lobe characteristics, such as a mean spectral index between −0. 6 and −0. 7 and a lack of clear spectral steepening with distance from the core, are also similar to those of the ‘sputtering’ AGN, NGC 3998 (Sridhar et al. , 2020), suggesting that the AGN in III Zw 2 is similarly ‘sputtering’. We also note that the curved VLA jet in III Zw 2 terminates in ‘bow-shock-like’ radio structures on either side, instead of compact hotspots typically seen in Fanaroff–Riley Class II radio galaxies. A similar feature is seen in the restarted jet simulations of Clarke &amp; Burns (1991), suggesting the presence of restarted jet activity in III Zw 2, possibly on very short time scales, ranging in decades.   Figure 3: The uGMRT 685 MHz total intensity contours in green with inferred B- fields as red ticks and EVLA 5 GHz B-array contours in blue with inferred B-fields as black ticks, for III Zw 2 (Silpa et al. , 2021a). The length of these vectors is proportional to polarized intensity and the orientation of the vectors is determined by the polarization angle. The regions with longer ticks are highly polarized regions while the regions with shorter ticks are less polarized regions. NEL refers to the north-eastern lobe, SWL refers to the south-western lobe and ML refers to the misaligned lobe in III Zw 2. As already mentioned, RQ and RI AGN are known to be powered by multiple radio emission processes. It is a good exercise to estimate the relative contributions of the individual processes towards the overall budget of the radio emission. This exercise can be carried out for sources that have multi-scale, multi-frequency radio data since different emission components will be sampled at different resolutions and frequencies. We carried out a similar study for Mrk 231, and we have been able to obtain first-order estimates of the relative contributions from the weakly collimated jet, AGN-driven wind, and starburst-driven wind to the total radio emission observed. Our results suggest that while the starburst-driven wind accounts for ∼ 10−20% of the total radio emission, both AGN wind and the weakly collimated jet contribute significantly to the rest of the emission in Mrk 231. As the radiation propagates through the magneto-ionic medium (i. e. composed of free charges and B fields) between the source and the observer, the two orthogonal components of the electromagnetic wave interact differently with the local free charges. This results in different refractive indices and speeds of propagation for the two components, which in turn induces a delay between them that shows up as a rotation of the plane of polarization. This phenomenon is called Faraday rotation. Owing to the effect of Faraday rotation, the intrinsic polarization angle differs from its observed value by an amount that depends on the square of wavelength. The constant of proportionality is called rotation measure (RM), which physically depends on the line-of-sight component of the B field, and the electron number density and path length of the Faraday-rotating medium. Based on the 3-frequency RM images of Mrk 231, we find that the radio outflow in this source becomes increasingly matter-dominated away from the core, suggesting that the synchrotron plasma mixes with the entrained gas as the radio outflow (jet/lobe and/or wind) propagates through the ambient medium. Thus, the role of the local environments is important to consider while studying AGN outflows. In a study carried out on a small sample of RQ quasars with the radio polarization data from the VLA and the [O III] emission-line imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we find that the polarized radio emission is more often spatially anti-correlated with [O III] emission (Silpa et al. , 2022). A similar anti-correlation has been observed in RL AGN in the literature (e. g. , van Breugel et al. , 1984) where it has been suggested that the radio emission is depolarized by the emission-line gas. We find evidence for mixing of the entrained thermal gas with the synchrotron plasma in the lobes of these sources, which could be resulting in the internal depolarization of the lobe emission. The anti-correlation between polarization and emission-line gas could be interpreted as a signature of the jet/wind-gas interaction and possibly a source of AGN feedback in these sources. AGN feedback is a process by which the energy and matter are transported from the central engine to the interstellar medium of the host galaxy via AGN outflows like jets and winds, with an effect of either heating and/or expelling the star-forming material or enhancing local star- formation (e. g. , Alexander &amp; Hickox, 2012; Fabian, 2012; Morganti, 2017; Harrison et al. , 2018). DiscussionOverall, a close interaction between the multiple components of the radio outflow (jet and wind) and the surrounding gaseous environment may be producing stunted jets in RQ and RI AGN. Drawing analogies from X-ray binaries, we propose a model in Figure 4 that demonstrates a possible connection between the spectral state changes (hard/soft) of the accretion disk and the nature of radio outflows in different radio classes of AGN. In this model, the outer regions of the accretion disk are in soft spectral state, and are characterized by the thermal emission from the Shakura &amp; Sunyaev (1973) disk, which is an optically thick and a geometrically thin disk. The magnetic flux accumulation close to the BH is not efficient enough for the launching of powerful radio jets in case of the thin accretion disk. Therefore, this state produces suppressed radio jets, and strong winds that could either be driven by the BP82 mechanism or could be a jet sheath (see Figure 4). On the other hand, the inner regions of the accretion disk are in hard spectral state, and are characterized by an advection-dominated accretion flow (Narayan &amp; Yi, 1994), where the energy, instead of being radiated away, is advected into the BH during accretion. This state facilitates the accumulation of magnetic flux close to the BH, and therefore produces a powerful and steady radio jet or the jet spine, driven by the BZ77 mechanism (see Figure 4). Such a co-axial outflow would appear co-spatial in projection, as seen in our sources. It is very likely that the different emission layers like the jet spine/jet and the jet sheath/wind interact with each other (this refers to the region between BZ77- and BP82-driven components in Figure 4). Consequently, this may either disrupt the jet, or most of the mass and energy may be carried away by the wind rather than the jet. This could result in low-powered, small-scaled jets seen in RQ and RI AGN, as opposed to the large-scaled, powerful jets in the RL AGN.   Figure 4: A cartoon to illustrate a possible connection between the changing spectral states of the accretion disk and the multi-component radio outflow in AGN, as inferred from our work on RQ and RI AGN (Silpa et al. , 2021a). The white ticks denote the B-field vectors. Typically, the transition between the hard and soft spectral states in regular RL and RQ AGN occurs on time scales of 106 − 108 yr (Alexander &amp; Leahy, 1987; Enßlin &amp; Gopal- Krishna, 2001; Shabala et al. , 2008). However, this may occur on much shorter time scales, like decades, in intermittent/sputtering AGN sources. Such rapid transitions may explain the co-existence of a jet of moderate radio luminosity with an accretion disk wind in such sources. Furthermore, this model is in support of the idea that radio-loudness is a function of the epoch at which the source is observed (e. g. , Nipoti et al. , 2005; Kunert-Bajraszewska et al. , 2020; Nyland et al. , 2020). This could imply that the RQ AGN are the sources which are in soft state, launching strong winds and suppressed jets, and RL AGN are the sources which are in hard state, launching powerful jets, at the time of their observations. ConclusionsThe key takeaways from this article are:  RQ and RI AGN are likely powered by multi-component radio outflows (jet + ‘wind’). Signatures of possible outflow stratification emerge from the different inferred magnetic field structures in the polarization observations.  A close interaction between the different emission components themselves as well as with the local host environments may be the reason for the stunted nature of the radio outflows in RQ and RI AGN. The radio-loudness of a source may be a function of its epoch of observation.

    "title": "Gravitational Waves in an Inhomogeneous Universe",
    "body": "2022/12/08 -  Space is quite inhomogeneous at small scales. These inhomogeneities may play a significant role in governing the physical phenomena at this scale. Here we have analysed the impact of these inhomogeneities on the Gravitational Wave (GW) observables. For this analysis we have made use of a toy model of the inhomogeneous spacetime. Our analysis shows that the amplitude of GW gets affected by these inhomogeneities and this effect is governed by our model parameters.  IntroductionThe Cosmological Principle states that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic at large scales. Various surveys like Sloan Digital Sky Survey have revealed deviations from homogeneity on samples as large as 500 h-1 Mpc. In comparison, Milky Way galaxy is about 30 kpc across. These inhomogeneities play an important role in governing the physical phenomena at this scale. The physical phenomena that we have considered here is the propagation of Gravitational Waves (GWs). GWs have been a fascinating feature of Physics ever since Einsteinpredicted their existence. GWs are ripples in spacetimeproduced when the acceleration of the second mass moment of the associated motion of a system of masses is non-vanishing. This is valid provided higher order moments are neglected. In TT (transverse traceless) gauge this second mass moment is given by the quadrupole moment. These waves move outwards from their source. Before reaching the observer these waves propagate through the spacetime. In this work, we have analysed how the amplitude of these GWs gets affected by the inhomogeneities present in spacetime. Formalism To study an inhomogeneous spacetime, a suitable averaging procedure is required. In this work, we have used Buchert’s averaging procedureproposed by Thomas Buchert. Buchert’s approach was to first decompose Einstein’s equation into a set of dynamical equations for scalar quantities using Raychaudhuri equation and then average those scalar quantities. Raychaudhuri equation is concerned with the kinematics of flow. Using Einstein’s equation and Raychaudhuri equation ensures that the procedure is GR compliant. For our analysis we have used a toy modelbased on Buchert’s averaging procedure. This toy model presents a simplified picture of the inhomogeneous spacetime where a domain of space has been divided into two types of regions - one overdense region and one underdense region. Here, overdense region is a closed, dust only Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker(FLRW) region while the underdense region is an empty FLRW region. The physical interpretation of this toy model is that the domain of space of our toy model represents the spacetime through which GW is propagating. The overdense region is the matter filled region that the GW encounters in its path while the underdense region is the region of cosmic void. There are two parameters governing our model; fu,the volume fraction of the underdense region and β, the factor governing the time evolution of the scale factor for the underdense region. For the overdense region, there is also fo, the volume fraction of the overdense region, which is related to fu by the relation: fu + fo = 1. These parameters completely determine our toy model. The intervening region between source and observer through which GWs propagate can have any combination of this (fo,fu). Therefore we have used different combinations of (fo,fu) for our analysis. Using Buchert’s averaging procedure and this toy model, we can calculate various averaged scalar quantities for the domain under analysis, like averaged density, averaged Hubble parameter, etc. Our toy model is a theoretical model. In order to check the validity of our analysis, we need to relate the quantities calculated using our toy model with observational quantities. This is where Covariant Schemecomes to our rescue. It relates the theoretically calculated quantities from our toy model, averaged density of the domain and averaged Hubble parameter of the domain, with angular diameter distance DA, an observational quantity. Results   MathJax example   The redshift-dependent part of GW amplitude is given by, \[A = {(1+z)^{5/3} \over D_L},\]  where z is the redshift factor and \(D_L\) is the luminosity distance which is related to angular diameter distance by the relation,  \(D_L = (1+z)^2 D_A. \)  We have plotted this quantity A for different combinations of our model parameter in Figure 1 &amp; Figure 2 and we have related these plots with the homogeneous ΛCDM plot as well. Figure 1 shows that for a certain combination of our model parameters, the plot for our inhomogeneous toy model is very close to the plot of homogeneous ΛCDM model. As we vary our model parameters from this particular combination, the plot for our toy model starts deviating from the plot of the ΛCDM model and this deviation increases as we vary our model parameters more and more from that particular combination.

For all other combinations of (fo,fu) and β, there is substantial deviation from the homogeneous ΛCDM case. This shows that inhomogeneities in spacetime play an important role in the propagation of GWs and therefore should not be ignored. ConclusionsOur study shows that the inhomogeneities present in the spacetime have substantial effect on the observables of GWs traversing through this spacetime. Our present analysis should inspire further studies of the effect of inhomogeneous spacetime on various other physical phenomena.

    "title": "Insight into the pulsar emmision mechanism using subpulse drifting: Subpulse drifting in PSR J1822−2256",
    "body": "2022/10/31 -  Long after humans figured out that the small bright dots in the night sky were just another sun-like object, and not very long after the discovery of the neutron, in the year 1933, Baade and Zwicky theorized the existence of a star made entirely of neutrons. It was called a neutron star and was thought to be leftover after the death of a rather massive star. The theory was, however, left alone due to the lack of proof.  In 1967, a graduate student found something strange in her data. She saw a signal coming from the sky at equal intervals in time with impeccable accuracy, unknown, until then, to any known astrophysical source. Naturally, this sparked an interest in not just the entire scientific community but also among the non-scientific folks. The phenomenon was initially ascribed to alien civilizations due to the lack of scientific reason. Within a year, the era’s greatest minds figured that the 1967 discovery was, in fact, related to the theory conjectured in 1933. The neutron star spins at incredibly high rotational velocity owing to the conservation of angular momentum. They also emit radiation from their magnetic poles, observed at a wide range of wavelengths from Gamma-ray to Radio. This combination of emission from poles and rotation caused the apparent pulsating nature of the signal as seen by a steady observer on Earth. These ‘pulsating’ objects are now commonly known as pulsars.   Figure 1: 2D pulse stacks displaying the subpulse drifting modes of emission observed for J1822−2256. The modes A, B, C, and D are arranged anticlockwise. Here, the x-axis shows the pulse phase, whereas the y-axis is the pulse number. The figure clearly shows drift patterns and their distinct behaviour representing the four different drift modes. (Credits: Author) In a recent publication, our team tried to understand some long-standing questions related to pulsar emission, in light of new high-quality data from the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), on the pulsar J1822-2256. This work revolves around a periodic pattern found in some pulsars, different from their rotational periodicity. It has been found that the pulse observed from pulsars is not uniform and often shows sub-structures called subpulses. These subpulses are conjectured to come from small pockets of ‘sparks’. The exact working of these sparks is still unclear. But the idea is that as the pulsar rotates around its rotational axis, these sparks also rotate with a period different from the pulsar’s rotational period. Therefore, after each pulsar rotation, the spark arrangement seen by the observer is different from before. Interestingly, a diagonal pattern can be seen when the pulses are stacked in a 2D pulse stack, as shown in figure 1. This phenomenon is called subpulse drifting and gives a unique insight directly into the pulsar emission process. It is to be noted that pulsars show different kinds of drifting, and the parameters are rarely similar for any two pulsars. The number of pulsar rotations it takes for a subpulse to reappear at any given phase is denoted by the value P3.   Table 1: Drift mode measurements of J1822−2256. (Credits: Author)  Figure 2: Average profiles of different modes of emission of J1822−2256 at band 3 (300–500 MHz) and band 4 (550–750 MHz). The black dashed lines show the average profile, and the rest show the colour-coded average profile for each mode. The profiles are given arbitrary constant shifts along the y-axis for display purposes. Apart from the variation of the profiles across the different modes, the frequency-dependent behaviour of the profiles in each mode can also be observed here. (Credits: Author)  Figure 3: Plot of emission heights for different modes with frequency. The different colours represent the different subpulse drifting modes. (Credits: Author) Our study found that the pulsar J1822-2256 shows at least four types of subpulse drifting modes, listed in table 1. The pulsar also seems to significantly lower or stop its emission aperiodically. The average pulsar emission (seen in an average profile, figure 2) also changes as the pulsar switches from one mode to the other. A direct implication of this finding is that the spark configuration changes as the pulsar changes its drifting modes. Through a robust calculation, we also calculated the possible number of sparks in each subpulse drifting mode. How and why the spark configuration changes are the questions that need to be answered. We further tried to explore the emission region for this pulsar. We estimated the emission heights for each subpulse drifting mode using the radius to frequency mapping model, suggesting that high-frequency emission dominantly comes from lower emission heights and low-frequency emission comes from higher altitudes. According to this new-found-knowledge, we claim that the emission we observe from the pulsar is inversely related to the number of sparks in each drifting mode. Figure 3 shows this inverse relationship between the emission height of different modes and the quantity P3, which is used to characterize the subpulse drifting modes. Therefore, each subpulse mode of emission comes from a different height in the pulsar’s magnetosphere and each mode contains a different number of sparks. Since the discovery of the first pulsar CP1919 by Jocelyn Bell, thousands of pulsars have been observed. Emission from pulsars has been seen at multiple wavelengths; however, not all pulsars emit at all wavelengths. Some pulsars only emit at radio frequencies, while some others only at Gamma-ray frequencies, and a small fraction also emit at multiple wavelengths. However, a majority of the pulsar population shows emission at radio frequencies, sometimes in conjunction with emission at other frequencies as well. These compact objects have been subjects of curiosity for a long time and continue to do so. Neutron stars are highly gravitating objects, only second to black holes. They have magnetic fields over a trillion times stronger than the Earth’s magnetic field. Thus, neutron stars, aka pulsars, are laboratories to study physics in extreme environments, which are otherwise impossible to attain in labs. Despite the pulsars being known for decades, they continue to be mysterious and something that will always gravitate the astronomers.

    "title": "Star-forming S0 Galaxies in SDSS-MaNGA: fading spirals or rejuvenated S0s?",
    "body": "2022/09/30 -  Galaxies are the building blocks of our universe. A comprehensive theory of how galaxies evolve with cosmic time is key to understanding how the universe turns out the way it is today. Decades of observational, theoretical and computational efforts have been devoted to this purpose. Despite this, observations continue throwing challenges that theories of galaxy evolution cannot explain. In this work, we try to address one such challenge.  On the basis of their morphology, i. e. appearance, galaxies can be divided into three classes: ●	The Spirals: Spiral galaxies possess a flat rotating disc with spiral arms. ●	The S0s: S0 galaxies possess a flat rotating disc, but lack spiral arms. Quite often, the side-view of S0s takes the shape of a convex lens, thus in the old days S0s were called Lenticulars. ●	The Ellipticals: Elliptical galaxies, on the other hand, are 3-D ellipsoidal distribution of stars, and do not have any disc-like structure. Typical examples of the three classes are illustrated in Fig. 1 below.      Figure 1: Typical example of a Spiral (top), an S0 (middle) and an Elliptical (bottom) galaxy. (Credits: SDSS, HSC-SSP sky-server) Through galaxy formation theories, we know that Spiral galaxies continuously form new stars. Spiral galaxies contain beautiful spiral arms - the places where new stars are born. On the other hand, S0 and elliptical galaxies are found to have stopped any kind of active star formation. But, it turns out that there exist some S0 galaxies in the nearby universe, which are actively star-forming. In our work, we identify a sample of 120 star-forming S0 galaxies in a large galaxy survey known as the SDSS-MaNGA survey. The images of some of these galaxies is shown in Fig. 2 below.   Figure 2: Very deep HSC-SSP telescope images of some of our star-forming S0 galaxies. (Credits: SDSS, HSC-SSP sky-server) The peculiar nature of these star-forming S0s leads us to quite a few questions. First of all, where does the star-formation happen in these galaxies? The spirals have well defined regions where new stars are born - the spiral arms. No such structure is present in the S0s. In order to answer this question, we will have to probe within these galaxies and find out where new stars are being born. We cannot do this with the conventional spectroscopic and photometric methods, since they give us the light of the entire galaxy as a whole. This does not allow us to resolve the details inside the galaxy. This is where the revolutionary MaNGA survey comes to the rescue! What is so special about the MaNGA survey? One of the most important observables of a galaxy is its spectrum. Spectrum is awesome compared to photometry. Photometry just gives you the total light emitted by the galaxy over a broad range of wavelengths. Whereas, with a spectrum you get the light of the galaxy at every wavelength! That is a lot more information! The spectrum can be used to derive various physical properties of the galaxy, like the Star-Formation Rate (SFR), stellar mass, chemical composition etc. In the past decade, most galaxy surveys were equipped with single-aperture spectroscopy. This means you got the spectrum of the entire galaxy as a whole. However, in recent times, advancement in technology has led to the development of Integral Field Spectrographs (IFS). IFS provides us with the spectrum of various spatial regions of a galaxy in a single observation. Let’s understand this in more detail. The image of a galaxy is divided into numerous spatial regions (similar to pixels in a photographic image). Each such region is called a spaxel (short for spatial-pixel), and we can obtain the spectrum of each spaxel. Because of these spaxels, we get excellent resolution over the 2D image of the galaxy.  With the spectrum of each spaxel, we get the 2D resolved image in each wavelength! Thus, in some sense, IFS provides us with 3D information about the galaxy. The first two axes are the spatial X and Y coordinates, and the third axis is the wavelength. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 below:    Figure 3: Top - MaNGA obtains spatially resolved spectra of a galaxy. The galaxy image is divided into various spatial regions, called spaxels. Each spaxel has a spectrum. This leads to what is called a 3D galaxy data-cube (bottom). The first two axes are the spatial X and Y axis of the galaxy image. We obtain the galaxy image at each wavelength (which is the third axis). (Credits: Dana Berry / SkyWorks Digital Inc. , David Law, and the SDSS collaboration; https://www. sdss. org/surveys/manga/; ESO) The SDSS-MaNGA is one such IFS survey. It enables us to study properties of a galaxy in a spatially resolved manner. Thus, we shall be able to understand the physical processes going on in our star-forming S0 galaxies in great detail. In particular, this will help us probe the interiors of these galaxies and find out where the new stars are being born! We start by studying how the Star-Formation Rate (SFR) of the star-forming S0s varies with the distance from the center of the galaxy. This will give us insights about the site and spatial extent of star-formation in these peculiar galaxies. When we studied the star formation as a function of distance from the galaxy center for the star-forming S0s, we found that they are forming new stars close to their center. This is opposite to what happens in Spiral galaxies, since most of their star-formation happens in the spiral arms present in the disc - i. e. away from the center. This is a very interesting result about the star-forming S0s, which was not known before!Having answered where the star-formation is happening in these star-forming S0s, now we get to the even bigger question - why are they forming new stars (being S0s, they are not supposed to do that!) ? In order to answer this question, we would want to go deeper into the past of these galaxies. A lot of research suggests that S0 galaxies form from Spiral galaxies. When new stars are no longer being born in a Spiral galaxy, the spiral arms slowly start to fade - and eventually disappear. This leads to a galaxy which has a disc, but no spiral arms - i. e. an S0. So, the star-forming S0s could be a population of Spiral galaxies whose spiral arms have faded, but some star-formation activity is still going on in the center - i. e. a last burst of star-formation. This is just one hypothesis with regards to the formation of star-forming S0s. Alternatively, the star-forming S0s could be a population of the usual S0s (with no star-formation), whose star-formation has been somehow revived. They could also be something totally out of the box - a galaxy population with a distinct past of its own! The above hypotheses suggest that there can be various possible connections and comparison points between the star-forming S0s, star-forming Spirals and the usual S0s with no star-formation (also known as quenched S0s). To probe these connections, we construct control samples of star-forming spirals and quenched S0s, in addition to our main sample of star-forming S0s. Now, a main property that distinguishes different classes of galaxies is how compact the spatial distribution of their stars is. An excellent way to probe this compactness is through the galaxy size - mass relation. The galaxy size is to be plotted on the Y-axis, and its stellar mass on the X-axis. It is well known that different classes of galaxies nicely separate out in this plot. We construct the size - mass relation for our star-forming S0s, star-forming Spirals and the usual quenched S0s in Fig. 4. This will help us to compare and contrast the three galaxy populations, in lieu of the hypotheses presented before regarding the star-forming S0s.   Figure 4: Galaxy size (Y-axis) v/s galaxy stellar mass (X-axis) for star-forming S0s (SF-S0s), star-forming Spirals (SF-Sps) and quenched S0s (Q-S0s). Solid line denotes the median trend. (Credits: Authors) In the size - mass plane, the star-forming S0s are quite similar to the quenched S0s, and are different from star-forming Spirals. This suggests that the star-forming S0s are not fading spirals, and are likely to be the usual S0s whose star-formation has been somehow revived! This is another very interesting result which was not confirmed before! Now the next natural question is, what caused the revival of star-formation in our star-forming S0s? One way in which this can happen is if another gas-rich galaxy merged with our S0, and brought in the necessary Hydrogen gas required for forming new stars. This other galaxy must be significantly less massive than our S0, so that the merger does not end up completely deforming our S0. Such mergers are called minor mergers. One key signature of whether a galaxy has undergone a recent minor merger is in the motion of its stars and gas. The minor merger will cause some perturbations to the main galaxy, causing the velocity of stars and gas to get disturbed, as opposed to a coherent rotation around the galaxy center. But how do we study the velocities of stars and gas within these galaxies? Again, MaNGA Integral Field Spectroscopy comes to the rescue! Another very useful quantity that can be derived from a spectrum is the velocity of the object along the line of sight, using the principle of Doppler effect (see this link for more details). Using the MaNGA IFS, we obtain the velocities of stars and gas in various regions of our star-forming S0s. We find that more than 50% of our star-forming S0s have disturbed stellar and gas velocities. In a few cases, we even find the stars and gas rotating in opposite directions about the galaxy center (Fig. 6) !    Figure 5: Example of a counter-rotating star-forming S0. Stars (left) and gas (right) rotate in the opposite sense. The gas has likely come from a smaller galaxy that has merged with the main galaxy! (Credits: Authors) Such disturbed and incoherent stellar and gas velocities indicate instabilities triggered by a recent minor merger. This merger could have brought in the necessary gas for reviving the star-formation in the star-forming S0s. Thus, we infer that minor mergers are the most likely cause for the revival of star-formation in our star-forming S0s! To summarize, in this work, we have been able to answer many questions about these mysterious objects called star-forming S0s. We found that the star-forming S0s form new stars primarily in their central regions, which is opposite to what happens in Spiral galaxies. We also inferred that the star-forming S0s are likely the usual S0s (which do not form new stars), in which star-formation activity has been somehow revived. We conclude that minor merger with a gas-rich galaxy has likely caused this revival. Thus, we have made good progress in solving the mystery behind the existence of star-forming S0s! Moreover, in the bigger picture, our work highlights the importance of minor-mergers as a complex ingredient that shapes how galaxies evolve with time! Still, quite a few concerns remain. We have 120 galaxies in this work, and ideally, we would like to have a larger sample to constrain our findings better. Many large IFS surveys are coming up in the future, and we look forward to them. Moreover, the star-forming gas of these star-forming S0s needs to be analyzed in more detail to fully confirm whether it has come from another galaxy. Molecular gas observations from radio telescopes and better resolution IFS observations will be very helpful in this pursuit!

    "title": "The Great Dimming of Betelgeuse: A Stellar Tipping Point?",
    "body": "2022/09/16 -  The Great Dimming of Betelgeuse (alpha Orionis) in late 2019 puzzled astronomers across the globe. The star appeared the faintest in all its modern recorded history. The mystery mounted as it quickly regained brightness in the next few months, and showed interesting patterns of light variations post dimming. Previously, we had investigated the light curve of Betelgeuse from the perspective of nonlinear dynamics and time series analysis (George et al. 2020). We found signatures of a dynamical transition causing a permanent change in the pulsation dynamics of the star. Here, we discuss these results and present further evidence obtained by analysing multiwavelength data from the star, including visible and infrared radiation.  Introduction: It is easy to spot the constellation Orion in the summer night sky—it looks like a hunter or a shepherd with its waist (or belt) characterised by three stars in a straight line. The shoulder of Orion, Betelgeuse, varies in brightness irregularly, so much so that these variations are noticeable to the naked eye! It is therefore classified as a semiregular variable star—an object of fascination since ancient times.   Figure 1: (left) The star Betelgeuse (as seen by the Hubble telescope) and its size in comparison to Earth’s and Jupiter’s orbit. (right) Location of Betelgeuse in the Orion constellation. Source: http://hubblesite. org/newscenter/archive/1996/04/ Credit: Andrea Dupree (Harvard-Smithsonian CfA), Ronald Gilliland (STScI), NASA and ESA. The brightness of astronomical objects is measured in terms of apparent magnitude: a reverse logarithmic scale to measure how bright the object appears from the Earth. The full moon registers at about -12. 9 on this scale while the Sun is at -26. 7. For pulsating variable stars, this quantity changes periodically as the star repeats cycles of expansions and contractions. Some stars pulsate in a simple periodic manner (corresponding to the so-called fundamental frequency) while others show a more complicated pattern with interfering periods (or frequencies). These additional periods (or corresponding frequencies) can be identified using complex analysis of the light curve. Analysis of the light curve of Betelgeuse shows a primary period of ~425 days, a secondary period of ~5. 9 years and a possible tertiary period of ~180 days. Following these periodicities, its visible brightness can usually go as high as 0. 0 and as low as 1. 3 in apparent magnitude. At 9 million years old, it is expected to go supernova in the next 100,000 years, and when it does, it will be a spectacular event in the night sky (if we survive until then). Perhaps for this reason, speculations of the impending supernova made headlines when an unprecedented dimming in the star was reported in late 2019 by Prof. Edward Guinan in the Astronomer’s Telegram. With a reported apparent magnitude of 1. 5614, it was the faintest in its history of modern observation.   Figure 2: Betelgeuse seen with VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL before (January 2019) and during (December 2019) the Great Dimming. © ESO/M. Montargès et al. Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain the unprecedented event. These include formation of a dust cloud, gigantic star spots, or an overlapping of the primary and secondary periods. The observed dimming was later confirmed in Infrared as well (Harper et al. , 2021), complicating the mystery because the greater part of its radiation actually belongs to the infrared/near-infrared spectrum. Now, like all stars, Betelgeuse emits radiation at all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, but the intensity at a given wavelength is governed by different factors. The surface temperature, for example, governs the peak observed in the thermal spectrum but there could be localised temperature changes on the surface (star spots), driven by large convection cells. Presence of dust and gas in the circumstellar environment affects the visible region and causes scattering in the UV. Any changes in pulsation also affects the different layers of the star, reflected as variations in different wavelengths. Moreover, these phenomena can happen together, further complicating the interpretation of observed radiation. In the context of Great Dimming of Betelgeuse, it therefore makes sense to ask whether it was a temporary, peripheral phenomenon (such as star spots or dust cloud), or something else, such as changes to the pulsation dynamics (which would likely affect the star as a whole). With this perspective, we investigated the light curve of the star prior to the dimming in all these wavelengths. We start by treating the star as a dynamical system. Multistable dynamical systems: Loosely speaking, a dynamical system is one that evolves in time according to a set of predefined rules. Mathematically, it is a system whose behaviour in time is described by a set of differential equations, subject to some parameters and initial conditions (and external influences). Swinging pendula, celestial bodies in motion, population growth in ecosystems, neuronal synapses, etc. , can all be studied as dynamical systems. Some of these systems can exist in one of many possible states. Such multi-stable systems are very interesting and can serve as models of real systems. Let us understand them with the help of a toy model with two possible stable states as illustrated in figure 3:  Figure 3: Schematic representation of a multistable dynamical system. It can be in any state on the curve depending on parameters and initial state, etc. But given enough time, it will occupy either of the stable states, A or B (indicated by the green ball). Now, when the system existing in state A is perturbed a little, it oscillates around and eventually settles to A. Alternatively, if initially in state B, and given some tiny perturbation, it will eventually settle back down to B. A critical transition in such a system refers to a sudden change in the state, leading to a contrasting dynamics. In our example, it would mean the system going from A to B (or vice-a-versa). The melting of sea ice in recent times and the historically green Sahara becoming a desert, are often cited as examples of such transitions. These transitions are notoriously difficult to anticipate because they happen suddenly. Such transitions are ubiquitous but most recognized in ecology, psychology, and climate. In recent decades, a whole body of literature has focused on the development of so-called Early Warning Signals (EWS), that detect such transitions well in advance. Most of these EWS rely on the assumption of Critical Slowing Down. Critical Slowing Down and EWS: Let us imagine that the structure (or stability landscape) from figure 3 is governed by a system parameter β. Increasing β makes the well corresponding to state A shallower, decreasing the system resilience in this state. Decreased resilience implies that any displacement from state A will now be endured longer, increasing correlation in time. This will also reflect in longer return times (captured in recurrence based quantifiers) and increased fluctuations, causing large variance. This phenomenon is commonly known as Critical Slowing Down (CSD).   Figure 4: In normal conditions (left), small perturbations to the stable state A do not last long and fluctuations are small. But at higher values of system parameter β, the resilience of system in state A decreases, schematically illustrated here as a shallower structure (right). This results in large fluctuations in time (above, right) even with small perturbations, along with longer return times to the stable state. At a certain point, the system reaches a tipping point where the tiniest of disturbance can take the system to the alternate stable state, B. This is called bifurcation-induced tipping (there also exist other types of tipping such as noise-induced tipping and rate-induced tipping, which are beyond the scope of discussion of this article). At this point, the resilience indicators show characteristic trends such as increase in statistical variance (due to perturbations persisting over long time), autocorrelation at lag-1 (correlation in the present state and immediate past state), increase in Hurst exponent (a measure of autocorrelations in the data over different time lags), etc. Similarly, longer return times cause systematic trends in recurrence-based quantifiers. Such trends indicate the existence of a tipping point and are therefore collectively known as Early Warning Signals (EWS) of a dynamical transition. It can be noted that although the example discussed here is a very simple one, CSD and associated EWS have been applied in more nuanced contexts in different areas ranging from psychology, finance, ecology and climate change, etc. Critical transition in Betelgeuse: Coming back to Betelgeuse, we considered it as a dynamical system and analysed the light curve data collected by the The American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO). We identified some of the EWS in this data prior to dimming. The process consists of taking subsequent windows (sections) of the light curve in a sliding fashion (i. e. with some overlap), moving a few data points at a time. Then, statistical measures for these windows are calculated and plotted against time, as shown in the figure 5.   Figure 5: Variation in the (a) Autocorrelation at lag 1 and (b) Variance calculated from the light curve of Betelgeuse upto the dimming (red), during the dimming (blue) and post dimming (green). The left panels (figures 1a and 1b) show the variation from 1990 onwards using a window size of 300 points on data binned every 10 days. The right panels zoom into a region around the dimming, with data binned every 5 days with a window size of 40. Based on the data from AAVSO database.  As we can see, these measures rise prior to the dimming, and serve as strong evidence of a dynamical transition preceded by CSD. Now, we know that the variability in the light curve of Betelgeuse is primarily governed by pulsation. EWS in the data, therefore, hint at a transition affecting its pulsation dynamics. Of course, the credibility of these results relies on statistical significance (further details in the paper). However, there is another way we can verify the existence of a transition—by looking at the variation in other wavelengths. Variations in other wavelengths: The radiation of a star comprises of different components of the electromagnetic spectrum. These components originate due to different stellar processes. In the case of Betelgeuse, the greatest part of electromagnetic radiation is in the infrared. In fact, Betelgeuse is the brightest star in infrared as seen from Earth! Naturally, the variations in this part of the spectrum are highly relevant to understand the dynamics of Betelgeuse. The multiwavelength data discussed in the paper has been taken with permission from Harper et al. (2021). It consists of a simplified three-filter system devised by Wing et al. (1992) for red variable stars. Wing A filter is dominated by the TiO 719 nm (narrow band) and the Wing B and C filters are continuum bands centred around 750 nm and 1024 nm respectively. These filters are carefully selected to measure the infrared magnitude, colour and the spectral type of the star. The primary use of this filter system is for estimating surface temperature of these stars. In addition, this data also includes measurements in the V-band centred around 555 nanometer (nm), that can be compared to the same region in the AAVSO data.   Figure 6: Variation of intensity in Betelgeuse, as captured in Vis/V band AAVSO data (grey), V-band photometry from Wasatonic laboratory (blue), and Infrared Wing three-filter (A: green, B: orange, C: red) data. It is apparent from figure 6 that the dimming was simultaneous in all wavelengths! Further, we calculated the cross-correlation among these wavelengths, and found a systematic decrease before dimming as shown in figure 7:  Figure 7: Pearson correlation coefficient calculated for each pair of wavelengths, indicated here in different colours. These correlations in time decrease prior to dimming. The dimming could be just a normal cycle of the star but brightness variations in the past have never been so extreme (within the limits of available data). Since the infrared radiation comes from deeper layers of the star, we conclude that the dimming was not a surface phenomena. Further, since the dimming was simultaneous in all bands, we can argue that it was related to a dynamical process that affected the whole star, making change in pulsation dynamics the natural answer. The current state of the (stellar) matter: Some of the measurements post dimming seem to validate the dynamical transition. For example, the brightening of the star was almost as quick as the dimming, and the next seasonal cycle was ‘rounder’ than ever! Moreover, later studies found increased prominence of the ~180 day period. These observations suggest a permanent change to the pulsation dynamics. The Great Dimming of Betelgeuse continues to astonish us, even with all the new data we have from Hubble and other sources. Possibilities range from a dynamical transition or overlapping of periodic cycles, to a dust cloud or a large star spot, but (sadly) almost certainly not a supernova! Betelgeuse is a complex star—full of mystery—and we excitedly await to observe and understand more about it in the future.

    "title": "How do astronomers understand the evolution of young stars in star clusters?",
    "body": "2022/09/06 -  This article is based on the paper published in the Journal of Astrophysics &amp; Astronomy. The article shows the results of our deep optical photometric observations of a young cluster NGC 1893 taken with the 3. 6m Devasthal Optical Telescope. Based on the optical data obtained with the data along with the Gaia data, we characterized the young stars in the central region of the cluster and determined their age, mass and membership. We found that the distribution of masses of young low-mass stars in the cluster is similar to that of other Galactic clusters.  Our analysis suggested a primordial mass segregation in the cluster.  Stars form out of dense clouds made up of molecular gas and dust. A majority of these stars emerge as groups or clusters. Star clusters contain stars that are gravitationally stable against dispersion for reasonably long periods of time. Stars in a cluster have the same age and chemical composition (metallicity) but differ in mass and hence are found in different evolutionary stages, allowing astronomers to test stellar evolution theory. Recent observational studies of nearby star-forming regions show that more than half of their young stars are associated with groups of ten or more stars. Therefore, young star clusters are crucial to understand the physical processes involved in the birth and evolution of stars and star clusters.   Fig. 1 : A young cluster NGC 1893 in star-forming region Sh2-236(Credits: A color-composite image created using DSS2-R (blue), Spitzer-IRAC 3. 6 micron (green) and Spitzer-IRAC 4. 5 micron (red) images. ) Star clusters enable astronomers to place the stars of a wide range of masses within the Hertzsprung-Russel (HR) diagram that shows the relationship between a star’s temperature and its luminosity and infer their evolutionary stages and physical parameters, such as age, mass etc. The mass of a star is one of the most important factors providing constraint to its future evolution, but it is not clearly known what determines the exact mass of a newly forming star. One aspect of this problem is the knowledge of the distribution of stellar masses, initial mass function (IMF), in a star cluster.  However, the precise statistics for low-mass stars (stars smaller than the Sun) are somewhat uncertain as they are faint. The theoretical basis for the IMF, variation with the metallicity, environment etc. , is challenged by the observational evidence for the universality of the IMF. With the sensitive instruments mounted on moderate size telescopes, e. g. , Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT), Subaru etc. , that are capable of detecting fainter low-mass stars, now it is possible to shed light on the IMF of the cluster towards the very low-mass end. This research work focuses on a young star cluster NGC 1893 from the New General Catalog (NGC was compiled by J. L. E. Dreyer in the year 1888 and contains about 7840 celestial objects mostly galaxies, nebulae and star clusters). In order to get more insights into the properties of the stars in a young cluster NGC 1893 (Fig. 1), Dr. Neelam Panwar and a team of astronomers of the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) in India performed photometric monitoring of this cluster. For this purpose, they employed the 4Kx4K Imager camera mounted on the 3. 6-meter ARIES DOT.  Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF) software is used for image reduction and analysis. Various programs developed in Python and C++ programming languages are also used for data analysis and plotting. The optical data from DOT were deep enough to reveal very low-mass stars (about 0. 2 times the mass of the Sun) in NGC 1893 (Fig. 2). The DOT data allowed the team to identify about 420 young stars in the central portion of the cluster, out of which 110 turned out to be new members. The study was complemented by archival data from ESA’s Gaia satellite, a sample of young stars obtained using infrared data from 2MASS/ Spitzer space telescope and Chandra X-ray data.   Fig. 2 : HR diagram showing the evolutionary stages for different mass stars (left). Distribution of stellar masses in the young cluster (right). (Credit: arXiv:2111. 11796 ) To determine the physical parameters of the cluster, it is essential to select the stars that are associated with the cluster. Since cluster members share nearly similar motion in the plane of the sky,Gaia Early Data Release 3 catalogue is used to select the kinematic members, i. e. , stars having similar proper motion values and estimate the distance of the cluster using the mean parallax of the cluster members. The young cluster is found approximately 10,600 light years away from the Earth. For faint stars (about V&gt;20 mag which corresponds to about solar mass, as seen in the CMD for NGC 1893) there is higher uncertainty in the proper motion, parallax values. The kinematic information is accurate upto sun-like stars. As the cluster is young (with an age of less than 10 million years), its low-mass members are still contracting towards the main sequence. Hence, the low-mass cluster members are young stars for which the HR diagram (optical color-magnitude diagram) yields ages less than 10 million years. They also studied the mass distribution of the young low-mass stars in the cluster and found that it is similar to other young clusters, i. e. , their results favour the idea of a universal IMF. Observations of star clusters show that relatively massive stars are often found to be located toward the cluster centre. It is not well understood if this mass segregation is due to the dynamical evolution of the star cluster or if this is related to the star formation process itself. Their analysis also suggested that stars with masses above half of the solar mass are located toward the cluster centre as compared to the stars with masses lower than this limit, indicating primordial mass segregation in the young cluster Original paper:Deep V and I CCD photometry of young star cluster NGC 1893 with the 3. 6m DOT First Author: Neelam Panwar Co-authors: Amit Kumar, S.

    "title": "Why are some jets curved: presence of dancing blackholes?",
    "body": "2022/08/30 -  A small percentage of the ejected hot plasma flows (the jets) from supermassive blackholes are observed to deviate from their intended path, resulting in unusual jetted morphologies. One of these peculiarities appears when the jet starts to dance /precess around an axis, forming curved jets with S-shaped morphology. When we observe such sources through radio telescopes, we see a massive S-like structure floating in the vast cosmos. Due to their peculiar morphology, the formation mechanism of such sources is still debated. Simultaneously, an increasing number of such sources are being discovered with even more complex S-shaped structures, making the unravelling of the underlying physics more difficult than earlier.  A blackhole is a voracious cosmic giant that feeds on surrounding matter to grow. Its gravitational pull is so strong that anything that enters inside a certain radius (known as event horizon), finds no way out, not even the fastest thing in this universe; the light photons. There is no limit to how large a blackhole can grow in size. The largest of them are supermassive blackholes (nearly a billion times more massive than the sun; SMBH), which are found at the centres of galaxies. Some of these SMBH enter into an active phase (not yet fully understood how), during which they accrete matter (surrounding hot ionised gas/plasma) at an accelerated rate, with some of this material being violently ejected down the SMBH’s spin axis due to a complex process caused by a powerful magnetic disturbance. The super-heated plasma material that is thrown out traverses a distance ranging from sub-parsec to a few megaparsec in space with a velocity nearing the speed of light. Just to compare with our usable scales, one parsec is 3. 26 light-years (a distance that light travels in a year). These ejected streams of matter are called jets, which are destined to propagate along a straight path while carrying the magnetic field from their origin. As a result, they mostly emit radiation at radio frequencies due to the synchrotron process (a process where charged particles radiate when they move in curved paths in magnetic fields), and hence we need radio telescopes to observe and study them.   (Credit: https://fermi. gsfc. nasa. gov/science/eteu/agn/) A small percentage of these ejected hot plasma flows (the jets) are observed to deviate from their intended path, resulting in unusual jetted morphologies. One of these peculiarities appears when the jet starts to dance /precess around an axis, forming curved jets with S-shaped morphology. When we observe such sources through radio telescopes, we see a massive S-like structure floating in the vast cosmos. Due to their peculiar morphology, the formation mechanism of such sources is still debated. Simultaneously, an increasing number of such sources are being discovered with even more complex S-shaped structures, making the unravelling of the underlying physics more difficult than earlier. Some examples of these radio sources are highlighted below.   Top image: Image of SS 433 (obtained from VLA radio telescope), a micro-quasar in our galaxy (similar system to what we are discussing here, but with a smaller length scale) showing the presence of bidirectional precessing jets. [Credit: NRAO]. Bottom image: Another example of precessing jets of a powerful radio galaxy 4C +12. 50, studied by Lister et al. 2003. (Credit: SS 433, 4C +12. 50) To uncover the underlying mechanism that produces these sources, I, along with a team of Indian scientists, have conducted a study where we tried to numerically (using computer simulation) reproduce an observed peculiar S-shaped source that has recently been observed using the Expanded Very Large Array Telescope in New Mexico. The source has a technical name 2MASX J1203. At first appearance, the jets seem to propagate along a straight line from the compact core of the galaxy (centre of mystery!) and end in hotspots (places where jets terminate or encounter a major collision with the ambient medium). But afterwards, the jets suddenly bend in opposite directions, making a structure that looks like a wing. This is why it is called an S shaped winged source. Our novel simulations have modelled this peculiar galaxy using a precessing jet and have shown that it is not only the jet precession that causes such ambiguities in morphology but also the galactic medium through which the jet is travelling shape the structure. The heavy galactic medium (mostly gas) exerts additional force on opposing jet’s free propagation leading to slowing down the jet significantly, as well as causing it to be unstable as it propagates to longer distances. The resultant structure, when observed from a fortuitous viewing angle (the orientation angle an object makes with respect to the observer here on Earth), we see the formation of such peculiar S-shaped winged sources on the sky plane; what we see in the sky is just a two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional objects.   Credit: arXiv:2206. 04705 To elaborate our work a bit more, we have carried out computer simulations by adopting a novel approach where we modelled not only the observed morphology but also the underlying micro physical processes of this radio structure. To answer the morphological peculiarity of the source, we first built a setup where a precessing jet is being injected from the centre of a realistic galactic medium whose time evolution we have further followed. As time progresses, the precessing jet grows in size, and at time 2. 23 mega-year, a fully grown dancing jet is formed. When you see this structure from a particular angle (the line-of-sight), the structure will appear as an S-shaped source with extended wing-like substructures.   Credit: arXiv:2206. 04705 I must mention that finding this fortuitous line-of-sight angle, as well as the jet parameters that perfectly mimic the observed source (2MASX J1203) was quite a challenging task. This is because the existing models that tend to predict these parameters of dancing jets have seemed to ignore the jet deceleration effects imparted by the ambient medium, which have been self-consistently adopted in our simulations. As a result, our study pointed out that for a better determination of precessing jet’s parameters, numerical simulations are a better choice. Furthermore, when we started to model the synchrotron emission part of this structure, we found out that the galaxy is radiating at a higher level that contradicts the theories if we consider that the hot plasma of the jet is radiating away its energies via radiation as well as via adiabatic expansion of the whole system with time. This further hint that the radiating non-thermal particles are somehow getting re-energized, which is keeping the structure alive for a longer time than what has been anticipated from theories. Using our simulations, we explicitly demonstrated that diffusive shock acceleration is the physical factor that assists the particle in regaining energy supplied by the generated shocks in the medium. These shocks were formed by the jet’s supersonic flows (flows that move faster than the sound speed in that medium), which caused the source to be more active than it should have been. A significant question now arises: why did the jet begin to precess in the first place? Let’s say we have a water fountain that sprays water to a certain height. Now, if we want to make the ejected stream of water precess around an axis, one has to externally precess the nozzle from where water is ejected. Similarly, in our astrophysical scenario, the blackhole that is responsible for jet ejection has to be precessed by an external force. It has been theorized that a secondary supermassive blackhole possibly orbits close to the primary one, causing the spin axis of the primary SMBH to precess. The secondary SMBH came from another galaxy that has recently collided with the existing one, resulting in two SMBHs in a single galaxy. It has been observed that galaxies do collide with each other, and in the local Universe, the rate of it is significant too. Hence the systematic dance of the binary blackholes most possibly have made the jet to precess. In this regard, our numerical simulations have successfully constrained the precession period of the jet, using which one can calculate the separation of the binary BHs. In general, only a handful of dual AGNs have been discovered yet, maybe because we are looking at the wrong sources. Nonetheless, these sources with curved/bent jets can now be the ideal candidates to look for dual SMBH pairs at their centres, detection of which can further help us better understand the evolution of supermassive blackholes throughout the Universe.

    "title": "Core-collapse supernova from a possible progenitor star of 100 solar mass",
    "body": "2022/08/29 -  Supernovae are extreme astrophysical transient phenomena marking the death of stars. In this article, I take you to the journey of the life of a star as massive as 100 times our sun. Through the state-of-the-art simulation tool MESA, we have studied the overall life of a 100 solar mass star and the implications of the resulting supernova. At the time of its birth, the 100 solar mass star is around 10 times bigger than the current size of our sun, while in the last stages of its life, it has evolved to around 1700 times the current size of our sun. The energy released from the resulting supernova from such a massive star would be so powerful that it would take around 100 million Suns shining together for a period of at least a few hundred days.  Looking up into the sky on a clear and dark night, we can see thousands of stars twinkling. While sleeping on the rooftop of my home in our village during summer days, I used to wonder why the night sky looked similar every night. The stars present in the sky last night used to appear in the sky every other night. Similarly, seeing the constellation Ursa Major (popularly known as Saptarishi Taramandal in Hindi) shining brightly with its seven visible stars every summer night, I used to scratch my tiny mind about the unchanging nature of the heavens. But, do the heavens remain unchanged? No, not at all! Similar to the lifespan of a human being, every star that we see in the sky has a finite lifetime. Accumulation of cosmic clouds gives birth to stars in the form of spherical blobs by burning hydrogen as fuel in their core. These stars grow older while spreading a tremendous amount of energy in the form of light/radiation and finally die with no active fuel burning left in their core. The death of each star (for less massive stars having masses &lt; 8 M⊙ subjected to mass accretion from a companion) is marked by one final, massive detonation or explosion, and the phenomenon is known as a supernova (SN), an event so bright that even if it occurred in another, very far galaxy, it could be seen from the telescopes available on earth and in space. The only difference between the lifetime of humans and stars is that humans can have a lifespan of around a hundred years or so only, but the stars live for a few million to a few billion years of age! This is the reason why the heavens in the night appear unchanged every night when seen through the naked eyes. However, as I mentioned above, the heavens change, with supernovae (SNe) being one of the means. So, has there been any bright supernova event in human civilizations that could have been seen through the naked eyes? Yes, nine such events have been identified and recorded by human civilizations in the past 2000 years! The first SN event was recorded in 185 A. D. by the ancient Chinese, as referenced in the work of two Roman chroniclers. Around 200 years later, two bright SNe in 386 A. D. and 393 A. D. were also recorded. The fourth one is the most bright SN in human history, which occurred in the year 1006 A. D. , an event so bright that it could cast shadows on the ground. The fifth and sixth SNe seen through the naked eyes occurred in 1054 A. D. and 1181 A. D. , respectively. The remnant of the SN that occurred in 1054 A. D. is known as the very famous crab nebula. The seventh and eighth SNe seen through the naked eyes occurred in 1572 A. D. (known as Tycho’s supernova) and 1604 A. D. (known as Kepler’s supernova). The ninth SN seen through the naked eyes occurred just a few decades earlier, in 1987, named SN 1987A. Our sun is a star in our galaxy Milky Way which hosts about a billion other stars, many of them having masses greater or lesser than our sun. Further, in the known universe, there are billions of other galaxies, each of them hosting billions of stars. However, the SNe can be so bright that they can outshine their entire host galaxy and can be seen through the telescopes on earth even if they are occurring in other galaxies (or, in other words, being extra-galactic). Once such SNe is detected through space-based or ground-based telescopes, they are followed up, and their brightness is recorded until they become fainter beyond the detection limits of telescopes. For SN, the variation in brightness (or intrinsic luminosity) over a period of time is called its light curve.  With the state of the art software and simulation techniques, we are now capable of studying the lifespan of a star. We can numerically evolve a certain mass star from birth to death and study its implications. A review of one such work is presented in this article. Here, we have studied the life span of a star as massive as 100 M⊙. Figure 1 shows the change in the size of 100 M⊙ star as it evolves through various phases of its life. This star starts as a relatively smaller blob of gas, evolves to grow bigger, and during its last evolutionary stages, it has grown in size, having a radius of a few 1000 times bigger than our sun.   Figure 1 : The evolution of the size (measured by its radius) of a 100 solar mass star as it gets birth (left panel), becomes an adult (mid panel), and finally reaches the stage where it is about to die (rightmost panel). The subplot in the left-bottom corner marks the star's position on HR diagram (which is the variation of luminosity with effective surface temperature). The figures are also color-coded with blue meaning hot and red meaning less hot. These figures have made use of the results from Aryan et al. 2022. (Credits: Author) During the last evolutionary stages (approaching its death), the star is mainly composed of inert Iron in its core, and the burning of fuel in the core has almost stopped. Due to this, the core of the star is vacated of any radiation. The role of the presence of radiation in the core of a star is vital as it is the source of radiation pressure responsible for balancing the self-gravity of the core. But, when the core is vacated of almost all the radiations, there is no support to the self-gravity of the core, and it starts to collapse under its own gravity resulting in a core-collapse supernova.   Figure 2 : (Left )The variation of the core temperature (Tcore) and core density (&rho;core) as the 100 M⊙ star is born and evolves older to reach the last evolutionary stage reaching on the verge of core collapse. The blue triangle marks the core temperature and density at the birth of the star, while the red solid circle marks the same when the star is on the verge of death. This panel makes use of the results from Aryan et. al 2022. (Right) The light curves of supernovae resulting from the death of a 100 M⊙ star by keeping total explosion energy constant and varying the amount of total nickel mass. For comparison purposes, the light curves of three similar type supernovae are also shown but these three supernovae result from much lower mass (10 - 20 M⊙) stars. This figure has been adapted from Aryan et al. 2022. The left panel of Figure 2 shows the variation of core temperature (Tcore) with core density (ρcore) as the 100 M⊙ star evolves from its birth (marked by a blue triangle) to the stage where it is about to die (marked by red solid-circle). We could see that near the last evolutionary stages, the core temperature and core density have reached in excess of 1010 K and 1010 g cm-3, respectively. Keeping such high density in a normal human life perspective, a matchbox full of such core material would weigh around 200 million Kg! The right panel of Figure 2 shows the light curves when a 100 M &amp;odot; star explodes as a core-collapse supernova. The resulting SNe are Type IIP-like that are identified by a phase of nearly constant luminosity (also called plateau phase) in their light curves. The length of the plateau is dependent on the size of the Hydrogen envelope retained by the star. So, we can see that SN 1999em, SN 2005cs, and SN2009N have shorter plateau duration, as they arrive from much lower stars having masses in the range of 10 to 20 M⊙. Further, in the right panel of Figure 2, on increasing the Nickel mass while keeping the explosion energy constant, the duration of the plateau in the light curve is increased. This behavior due to the increase in Nickel mass is attributed to the increase in energy deposition in the expanding ejecta by the γ rays that are produced by the radioactive decay of Nickel (56Ni) and Cobalt (56Co). One can also notice that the explosions from such a massive star would be so humongous that they would radiate at a rate of 1040 ergs/s or more for at least a period of 350 days. Again putting it in an observational perspective, it would be equal to around 100 million Suns shining together for a period of at least 350 days! Thus, the core-collapse supernovae are extreme catastrophic phenomena and are among one of the major events marking the alterable heavens. Keeping these aspects of supernovae in mind, we conclude that the heavens do change. It only requires an eye of a keen observer to see the change!

    "title": "Revealing the nature of the brightest & explosive astronomical sources in the sky using 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT)",
    "body": "2022/08/22 -  India has a long history of more than two decades of observations of optical counterparts of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using Indian meter-class telescopes like the 1. 04m Sampurnanand Telescope (ST), 1. 3m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT), 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), and 2. 34m Vainu Bappu Telescope (VBT) utilizing the longitudinal advantage of the place. In recent times, astronomers started exploring these exciting and explosive astronomical sources using recently commissioned (since 2016) India’s largest optical telescope, i. e. , 3. 6m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) at Devasthal observatory of Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital. In a short period of the proposed target of opportunity (ToO) observations (since cycle 2020-C2), DOT discovered many interesting results such as the detection of long GRB (GRB 211211A) from a neutron star-white dwarf merger, the detection of host galaxies of peculiar GRBs, the detection of most delayed optical flare (GRB 210204A) observed from any GRB so far, etc. This article briefly summarizes the recent discovery of dark (GRB 210205A) and orphan (AT2021any/ZTF21aaeyldq) afterglows of GRBs using 3. 6m DOT + 4K × 4K CCD Imager.  Similar to humans, stars also have a life cycle. They are born, live, and at some point, they die. High mass (more massive than eight solar mass) and low mass (typical to solar mass) stars follow a different life cycle. The death of massive stars produces the brightest and most explosive astronomical sources known as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). GRBs are powerful bursts of high-energy gamma-ray radiation and are among the most exotic phenomena studied in modern astronomy. GRB emits more energy in a second than our Sun will emit in its lifetime. GRB events have two distinct emission phases: one is the short-lived prompt emission (the initial burst phase, peak at sub-MeV energy range), followed by a long-lived multiwavelength afterglow phase. The prompt emission (initial gamma-ray emission) of GRBs is automatically discovered by space-based gamma-ray missions such as NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, India’s AstroSat, and many more. Based on the observed time scale of prompt emission, astronomers classify GRBs as long or short, whether the event lasts more or less than two seconds. Their duration is associated with their origin: long GRBs occur with the death of massive stars, while short GRBs have been proven to be the electromagnetic counterparts of the gravitational wave (originated due to the merger of two compact objects) signals discovered recently by LIGO/Virgo. GRBs are believed to originate from a “jet” moving at a relativistic speed, launched by a fast rotating stellar-mass black hole or magnetized neutron star formed at the core collapse of a massive star (long GRBs, duration &gt; 2 sec) or in the merger of compact objects (short GRBs, duration &lt; 2 sec). The ejected out-flowing can have various shells that can collide with each other creating internal shock, which is responsible for the prompt gamma-ray emission. Later on, this material expands and interacts with the pre-existing material surrounding the GRB events (external shock), producing the broadband synchrotron radiation, which attributes to the afterglow emission (see Fig. 1).   Figure 1: The theoretical understanding of prompt emission and afterglow of GRBs (Credits: Dr. S. Iyyani. ) Soon after the GRB-prompt discovery, ground-based multi-wavelength observational facilities (including ARIES telescopes in the optical/NIR bands) started searching for the associated afterglows across the electromagnetic spectrum. Specifically, optical observations play a crucial role in constraining the redshift, energetics, environments, and geometry of these powerful astronomical sources. The longitudinal advantage of the Devasthal observatory (which lies in between the Canary Islands and Eastern Australia) and deep imaging/spectroscopy capabilities of back-end instruments (at visible and near-infrared bands) of the 3. 6m DOT telescope (see Fig. 2a) together provide a unique opportunity to perform deep and longer follow-up observations of the optical counterparts/ associated host galaxies of GRBs. Based on the optical brightness, some of the optical afterglows of GRBs are defined as Dark GRBs. In the case of dark GRBs, either optical afterglow is very faint or not detected even after a deep and long search using optical telescopes. In addition, a few rare optical afterglows are detected independently without any prior prompt emission detection from space-based gamma-ray satellites, known as Orphan GRBs. This article highlights the recent discovery of dark (GRB 210205A) and orphan (AT2021any/ZTF21aaeyldq) afterglows of GRBs using 3. 6m DOT+ 4K × 4K CCD Imager (see Fig. 2b).

(Credits: Author) In the case of GRB 210205A, an X-ray afterglow was discovered using Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT). We performed the optical follow-up observations to search for the optical afterglow using the 3. 6m DOT + 4K × 4K CCD Imager; however, we did not find any optical afterglow despite deep follow-up observations, supporting the dark nature of the burst. We investigated the possible reason for the optical darkness. We found that either intrinsic faintness of the source or high redshift origin was a possible reason for the optical darkness of the afterglow of GRB 210205A. For AT2021any, no gamma-ray prompt emission counterpart was reported by any space-based satellites, and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF, a survey telescope) independently discovered this source. We also detected this object using 3. 6m DOT + 4K × 4K CCD Imager (see Fig. 2b) and found that it is the third known orphan afterglow with a measured redshift. The detection of orphan afterglows can be explained by one of the scenarios:  If the source is observed on-axis (viewed along the line of sight to the observer on the Earth), similar to typical GRBs, however, the prompt emission of GRBs (the initial gamma-ray counterpart) was unambiguously missed by space-based gamma-ray telescopes, either due to their limiting sensitivity or source was not in their field of view.  Suppose the source is observed off-axis (viewed outside the line of sight to the observer on the Earth). In that case, the emitted flux from the prompt emission decreases very sharply outside the opening of the jet because of the relativistic beaming of photons (when photons are moving with ultra-relativistic speed emit radiation in a beam in the direction of motion). Such faint prompt emission will be very hard to detect by GRB satellites. Later on, as the jet decelerates (due to external shock), the relativistic beaming becomes less intense, and the emission from the jet becomes detectable to observers at larger viewing angles (off-axis). We only detect the afterglow emission without any prior detection of the prompt gamma-ray emission (see Fig. 3).  Figure 3: A schematic diagram showing the possibility of detection of the orphan afterglow from the off-axis scenario. (Credits: Author) In the case of AT2021any, we performed a detailed broadband afterglow modelling (see Fig. 4a) and confirmed that AT2021any is observed on-axis (see Fig. 4b), and a gamma-ray counterpart was missed by GRBs satellites. We expect to detect more similar sources in the current era of survey telescopes with large fields of view like ZTF and others.

(Credits: Author) Our results emphasize that the 3. 6m DOT has a unique capability for deep follow-up observations of similar and other new transients for deeper observations as a part of time-domain astronomy in the future. GRBs are multiwavelength phenomena. Therefore, along with optical/near-infrared observations using 3. 6m DOT, the follow-up observations at other wavelengths using Indian facilities, such as at radio wavelength using Giant Meter Radio Telescope (GMRT) and at UV/X-ray by Indian Space Observatory (AstroSat), may provide a comprehensive picture of these sources.

    "title": "Evolution of plasma parameters during B class flares",
    "body": "2022/08/06 -  In this article, we presented the temporal evolution of elemental abundances during solar flares of GOES B1−B4 class, the weakest events for which such studies have been possible so far, using observations with XSM on board Chandrayaan-2. This study was possible due to the extremely quiet solar conditions currently prevailing along with the availability of appropriate instrumentation. By modeling the soft X-ray spectra obtained with the XSM during different phases of these flares, measurements of temperature, emission measure, and abundances of Mg, Al, Si, and S were obtained. We have shown that the abundances of these elements are nearly photospheric during the peak phase, compared to their 3–4 times higher preflare values. Beyond the flare peak, the abundances are seen to get enriched again and they recover back to the coronal values at the end of the flare. This suggests that during the flares, the coronal loops are quickly filled with plasma originating from the lower parts of the solar atmosphere without having sufficient time for the usually observed fractionation in nonflaring loops to take place. Our observation of the quick recovery to the coronal values shows that any process giving rise to such fraction must be occurring on a timescale of a few tens of minutes.  The Sun’s atmosphere is made up of several layers, primarily the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the corona. The lowest layer is the Photosphere. The temperature of the photosphere is around 5500 degrees, whereas the temperature increases towards the outer layer of the atmosphere and exceed a million degrees at the outermost layer, the corona. The physical mechanism of heating the solar corona to such a high temperature has been a mystery for the last several decades. The current understanding suggests that the magnetic field associated with the Sun is responsible for such high temperatures at corona. The Sun’s magnetic fields are highly dynamic in space and time. Many regions on the Sun are found to have enhanced and concentrated magnetic fields, which are generally known as Active Regions (AR) at the corona. Occasionally sudden bursts of energy are found to release from the AR, known as solar flares. Though solar flares are very commonly seen within the AR, they are also found to occur outside the AR with a small amount of energy release. The modern classification system for solar flares uses the letters A, B, C, M, or X, according to the peak flux in watts per square meter (W/m2) of soft X-rays with wavelengths 1 to 8 Angstrom, as measured at the Earth. The figure below shows the different types of solar flares observed by the geosynchronous equatorial satellites (GOES). X-class flares are the biggest flares seen in the solar atmosphere with a peak flux of &gt; 10-4 W/m2, whereas the M, C, B, and, A-class flares are smaller and smaller flares having peak fluxes 10-5-10-4 W/m2, 10-6-10-5 W/m2, 10-7-10-6 W/m2, and &lt; 10-7 W/m2 respectively (Figure 1).  Figure 1: Soft X-ray flux from GOES satellites. Credit: NOAA GOES X-ray flux. Due to the high temperature, the elements (H, He, Fe, O, Ni, Mg, Si, etc) present in the solar atmosphere are found to be ionized to their different ionization levels at different atmospheric layers depending on the temperature. As the origin of the plasma remains the same throughout the solar atmosphere, it is expected that the relative composition or so-called abundances of these elements remains the same throughout the solar atmosphere. However, the observational studies showed that the abundances of certain elements whose ‘First Ionization Potential’ (FIP; which is the minimum energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from a neutral atom) is lower than 10eV are 2-4 times more abundant in the AR than their photospheric values. This phenomenon is known as the FIP effect. Figure 2 represents a pictorial view of the FIP effect. The x-axis represents the first ionization potential of the elements, whereas the y-axis represents the elements’ abundance ratio (called FIP bias) at the corona and photosphere. All the elements (e. g. , Na, Fe, Ni, etc. ) with a first ionization potential less than 10 eV have FIP-bias of 2-4, representing they are 2-4 times more in the amount present in the corona than in the photosphere. The FIP bias for the elements having first-ionization-potential more than 10 eV (e. g. , Ar, Ne, etc. ) are close to one representing their composition in both photosphere and corona remain the same.  Figure 2: Plot of FIP bias versus FIP Credit: U. Feldman et al. 1992. Though the true origin of the FIP effect is not well known, the present understanding of the FIP effect is based on the upward reflection of the magnetic waves, known as the Alfvén wave, at the top of the chromospheric layer. The cartoon below (Figure 3) represents the process briefly. Here we considered a magnetic-field loop rooted in the lower atmosphere and expanded to the corona. The red arrow represents the increase of temperature with a height from the lower atmosphere. Due to the perturbation of the magnetic fields, Alfvén waves will be present inside the loop and can travel throughout it (as shown by the black arrows inside the loop). As the waves travel from upward to downward, they can reflect from the top of the chromosphere (as shown by the black arrows).  Due to the reflection of the waves, an upward force known as “Ponderomotive force” is experienced by the ions (as indicated by the magenta arrow) present in that layer (see Laming (2015) for details). The ions influenced by the Ponderomotive force travel to the corona and increase their concentration to the corona. The temperature and pressure at the top of the chromosphere are such that only the elements having FIP less than 10 eV can ionize, whereas the high FIP elements remain neutrals, resulting in only the ions of low FIP elements present at the top of the chromosphere to be influenced by the Ponderomotive force, thereby increasing their concentration in the corona.  Figure 3: Schematical diagram of the Ponderomotive force model. Credit: Laming et al. 2012. Thus the present understanding of the FIP effect is based on the reflection of the Alfven waves generated due to the perturbation of the magnetic field lines. These Alfven waves are related to the mechanism that heats the solar corona. Recently, it has been believed that the FIP effect is the bi-product of the coronal heating mechanism. Thus measuring the abundances and hence the FIP bias can be a tracer to understanding the origin of the FIP effect as well as the coronal heating mechanism. The FIP effect has been studied extensively in quiescent AR closed-loops and during the peak of big solar flares. During the peak of the big flares, a low FIP bias has been found compared with the closed-loop ARs.  However, the detailed picture of the FIP effect during the flare is not clear as the time evolution study of elemental abundances during the solar flare was limited due to technical limitations of the present generation instrument (e. g. , sensitivity: lowest flux that an instrument can detect, instrument’s energy resolution: the capability of an instrument to distinguish the emission lines present at nearby energies, cadence: time gap between two successive observations, etc. ). Generally, the elements’ absolute (i. e. , relative to the H) abundances are measured using the spectroscopic technique. A recent instrument, Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM) onboard the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft, provides the spectrum of the Sun every second in the broad energy range of 1-15 keV. Its good spectral resolution and sensitivity have been useful for time-resolved spectroscopy. In time-resolved spectroscopy, the instrument provides the spectrum of the detected photons at each time step, and then analyzing each spectrum corresponding to a time step, we extract the characteristics of the incident photons on the detector. One can study the abundance evolution during solar flares using such a technique. During the period from 2019 September to 2020 May, covering the minimum of Solar Cycle 24, XSM observed nine B-class flares ranging from B1. 3 to B4. 5. The observed XSM light curve (blue color) for one of the flares is shown in Figure 4a. Light curves of the same flare as observed by the other instruments (non-spectroscopic) are also shown by gray and brown colors. For the time-resolved spectroscopy, we used the XSM observed spectra at different time intervals throughout the flares, as shown by the green and orange shaded background colors. Representative XSM spectra for three different durations as marked by the “1”, “2”, and “3” are shown in Figure 4b. All the line complexes observed in the XSM spectra are annotated in the plot.  Figure 4: Spectroscopic analysis from Chandrayaan-2 XSM. Credit: B. Mondal et al. 2021. Analyzing the spectrum of each of the shaded duration as marked by green and orange color in Figure 4a, we estimate the temperature, emission measure (EM; which is a quantity to quantify how much emission is coming from the source at a particular temperature), and absolute elemental abundances of four elements–Mg, Al, Si, and S throughout the flares. These are the first measurements of abundances during such small flares, and this study offers a unique insight into the evolution of abundances as the flares evolve. The results are shown in Figure 5. The flare light curve is plotted in a grey curve. Panels ‘a’ and ‘b’ (black and red color represent the results obtained from two different methods of spectral analysis; for detail, see the reference paper) show the evolution of the temperature and EM during the flare. In the impulsive phase of the flares, due to the sudden release of the energy, both temperature and EM increase as flares evolve. After the peak of the flare, the flaring plasma starts to cool down and reach the background plasma temperature at the end of the flare, as shown by the blue horizontal line.  The abundances of the Magnesium (black and red points in panels c) decrease toward their photospheric values (shown by the green horizontal band) during the impulsive phase of the flares. During the decay phase, the abundances are observed to quickly return to their pre-flare coronal values (shown by colored horizontal dashed lines as reported by several authors). A similar evolution of the abundances of other elements (Al, Si, and S) are also observed.  Figure 5: Representative results of temperature, emission measure and Mg abundance for one B-class flare. Credit: B. Mondal et al. 2021. The decay of the abundances (or FIP bias) during the impulsive phase of the flares can be explained by invoking the process of chromospheric evaporation, the process in which the photospheric materials come up to the corona. However, the quick recovery (in a few minutes time scale) of the abundances from near photospheric to coronal values in the decay phase of the flare can not be explained by the present theory of the FIP effect alone, where to develop the FIP bias a time scale of 1-2 days is required. There are two possible scenarios that can explain our observation, as described in Figure 6.  Figure 6: Models to explain the observed FIP bias and its evolution. Credit: B. Mondal et al. 2021. In the first scenario, Figure-6; (1a) Impulsive phase–After the flare onset (at time t0), heat energy travels down to the chromosphere and evaporates the plasma there. The process of evaporating the plasma from the chromosphere is called chromospheric evaporation. The temperature peak is identified at the start (time t1) of the chromospheric evaporation. During the initial phase, plasma evaporates with high velocity and quickly passes through the fractionation layer (top of the chromosphere, where the reflection of the downward propagating Alfvén waves occurs and the ions are separated due to the Ponderomotive force) without getting fractionated, resulting in depletion of the coronal FIP bias. The EM peak is achieved (time t2 ) once the loop gets filled with the chromospheric plasma. At around the same time, the abundances of the low-FIP elements also attain their minima. (1b) Decay phase–The speed of the evaporative up-flow slows down significantly, allowing plasma enough time in the fractionation layer to get fractionated. The fractionated plasma eventually fills the coronal part of the loop, thereby demonstrating the recovery of the coronal FIP bias. (1c) Representative temperature, EM, and elemental abundance evolution curves. Time t4 marks the time of complete recovery of the coronal FIP bias. In the second scenario, Figure-6; (2a), At the time of the flare onset (time t0 ), high amplitude Alfvén waves are initiated. The released heat energy gets transported to the chromosphere by suprathermal electrons (high energetic electrons), at speeds faster than those of the Alfvén waves. Evaporation starts at time t1 and reduces the coronal FIP bias. The temperature peak is observed around this time. (2b) The EM peak and abundance minima are achieved when the loop is filled with the evaporated plasma (t2). Once the flare-driven Alfvén waves arrive at the chromosphere (time t3 ), they rapidly fractionate the plasma. These Alfvén waves also carry significant heat from the flaring site to assist the evaporation. The fractionated plasma is then transported to the coronal part of the loop through evaporative upflows, which help in rapidly recovering the coronal FIP bias. (2c) Representative curves of temperature, EM, and elemental abundances for the second scenario. Earlier studies during the peak of the big flares (X or M) found photospheric abundances, but how the abundances became photospheric was not very clear. A time-resolved spectroscopic observation with a good resolution was essential to study the problem in detail. Here using the recent X-ray spectrometer, XSM onboard Chandrayaan 2 orbiter, we did time-resolved spectroscopy during the B-class flares and showed the complete evolution of the abundances during the flares.  The results suggest that the coronal loops are quickly filled with plasma originating from the lower parts of the solar atmosphere during the flares. During the decay phase of the flares, the abundances reach their 3-4 times higher pre-flare values within a few tens of minutes. These results will help us to understand the origin of FIP bias during flares and provide constraints to develop the model of the FIP theory. This study suggests that measuring the abundances during the flares is an important tool to get insight into the flaring process. The B-class flares are much smaller than the large X or M-class flares. Thus it is expected that even smaller class flares could show a similar variation of the abundances during the flares. Studying smaller flares is of great interest in the entire solar physics community as it is believed that the smaller flares occur very frequently and heat the solar corona to million degrees. In follow-up work, we will study several much smaller A-class flares and compare the results with the present study.

    "title": "General Relativity And Its Effect On A Deformed And Misaligned Pulsar",
    "body": "2022/08/02 -  Observed pulsars are misaligned in nature. The misalignment scenario occurs when the rotation axis and the magnetic axis of the star forms a finite non-zero angle between them. This scenario gives rise to very interesting phenomenons. This article explores such a misaligned star which is oblate in nature due to the deformations of rotation would vary considering general relativistic corrections. Our calculations show some interesting features regarding the magnetic field, power loss and also the charge separation on the surface of such a star. Introduction: Neutron Stars (NSs) are very dense objects found in the universe, having masses ranging from about 1. 4 MΘ ( MΘ is the Solar mass) to about 2. 2 MΘ . NS are the highly dense collapsed core of a a star of mass 8 MΘ to 20 MΘ formed after a supernova explosion. The central density at the core of the NS is about few times that of the nuclear saturation density. The predictions of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) state that at such high densities, nuclear matter won’t be the stable state and the quarks present inside the nucleons will get deconfined resulting in a stable quark matter. Until now, there are no earth-based experiments that can probe such densities nor any reliable theoretical calculation. Therefore the only laboratory to test the theory of deconfinement at high density is at the core of the NS. Very fast spinning NSs are also known as pulsars. Observed pulsars have a dipolar magnetic field with its magnetic moment directed along an axis known as the magnetic axis. The pulsars rotate about an axis called the rotation axis. These two axes are not directed in the same direction (they have some finite angle between them), and such pulsars are known as misaligned pulsars.  A schematic diagram of a misaligned pulsar. The cyan-coloured spherical object is the pulsar which rotates about the rotation axis (blue axis), and the magnetic moment is pointed along the magnetic axis (red axis). The charged particles move with a velocity (v) as shown in the figure. The black lines show the closed magnetic field lines of the star. Image courtesy: author.  In our recent publication, we have tried to provide a realistic model for such a pulsar. For simplicity of calculations, people tend to assume the star is aligned (the magnetic axis and the rotation axis coincide). Still, in reality, the pulsars found in the universe are misaligned. We have also considered the deformation due to the star’s rotation about its axis to provide a more accurate model. Thus our star tends to form an oblate shape, which adds an extra challenge to our calculations since we cannot assume the star to be spherically symmetric, which would have simplified our calculations. The general theory of relativity, given by Einstein in 1915, shows that heavy objects tend to curve the space-time. Since NSs are more massive than our sun, we need to consider these general relativistic effects to have the most accurate model possible. Results: This work done by me, along with my supervisor Dr. Ritam Mallick, and my collaborator Dr. Debojoti Kuzur, shows some interesting results. Our calculations show that along the star’s equator, the strength of the magnetic field reduces with an increase in the misalignment of the star. As there are no direct means to measure the misalignment angle, our calculations conclude that a pulsar which has lesser magnetic field near the equatorial plane compared to another pulsar having a higher magnetic field near the equator can be said to be more misaligned than the later. The pulsar will also lose its energy due to its rotation. We also studied how the general relativistic calculations differ from the known Newtonian approach of finding the power loss of the star. We see that with an increase in the misalignment angle of the star, the power loss increases, to a certain angle, after which it takes a sharp dip and rises again. As the star rotates about its axis with extremely high angular velocity, the charges near the star’s surface would separate as a result. This would result in the accumulation of the negatively charged particles called electrons near the poles of the star-forming dome kind of shape, and the positrons will accumulate near the equator of the star, forming a torus. The charge density near the star’s surface for such a scenario is called the  Goldreich-Julian charge density of the star. We also calculated the Goldreich-Julian charged density for our model and compared it with the known model for the Newtonian case. Our results report changes from the known nature of the charge density distribution from the previous values.   Top: Figure shows the comparison of the Goldreich-Julian density for the Newtonian and the general relativistic case, the x-axis denotes the polar angle &theta; and the y-axis denotes the charge density in cm-2. As we increase the angle &theta;, i. e. we move from the star's pole towards the star's equator, we see a change in the sign of the charge densities. At the pole of the star, we see more electrons (negative charges), and as we move towards the equator, we see more positrons (positive charges). 	 Bottom: The plot shows the comparison of the power loss for the deformed pulsar for different values of misalignment angle &chi;. The yellow line shows the results obtained from the general relativistic plot. The green coloured line shows the power loss for known Newtonian methods.

    "title": "The International Moon Day",
    "body": "2022/07/20 -  On account of International Moon Day, we present a brief overview of the formation scenarios of the Moon. We also discuss the findings of Chandrayaan.  “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. ”: This is the famous quote by Neil Armstrong during the live broadcast when he stepped on the Moon for the first time on 20 July 1969. The Apollo-11 mission was regarded as the biggest technological achievement by NASA. Armstrong and Aldrin had spent around 21 hours at a location known as Tranquility Base on the lunar surface collecting lunar samples. After spending more than eight days in space, the group returned to the planet and touched down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24. To celebrate this great feat, the United Nations marked the 20th July of every year to be celebrated as “International Lunar Day” in its resolution 76/76 on ‘International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space’ in 2021. To mark this day, in this article, we provide the current understanding of the formation of the most familiar astronomical object we see in the sky, the Moon and the Indian lunar missions. Moon has been an important part of the history of mankind, be it popular literature, religion or navigation. Scientific observations of the Moon date back to the 1600s, when Galileo Galilei turned his telescope towards the Moon to reveal its surface. Contrary to the popular belief that the Moon has a smooth surface, a topology abundant with craters and mountains was received with great surprise. Since then, we have had many scientific ventures to understand the Moon in great detail. Luna-2, by the Soviet Union, was the first spacecraft to reach the Moon and Apollo-11 by the United States made the Moon the first astronomical object other than Earth, where mankind had set foot on. Many studies have revealed important aspects of the Moon. Among all that, the most interesting question is about the origin of the Moon. George Darwin, in 1879, put forward a hypothesis about the formation of the Moon. He proposed that the Moon was formed from a piece of mass that spun off from a rapidly rotating Earth in its molten phase during planet formation. This hypothesis is called the fission hypothesis (Figure 1).  Figure 1: Distribution of offset between magnetic field direction and clump orientation. Credit: Moon formation fission. Later, the capture hypothesis (Figure 2) suggested the possibility of capturing of the Moon during a close flyby in Earth’s gravity field. In this scenario, the Moon was believed to be formed elsewhere in the solar system.  Figure 2: Fission hypothesis. Credit: Capture Theory. A co-accretion model (Figure 3) was suggested alternative to both the stated hypotheses. This model predicted that the Moon and Earth formed at the same location around the sun by accreting the same material.  Figure 3: Capture hypothesis Credit: Co-accretion Theory. So far, these hypotheses started to break when we started understanding the Moon’s composition and bulk nature after the Apollo missions. The composition of the samples returned by the Apollo astronauts showed that Earth and Moon shared the same isotopic composition. And it was also seen that the Moon’s bulk iron content was less than Earth’s. The three stated hypotheses explaining the Moon’s formation could not explain these results. This led to a new hypothesis called the Giant Impact Hypothesis (Figure 4).  Figure 4: Giant Impact: An artistic impression Credit: Giant Impact Hypothesis. In 1975, William K. Hartmann and Donald R. Davis proposed the Giant Impact Hypothesis. It explained that 4. 5 billion years ago, after the Earth was formed and solidified to have a solid crust, it underwent a collision course with a Mars-sized planetesimal object which co-evolved in the neighbourhood of Earth. This impact caused rocks and debris to be collected in orbit around the Earth, and eventually, it accreted to form the Moon. This hypothesis could explain the same isotopic composition of Earth and Moon since both were created from the same material. By the time Earth had formed its solid crust (when the giant impact had happened), the heavier iron element in its composition had sunk to form an iron core of Earth. Hence, the material that was ejected from Earth’s crust and mantle as a result of impact was iron deficient. This explains the iron-poor nature of the Moon. As this impact theory can explain many known facts about the Moon, the Giant Impact hypothesis has been the long-standing theory that explains the origin of the Moon. Understanding the global abundance of various elements and minerals on the Lunar surface will help us to validate and model the Giant Impact hypothesis. India’s moon orbiting satellite, Chandrayaan missions has significantly contributed to this direction. Chandrayaan-1 was India’s first mission to the Moon. Moon mineralogy mapper (MMM, also known as M-cube), a payload onboard Chandrayaan-1, detected the trace of water at the poles of the Moon. Another payload, C1XS (Chandrayaan-1 X-ray Spectrometer), could detect major rock-forming elements on the surface and reported the first measurement of enhanced sodium on the lunar surface. Due to the short lifespan of nine months of Chandrayaan-1 around the Moon, a global elemental map remained unachieved until India launched Chandrayaan-2 in 2019. Chandrayaan -2 was an ambitious mission that carried a lander, rover and an orbiter. The Vikram lander was designed to soft-land on the lunar surface, and the rover named Pragyan was made to traverse the lunar surface performing experiments on the surface. But unfortunately, both Vikram and Pragyan hard landed on the Moon, making them unusable. The Orbiter, which carried eight scientific payloads, orbits the Moon giving valuable scientific data since 2019. A global elemental map of various elements is awaited as a major result of Chandrayaan-2. This vital data can shed clues to validate the existing hypothesis for the formation of the Moon. These studies will help us make the biggest leap to understanding the formation scenario of the Moon.

    "body": "2022/07/17 -  Stars take birth in molecular clouds. The presence of magnetic fields everywhere in the universe naturally creates a curiosity to investigate their role at all the stages of star fomation. The motion of clouds through the interstellar medium in the presence of magnetic fields may get effected and can shed light on the structure/orientation of stellar nurseries.  This short article will explain these possible effects in an interesting region of our Universe, Cepheus Flare.  Understanding how stars are formed is one of the crucial questions in astronomy. Molecular clouds are the blank spaces or voids in between stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way and they consist of predominantly hydrogen or helium molecules. They are stellar nurseries in our local galaxy and the universe. The prestellar/protostellar cores are the high density nested quantities in large molecular clouds with a typical temperatures of 10 K and density of ~ 103 cm-3. They are considered as the fundamental units for the formation of stars.  Figure 1: Schematic of cloud of radius Rc moving in a uniformly magnetized background medium with a velocity, Vc making an angle θ with the field linesCredit: Miniati et al. 1999. Magnetic fields, which are ubiquitous to the universe, is a very interesting property. Due to their interaction with the ionized material, they can play an important role in the dynamics of the clouds. The angular offsets between the direction of the cloud motion and the magnetic fields, θ is shown in Fig. 1. These offsets can help in preventing the disruption of the cloud (radius Rc moving with velocity Vc) against the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the interstellar medium as suggested by simulations.  Figure 1: Schematic of cloud of radius Rc moving in a uniformly magnetized background medium with a velocity, Vc making an angle θ with the field linesCredit: Miniati et al. 1999. Stars which are young are still associated/embedded in the high-density clouds because the surrounding molecular material has not completely collapsed towards the centre. Their motion in the projected plane of the galaxy is defined as proper motion. Stars move in the interstellar medium (ISM) and their proper motion is a critical factor in determining their overall motion in the galaxy.  Proper motion can serve as a proxy of the motion of the clouds in the ISM. A team of researchers led by Dr. Ekta Sharma and Dr. Maheswar Gopinathan from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, an autonomous institute of the Department of Science &amp; Technology, Govt. of India and Dr. Sami Dib from Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Denmark carried out an observational test on a sample of clouds (L1228, L1251, L1172/1174 and L1147/1158) located at a nearby distance of ~330 pc in Cepheus Flare region identified in Fig. 2. The Gaia (Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics) and Planck, both are space based observatories to study the motion of stars and the emission in far-infrared wavelengths, respectively. The authors used proper motion data from Gaia Data Release 3 to study the motion of the clouds in sky plane (shown by arrows in Fig. 2) and Planck polarization data to construct magnetic field maps.  Figure 2: Background image in color scale is cloud emission in far-infrared wavelengths obtained by Planck satellite. Blue arrows show the direction of proper motion. Credit: Sharma et al. , 2021. They estimated various offsets between the direction of magnetic field and the motion of the clouds in the sky. The results show that the magnetic fields are ordered in all the clouds except one cloud, L1172/1174 which shows an offset (angle, θ in Fig. 1) higher than 30°. The authors suggest that the higher offset could be responsible for converting the cloud material in the form of hub-filament structure (see Fig. 3). These structures consist of a hub having less aspect ratio with high column density and a number of filaments with high aspect ratio with less column density.  Figure 3: Schematics of Hub-filament systems. Credit: Kumar et al. , 2020. Starless cores are the earlier stages in the process of star formation which have not formed stars and the pretsellar cores are the ones which are on the verge of making stars. We made a quantitative analysis of the core orientations (direction of major axes) (in Fig. 4) with respect to the magnetic field in case of starless as well as the prestellar cores. The distribution for all the clouds is found to be random. The study concluded that the core dynamics could be affected more by the local variations in the magnetic field in the cloud’s environment. The results of this study have been published in the journal “Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics”.  Figure 4: Distribution of offset between magnetic field direction and clump orientation.

    "body": "2022/06/30 -  Yash Bhargava from Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, takes us through the journey of the death of a star in this wonderful article about his work.  To understand what I do, I will have to take you on a journey of what happens after a star dies. Yes. Stars also die. Depending on its mass and composition, a star can die either by blooming into a red giant and then dispersing its external shell to leave a bright core at the centre, known as a White Dwarf, or by a gigantic explosion which can typically outshine a Galaxy - leaving either an extremely dense ball made almost entirely of Neutrons (also known as Neutron Stars) or an enigmatic Black hole at the centre. It becomes more interesting if the original star was already revolving around another star also known as the companion star. If the companion is close and large enough, the compact star (either White dwarf, Neutron star, or Black hole) is in a position to capture material from the companion. When matter from the companion is captured in the gravitational well of the compact object, it doesn’t simply fall towards the compact object.  The matter would have an initial velocity which would force it to go into an orbit around the compact object. After a huge number of collisions, a fraction of matter would eventually form a disk around the compact object, something similar to the Rings of Saturn but with a tiny but very important twist. The matter in this disk is actually moving inwards while the particles in Saturn’s ring are orbiting the planet in a very stable manner. Hence these disks are called accretion disks. As the matter moves inwards closer to the compact object, it releases the gravitational potential energy. The closer the matter can get to the compact object, the more gravitational energy is available to be released. The conversion of the gravitational potential energy in the disk is a very efficient mechanism making these sources extremely bright.  The amount of energy being expelled is quite large, which raises the temperature of the matter so much that it emits radiation peaking in X-rays. Observing X-rays from ground-based observatories is impossible as the incoming radiation is blocked by the atmosphere. Thus scientists have sent many observatories to space to observe and study these enigmatic sources. One such observatory is AstroSat, which is India’s first multi-wavelength mission. It has 5 co-pointed instruments onboard to probe different properties of the target.   Figure 1: An artist’s impression of accretion around the Black hole binary Cyg X-1. The typical emission from the accretion disk is in X-rays while the jet emits from Radio to X-ray wavelengths. (Credits: Chandra X-ray Observatory) Black hole Binaries are systems of binary stars in which the compact object is a Black hole. As compared to Neutron Star and White Dwarf, Black holes are more dense and compact, thus presenting a deeper gravitational potential well. Close to the Black hole, the extreme gravity, and relativistic effects dominate. Thus these systems are excellent laboratories to probe extreme conditions that are impossible to recreate on Earth. They also show very unique features which have not been completely understood to date. One of these features is a Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO), which is like an oscillation with many close-by frequencies occurring simultaneously. In contrast, many Neutron star binaries show pulsations that correspond to the rotation of the Neutron star and have only a single frequency, thus making them a great clock. The origin of QPO is quite uncertain as some observations indicate that it is a geometrical effect while others imply it is a resonance feature. Previous studies have indicated that the QPO might be related to precession in the accretion disk. But no single model can fully explain the properties of QPOs.   Figure 2: An example of a Quasi-periodic oscillation observed in MAXI J1535-571. The plot shows the power density spectrum, which is the square of the Fourier transform of the intensity variations with time (often called the light curve in the astronomical community). The QPO is highlighted as the grey shaded function. The features at harmonic frequencies (twice &amp; half the QPO frequency) can also be seen. ) As part of my research, I have studied different Black hole binary systems which have provided valuable insight into the dynamics of accretion disks. One of these systems, MAXI J1535-571 is quite intriguing. It was discovered in September 2017 and was one of the brightest objects in the X-ray sky when it went into an outburst. AstroSat stared at the source for 5 consecutive days and using the instruments on board we have a unique insight into the source. We have modeled the energy spectrum (which is a count of how many photons of different energies are we seeing) of the source using the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) and the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC), which tells us that this source has a high-temperature accretion disk and a cloud of electron which intercepts some of the energy from the disk and then scatters it to higher energies. The cloud of the electrons can be characterized by the slope of the high-energy spectrum seen by LAXPC. We find that during the observation, this slope is not constant and fluctuates about a mean value.   Figure 3: The X-ray spectrum of MAXI J1535-571. The emission from this source can be characterized by the multi-temperature accretion disk and Compton up-scattering of the accretion disk photons by a thermal cloud of electrons. The total emission was absorbed by neutral Hydrogen close to the source before reaching us. The emission from the Compton up-scattering of the photons depends on the electron temperature and the optical depth and manifests itself as the slope of the spectrum. ) LAXPC is a high time resolution instrument and allows us to measure when a photon strikes the detector with an accuracy of 10 microseconds. Thus we can determine if there are any fast oscillations occurring in the source. In this particular case, we see a very prominent QPO which also changes its frequency about a mean value as the observation progresses. We also measure the total output of the source which is dependent on the total accretion rate of the system and we find that it is increasing as time progresses. Models of QPO predict that, typically, the peak frequency of a QPO is linked with the accretion rate; as the accretion rate increases, the QPO frequency also increases. We find that for this source this is not the case for at least the duration of our observation. We see a very strong correlation between the variation in the QPO frequency and the spectral slope indicating that the origin of the QPO is tightly linked with the component responsible for shaping the spectrum. Whenever the QPO frequency increases the slope increases and when one decreases the other is also seen to decrease. These results led us to conclude that the QPO is closely tied to the cloud of electrons instead of the accretion disk where the previous theories expect it to arise from. This work questions the existing models of QPOs and accretion and demands the revision of long-held ideas. This work and observations like this provide us with a window into a tiny region, extremely close to a Black hole that cannot be yet imaged with the current technologies. Only recently, scientists were able to combine the observations from radio telescopes across the world to create the first picture of a much larger black hole at the centre of the galaxy. But to understand the environment around a black hole in a binary system, indirect measurements (like the work described here) using the spectral and timing properties of the source will remain the primary method of investigation.

    "title": "Anyway the plasma moves - it does really matter!",
    "body": "2022/06/18 -  Light when seen correctly provides rich information on what happens in the cosmos. In this article, we showcase our work on identifying signatures of the solar wind in the solar chromosphere – far lower in the solar atmosphere than what has been expected. We take the reader through our analysis, interpretations and speculations on our observations, and present a unified model of solar wind emergence and the heating of quiet corona.  NOTE: This article is a follow-up to “Understanding the solar chromosphere through spectral lines” (which I shall henceforth call #A1) written by yours truly. While I have presented a summary of the previous article here too, possibly you would enjoy reading them together better! Light, as we have seen in #A1, encodes in it information regarding the world. It is especially of great help to astronomers in figuring out what-where-why something happens. For those of us folks who study the Sun, we are bathed – or rather, burnt crisp with light. And so, light or photons carry with them information regarding various aspects of different regions on the Sun. Now, we have seen in #A1 that each element, or ion has a characteristic fingerprint in the form of “spectral lines”. The properties of these spectral lines depend on the plasma properties where the particular ion is present. Critically, it depends on the local temperature, density, velocity, and any other turbulent flows present in the plasma. These show up as effects on the line intensity, the line “shift” and the line width. And so by “reading out” these spectral lines, we can get an estimate of how much plasma is present, how fast it is moving, and in what direction it is moving – at the very least!. The solar atmosphere is composed of the photosphere (at ~5500 K), the chromosphere (at ~10,000 to 80,000 K), Transition region (TR; ~1,00,000 K) and the corona (&gt;10,00,000 K). The rise in temperature with height of the atmosphere is the rather much debated “Coronal heating problem”, which presents more questions than answers1. The corona then extends outwards as the streaming solar wind, with plasma moving at great speeds outwards from the Sun2. The exact reason(s) behind the large temperature of the corona, and the height (or the layer of the atmosphere) from where the solar wind starts are not known well, and are an unsolved problem in solar physics. In #A1, we attempted to understand the underlying cause of these two problems in tandem by studying two regions called the Coronal Holes (CHs) and Quiet Sun (QS). The CHs are regions seen as dark in the corona against the background QS - see Fig. 1, first panel. However, if we go down to the TR (see Si IV in the same figure), or chromosphere (CII or Mg II k3), these differences vanish! Since the CHs are well known sources of the solar wind, studying these two regions together, and investigating where (and how) this differentiation starts can give us hints on resolving the coronal heating and solar wind emergence problems.  Fig. 1: Fig. 1: CHs (dark) and QS (bright) in the corona (AIA 193 Å), TR (Si IV) and the chromosphere (C II, Mg II k3) with the two regions demarcated by light green contours. Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2022 . In #A1, we had studied the C II 1334 Å line - which forms in the upper chromosphere - in CHs and QS as a function of the underlying magnetic field. The general idea was to check if and how these two regions are differentiated depending on the underlying magnetic field. Our results in #A1 told us that QS is brighter than CHs only if we account for the underlying magnetic field. Similarly, we also found that plasma is both preferentially moving towards, and moving away from us (of course at different places!) in CHs, when compared to QS. This motion (and so the velocity) was found to be larger for regions with stronger magnetic fields! Such a result is counterintuitive – the CHs are known to be the source of the wind which travels towards us. Then why do we see the plasma strongly moving away from us? With this backdrop, let us dive into what other ions in the solar atmosphere tell us! Let us proceed systematically here - we are seeing some “anomalous” results in the C II 1334 Å line: a line that forms in the upper chromosphere. A simple way forward would hence be to check the properties of other lines which form in the same region of the chromosphere. And so, we performed the same analysis on what are called Mg II h and Mg II k lines. Mg II - Magnesium - is an awesome atom from which one electron has been removed. The transitions of this atom give rise to what are commonly called the h and k lines. Why do I call it awesome? Because the Mg II h &amp; k lines are very complex – so complex that in fact they can give us the velocity of almost the whole of the chromosphere! If our results in the C II 1334 Å line were correct, they must be seen in what is called the ‘k3’ part of the Mg II line3. However, we also need to have a comparison against some “expected” results. For this, we performed the same analysis on the Si IV 1393 Å line – this line forms in the TR, and so will give very different dynamics when compared to C II or Mg II. Let us look at the results below! Fig. 2: QS-CH differences as a function of magnetic field (|B|) in the TR and chromosphere. The intensity ratio is depicted in panel a and velocity differences in other panels. Panel b depicts the difference in average velocity, while panels c &amp; d show for the blue- and red shifted pixels alone. Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2022 . In Fig 2, I present all the results we find for Mg II k3 and contrast them with Si IV. The way I present it is as follows: for the intensity, we are only interested in the “factor” by which the intensities are different, while for the velocities we are interested in the differences. The dashed lines depict the intensity ratio of 1/ velocity difference of 0 – i. e, case where no differences are seen. From Fig. 2a, the QS shows more intensity than CH - the factor is more than 1. This ratio is larger in Si IV (TR) than in Mg II k3 (chromosphere). This result is consistent with what we expect from physics – as we keep moving above in height, we will keep seeing QS becoming brighter than CH. In Fig. 2b, we check what the average velocity looks like. In the chromosphere the average CH-QS velocities are similar, while in TR the CH is less redshifted. Hence, we clearly see that the solar wind signature is starting to be seen in TR, but apparently not in the chromosphere. In Fig. 2c, we consider only those regions where plasma is moving towards us. Clearly, we see that the CHs have plasma moving much faster towards us than QS. The difference in velocities is also larger in the TR. This is in-line with our expectation of plasma moving towards us in CHs. And finally in Fig. 2d, we consider only those regions where the plasma is moving away from us. Here we see that while the QS plasma is falling down faster in the TR, the case is reversed in CHs! In-line with what we found from C II in #A1, Mg II k3 also tells us that the plasma is preferentially going away from us in CH at the chromosphere3! So this analysis tells us that the result we are seeing is something truly physical But why could this be happening? Is there an “extra” push for the plasma to flow away from us in the CH, or is the plasma being stopped for some reason in the QS? And where are these flows coming from/going to? A clear dichotomy seems to occur between the chromosphere and TR – something is clearly happening at the interface of these two regions. And so to understand further, we study how the TR velocities change with chromospheric velocities. For instance, if a pixel shows upflow in Mg II k4, what kind of flows does it show in Si IV? And how do these vary between CH and QS? This is a question we ask for multiple spectral lines, but I will just present the results for the Mg II k3 and Si IV below.  Fig. 3: TR and chromospheric flow correlations in CHs (black) and QS (orange). Note that up-flows are blueshifts, and downflows are redshifts. Taken from Vishal. U et al. , 2022. In Fig. 3a, we show downflows (=plasma moving away from us) in TR are related to downflows in the chromosphere. Turns out, the plasma that is moving away from us in TR is also seen moving away from us in the chromosphere, except that in QS the speed drastically reduces. Similarly, we can look at how the upflows (=plasma moving towards us) in TR relate to the upflows in the chromosphere in Fig. 3b. Again, it turns out that the plasma that we see coming towards us in the chromosphere is getting accelerated towards us in TR. However, this time the CH plasma is accelerated more than QS! Next, we can also check if the plasma that is coming towards us the TR has any relation to the plasma that is moving away from us in the chromosphere. In Fig. 3c, interestingly, we find that faster the plasma in TR is coming towards us, faster is it also moving away from us in the chromosphere –with the upflows larger in CH. And finally, in Fig. 3d, it turns out that the plasma moving towards us in the chromosphere has not relation whatsoever with the plasma moving away from us in the TR. This is all very interesting, but what does it mean? It means that: (i). If a plasma parcel is moving towards us in the chromosphere, it would be accelerated even more in the TR. This seems like a signature of the solar wind coming towards us, but starting from the chromosphere – or maybe even lower! (ii). Plasma that is flowing down from the TR is decelerated as it falls down into the chromosphere, and this deceleration is much more in QS, and (iii). There seem to be flows coming out like “jets” both towards, and away from us – faster one end comes towards us, faster is the other end moving away from us! What is going on here? Let us handle each observation one by one, and then try to piece them together. First, why would plasma move? Plasma motion takes place if it is either forced to move due to pressure, or if the plasma is freely falling like a ball falls down once it’s thrown up. The freely falling case applies only to plasma that is falling down – for a plasma that is rising, we need something to pump pressure, like a piston. What could this mechanism be? A graphic summary is given in Fig. 4. In the solar atmosphere, it turns out there are complex mechanisms which can heat a small part of the plasma very quickly. Hot air rises, and similarly the plasma will be forced to rise. These complex mechanisms are generally “impulsive events”, for simplicity. These impulsive events are well known in the corona, and have been hypothesized to maintain the coronal temperature at a million degree Kelvin5! Hence, we may invoke a similar impulsive heat dumping mechanism throughout the solar atmosphere to get plasma moving! Now, the density in the solar atmosphere reduces drastically with height. If the amount of mass crossing a surface at a given time is kept constant, it can be shown that the velocity should increase with height (Fig. 4d). Thus, any upflows starting from the lower chromosphere due to these impulsive events will naturally accelerate, and can persist to great heights. Now, these impulsive events basically just dump some energy very quickly in the plasma. Since the plasma just needs to expand (and not only rise), the expansion can occur both ways – upwards and downwards! And if the energy were dumped between the chromosphere and TR, we will see plasma moving towards us in TR, and moving away from us in the chromosphere (Fig. 4a). These are called “bidirectional flows”. Thus, if more energy is dumped by the impulsive event, faster the plasma will move in both directions! Finally, let this event occur at a very great height – in the corona, for example. In such a case, we would only see the downward flowing plasma, since the upward flowing plasma would be seen in lines which form at much higher temperature. Hence this would be seen as persistent downflows (Fig. 4c)! However, note that the “freely-falling” plasma can also simply fall down, and can give a similar signature (Fig. 4b).  Fig. 4: A schematic showing the response of plasma due to an impulsive heating event (red asterisk). The blue arrows correspond to blueshifts (motion towards us), while red arrows show redshifts (motion away from us). The vertical colour is density – going from high density at bottom to low on top. Different scenarios are depicted across the figure. Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2022 . But how does this explain the difference between CH and QS? For this, we invoke something we kind of know from observations: How does the magnetic field approximately look like in CH and QS. In Fig. 5, open magnetic field lines (in black) are drawn near closed loops (in yellow) in CH, while closed loops alone are drawn in QS. When you have magnetic field lines close by, a phenomenon called magnetic reconnection can occur, which causes field lines to snap and rejoin. This will release a large amount of energy contained in the magnetic field in a very short period of time – these would be our impulsive events! Fig. 5: A schematic depicting the proposed picture of impulsive heating occurring across different magnetic field topologies. In the left panel, we show a CH topology, including open funnel-like structure (black), closed loops of varying sizes (yellow), and impulsive events (red asterisks) due to interchange reconnection between the open and closed field lines, giving rise to bidirectional flows (blue and red arrows). The kinked field line propagating outward as a switchback is depicted as a dashed line, with the approximate propagation direction by black arrows. Right panel: QS topology shown with the same terminology as the left panel. Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2022. The reconnection process itself just needs two magnetic field lines, preferably pointing in opposite directions. However, what happens to the plasma after reconnection depends on the overall shape of the field lines, which guide the motion of plasma. Hence, the resultant of reconnection will be different in CH and QS! In the CHs we have “interchange reconnection” between the open field lines and closed loops. While this gives rise to the correlated motion, the plasma is preferentially guided away from the surface (and hence towards us as blueshifts) along the open field line. The open field eventually takes the plasma away, and puts it out into the solar wind. Since plasma is being taken away along the magnetic field, it doesn’t stay and emit enough light for us to see. However, depending on how predominant loops of different heights are, the signatures would be different. Hence, the solar wind may start from a range of heights, with something specific going on in the interface of chromosphere and TR. In the QS, however, the reconnection is only between closed loops. In this case, while the correlated motion is present, the plasma is not allowed to escape into the solar wind, and is kept trapped inside the loop – this and the CH effect above give rise to the intensity ratio of Fig. 2a. ! However, due to the presence of excess plasma at the bottom (remember, cool plasma can just gravitationally fall down towards the photosphere!) in QS, any downflows will be decelerated in QS. Thus, all our observations are naturally explained by invoking magnetic reconnection in what are called different magnetic topologies! But what about the coronal heating problem? We have actually already described it – the reconnection mechanism! Energy dumping by reconnection is precisely the needed means to maintain the solar corona – however, this occurs across various heights in the atmosphere, but predominantly starting from the TR. Finally, one unexpected result from this scheme of things is the generation of what are known as switchbacks. In Fig. 5, the dashed field lines in the CH are how the magnetic field evolves after reconnection. Over the past couple of years, similar structures have been found in the solar wind, and called switchbacks. If the switchbacks form in the chromosphere/ TR, then the velocities that we provide will serve as constraints on the different models to test out the theory! Thus, in one neat sweep, we can potentially unify solar wind emergence, coronal heating, and switchback generation in a single mechanism! Does this mean we have now solved all of these problems? No! On the contrary, we actually need to perform realistic (a subjective word!) simulations of the Sun to check the viability of various aspects of this model. For instance, we still need to understand some of the following questions: how much energy does a typical reconnection event release? How much of this energy is transformed to velocities of different ions? How much of this energy gets radiated away by the plasma? How many reconnection events typically occur in CHs and QS in the first place? Does all of the plasma eventually escape out into the solar wind? If so, do we find similar results while probing hotter (and cooler) spectral lines? These are some typical questions we are trying to answer in a future work!

    "title": "SARAS 3 telescope refutes astrophysical origins of the claimed cosmic dawn signal",
    "body": "2022/06/12 -  SARAS 3 experiment, designed and developed at Raman Research Institute, has conclusively refuted the claim of detection of the signal from cosmic dawn by EDGES experiment. It has become the first experiment worldwide to reach the required sensitivity and cross-verify the claim. Given the unusual nature of the claimed signal, several non-standard cosmological models were proposed. SARAS 3 findings do not support these exotic models proposed previously. The results are now published in Nature Astronomy.  The first light in the Universe Observations of the cosmic microwave background have transformed our knowledge about the first atoms in the Universe. Similarly, we have a reasonable understanding of our local Universe through multi-wavelength observations conducted routinely via Earth and space-bound telescopes. However, there is a knowledge gap in understanding the transition of the Universe from being filled with hydrogen to the Universe as we know it today. The transition encompasses the very first stars and galaxies and ionization of the Universe through radiation emitted by them. This period, referred to as the cosmic dawn and epoch of reionization, poses several questions. These questions include the formation of the first stars in metal-free environments, heating and ionization of the Universe via radiation from these first stars, and timelines for various events in this period (https://www. cfa. harvard. edu/~loeb/sciam. pdf). One of the ways to answer these questions is to observe the cosmic dawn through radiation emitted by hydrogen atoms. Due to spin-flip transition, the hydrogen atom emits radiation at 21-cm wavelength (rest-frame frequency of 1420. 4 MHz) (https://www. cv. nrao. edu/~sransom/web/Ch7. html#S8). The 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn is expected to arrive on Earth stretched in wavelength to meters and lowered in frequency by the expansion of the Universe to lie in the radio frequency band 50-200 MHz. Each frequency would provide a snapshot of the Universe at a given instant! However, detecting a signal from such an early period of the Universe is extremely difficult. The same frequency range is home to several terrestrial interference sources, including FM and TV stations, satellites, power line transmissions, etc. Even if one were to avoid all the terrestrial interference, our Galaxy emits radiation that is 100,000 times stronger than the strength of the signal! Another part of the challenge is that we do not know what the 21-cm signal looks like, unlike some other cosmological signals. While we have some broader ideas about its nature, its exact characteristics cannot be known owing to our poor understanding of the first stars. It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack while not knowing what the needle really looks like. In such high precision measurements, the radio telescope must have high calibration accuracy to separate the contributions from the instrument, terrestrial interference, and the Galaxy to finally get down to the treasured 21-cm signal. Any small miscalibration of the telescope can lead to a false detection or limit us from reaching the sensitivity levels needed to detect the signal. SARAS experiment SARAS experiment at Raman Research Institute (RRI) is custom designed to detect the faint 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn. SARAS has been meticulously designed and calibrated to measure sky radiation to an accuracy of 0. 0001%. Once built and tested, it is deployed in the remotest sites in India to observe the night skies in a minimum terrestrial interference environment. The observations span over a few weeks, followed by months of analysis, refinement of the design, and re-deployments for a fresh season of observations. Several surveys were conducted early on to find sites conducive to such experiments.   Figure 1: Evolution of SARAS experiment and sites over the years (Credits: Author) EDGES result EDGES is a radio telescope operating in Western Australia. It is led by astronomers at Arizona State University and MIT. The experiment claimed detection of the 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn in March 2018 (https://www. nature. com/articles/nature25792). This was the first discovery claim in the field of 21-cm cosmology and rightly created much excitement in the astronomy community worldwide. However, the detection looked nothing like the theoretical predictions. The strength of the reported signal was at least twice compared to theoretical predictions. Therefore, the EDGES claim of detection led to several speculations about how the Universe might differ from current understanding. These speculations included exotic physics, non-standard cosmology, a new population of galaxies, and new models of dark matter that may have resulted in such an unusual signal. However, appreciating that in such difficult measurements, errors in instrument calibration might result in spurious deductions, cross verification of such a claim had become an urgent priority.   Figure 2: 21-cm signals as predicted by standard cosmology (colored lines) and the detection by EDGES experiment (dashed black line) (Credits: Author). Latest Deployment The third edition of the telescope, SARAS 3, was deployed on lakes with a focused goal to cross-verify the EDGES claim. This was the first instance ever for a radio telescope to observe on water. The reason for floating the telescope on the water is to provide a homogenous medium of high dielectric constant below the antenna. Such a medium enhances telescope performance and reduces confusing radio waves emitted by the very ground beneath radio telescopes. After an extensive search, two lakes in Karnataka, Dandiganahalli Lake and Sharavati backwaters, were selected for observations. The observations were carried out in January and March 2020, ending with a lockdown in Bangalore!    Figure 2: SARAS 3 deployment (Credits: Author) Analysis and Findings Before one can start looking for the presence of the cosmological signature in the data, several corrections are required. These include calibrating the “bandpass response” of the telescope, rejecting the interference signals from terrestrial sources, accounting for the varying efficiency of the antenna over the observed frequency range, and subtracting off the contributions from the telescope and water. This process is followed by adopting a model that represents our knowledge about the emission from the Galaxy and any residual contributions left by the instrument. Once we have a model, we can ask whether the claimed cosmological signal exists in the processed data. By adopting several different methods of asking this question, SARAS 3 observations found no evidence of the signal via each of them. The signal was rejected at 95. 3% confidence. Therefore, the finding implies that the detection reported by EDGES was plausible contamination from their instrument and not a signature from the early Universe. SARAS 3 was indeed the first experiment to reach the required sensitivity and cross-verify the claim of the signal detection. However, 21-cm signal from the early Universe continues to elude astronomers worldwide! Having rejected the EDGES claim, SARAS 3 team is planning more observations on remote lakes in India. At the same time, there is a strong motivation to find pristine sites with little to no interference. One of the best sites imaginable is the far side of the Moon! Effectively shielded from both the Sun and the Earth, it is one of the quietest sites in the solar system to conduct cosmological observations. Therefore, we are proposing a space-based payload, PRATUSH, that would orbit the Moon, conducting observations when in the far side (https://wwws. rri. res. in/DISTORTION/pratush. html). It is currently under study phase, supported by ISRO. Such expeditions will allow us to detect the 21-cm signal from the cosmic dawn and unravel this last remaining gap in the history of our Universe.

    "title": "Bending of Cosmic fountains, giving birth to a peculiar X-shaped galaxy",
    "body": "2022/06/04 -  When observed with a radio telescope, a giant peculiar X-shaped morphology is seen in some galaxies. It is difficult to understand what gives rise to such peculiar morphology; And, to date, this is a topic of debate among astronomers themselves.  Some of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that are billion times more massive than the sun reside at the centre of giant galaxies become active. During this active phase, the SMBH begins to rapidly accrete matter (hot ionized gas/plasma), some of which is violently thrown away along the SMBH’s spin axis by a complex process triggered by a strong magnetic disturbance. Hence, these active SMBHs usually throw jets of hot material out to large distances (out to a few billion light-years) with a velocity nearly the speed of light. These ejected jets resemble a structure that can very well be labelled as cosmic fountains. These jets typically consist of relativistic magnetised hot plasma (as the plasma is thrown, it also takes some of the magnetic field with it), which produce an outburst of radio emission via the synchrotron process. What’s surprising is that jet ejecta, which is expected to follow a particular path (a straight line; determined by the spin axis of the SMBH), sometimes bend from it and form a peculiar morphology that looks like the English letter ‘X’. So, when someone observes these galaxies with a radio telescope, they will find a giant X-like structure floating in the vast cosmos. It is difficult to understand what gives rise to such peculiar morphology; And, to date, this is a topic of debate among astronomers themselves.   In a recent study led by our team of astrophysicists including Indian and Italian scientists, have addressed this issue by re-investigating the formation mechanism of such structures computationally. We identified a possible origin hidden within the host galaxy shape itself. This is quite similar to the Bengali saying, The ghost is already hiding in plain sight. Using computer simulations performed using the Max Planck supercomputing cluster in Germany, we demonstrated the complex relationship between the X-morphology formation and the shape of the host elliptical galaxy, which plays a key role in deflecting the material hurled out by the supermassive black hole. To be specific, the already existing interstellar gas distribution of the galaxy itself is found responsible for deflecting the ejected hot plasma by the black hole sideways, giving the cosmic fountain (the ejected jet) an X-shape. In scientific terms, we demonstrated that as the jet propagates through the denser interstellar gas distribution of the galaxy, the jet head becomes unstable. As a result, it creates lots of back-flowing plasma material that traverse back again towards the centre of the galaxy. While doing so, the host galaxy specifies a path for its motion by providing a path with a maximum pressure gradient (the pressure gradient generates a force), which lies along the minor axis of the galaxy (i. e. , along the shorter dimension of an ellipse). This generated force causes a deflection in the back-flowing plasma, creating the wing structure. Observational studies often find such alignments of these back-flowing materials along the minor axis of the host galaxy, which further supports our findings.   Our novel simulation has also shed light on a decade-old problem of these radio galaxies, which led our work towards a publication in a very prestigious European journal named Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics by ESO (European Southern Observatory). The problem is noted below: Based on the properties of wing structure (which is less intense and rather diffuse than the active lobe), it was believed that the wing is a passively evolving feature (i. e. , simply evolves under normal adiabatic expansion) compared to the active lobe, where the jet is currently in an active stage (by continuously filling itself with fresh and young plasma material from the SMBH). A similar characteristic has also been observed in our simulation showing the active lobe possessing freshly injected particles from the active galactic core, whereas the wing accumulates the older particles that back-flow from the jet head. Based on this, it can be stated that the active lobe should possess spectral index values flatter than the wing (flatter spectra mean younger particles; characteristics of synchrotron radiation). However, in observational studies, no systematic difference in the radio emission (hence in the spectral index) has been found in the four different arms of the X-shape. This further highlights that from a theoretical standpoint, there is a clear lag in the understanding of these galaxies’ emission processes, seriously contradicting the existing formation models. It has also led scientists to address these objects as peculiar sources. This work led by Gourab Giri and the team has offered a resolution to this issue with a critical analysis of these radio galaxies. They highlight that shock acceleration processes of ultra-fast electrons (travelling nearly at the speed of light!) cause such peculiar emission characteristics. A shock wave is a wave that is generated by a moving object when its speed of movement exceeds the speed of sound in that medium. In our work, we explicitly showed the origin of these shock waves in the four arms of X-shaped structure and hence their influence on the radio emission of such peculiar morphologies. The conclusion which came out from our work is that the shock acceleration significantly re-energizes the plasma by speeding them up (hence altering their spectra), keeping the particles alive which instead would have lost all their energy under several dominant cooling processes (radiative and adiabatic cooling). Most importantly, the wing, which was thought of as a passively growing structure of X-shaped galaxies, is actually very active as it produces shock acceleration sites in it. The shocks are generated due to the diverted back-flowing material, as also shown by the black arrow in Fig. 2, making the wing actively evolving. This can single-handedly explain the peculiar emission characteristics observed in X-shaped radio galaxies including the signature where no systematic difference in the emission of lobe and wing is found. Our work has already been appreciated by a greater scientific community. Additionally, the prestigious journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics has also decided to feature our work on the cover page of their upcoming volume. This work is already available on the arXiv preprint server, handled by Cornell University, the USA for open-source science.

    "title": "How much Metal does the Quiet Sun Corona contain?",
    "body": "2022/05/16 -  XSM onboard Chandrayaan-2 observed the Sun during the deepest solar minimum of the past century from in 2019-2020. By studying the XSM spectra for the days when the Sun was very quiet, researchers have found that the abundances of all Mg, Al, Si is around two times higher than its abundances in the photosphere! They also calculated the temperature of the quiet Sun corona to be around 2 MK. This article explains how these measurements were made.  The visible orange-yellow surface of the Sun that we can see even with the naked eye is called the Photosphere. It extends up to a height of 400 km. The temperature here decreases from 6000K, at the bottom of the layer, to 4500K at the top of the layer. This is expected because as we move away from a source of energy and heat, the temperature drops. The next layer is the Chromosphere, that is in between a height of about 400 - 2100 km. The temperature in the Chromosphere varies between about 4000 K at the bottom and 8000 K at the top. As the numbers show, in the Chromosphere, as we move upwards it gets hotter and not cooler as common sense suggests! More mystifyingly, things get extremely hot (literally) as we move into the next layer, the transition region, which is just a 100 km in height but the temperature drastically increases from a few thousand kelvin to a few million kelvin! Temperature stays at a million degree kelvin in the Corona (which extends throughout the solar system) as well, which is the uppermost atmospheric layer of the Sun. The reason for this temperature increase in the solar atmosphere is one of the long standing problems of solar physics referred to as the Coronal Heating Problem. You can read more about this in the article: Using machine learning to infer Solar Coronal heating Figure 1: The Sun and its layers. Credit: Hinode. The Corona is mainly visible in UV and X rays. This is because the hotter a material is, the light coming from it will be of higher energy. You can see this in daily life in the flames of a stove. The innermost regions of the fire will be bluish compared to the outer parts, which will be red, orange and yellow. As we have seen, since the Corona is at a million degree kelvin temperature, it emits mainly in the high energy part of the spectrum, that is, in UV and X-rays, while the Photosphere emits mainly in optical wavelengths that we can perceive with our naked eyes. This means that telescopes on the Earth are enough to observe and study the Photosphere. But since the ozone layer blocks UV and X rays (thankfully, otherwise we would not exist as we do now!), Coronal studies began only with advent of the space age and satellites in the 1960s. Another phenomenon that is related and similarly astonishing to the ‘Coronal Heating Problem’ that occurs in the transition region and the Corona is called as the First Ionization Potential (FIP) Effect. This effect deals with the abundances of elements in the Corona. Soon after the launch of the first satellites with instruments to study the Sun in UV and X rays, Stuart R. Pottasch in 1963 found something very weird concerning the elements present in the Corona. Using spectroscopy, that is, by studying light from the Corona, he discovered that the absolute abundances (i. e. , the abundances with respect hydrogen) of certain elements the low FIP elements like magnesium (Mg), silicon (Si) and iron (Fe) were mode abundant (3-4 times higher!) in the Corona than in the Photosphere. Now you might ask why is this surprising? After all, Corona is a different layer with a very different temperature. So, why can’t it have different abundances of elements than the Photosphere, right? This is because all the material that is present in the Corona comes from the lower atmospheric layers through flares and Coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Flares and CMEs are huge explosions that supply material and energy from the Photosphere to the Corona. So it was expected that the elemental abundances in the Corona will reflect that of the Photosphere. The theories that are trying to explain the FIP effect predict that the FIP effect and the Coronal Heating Problem are intimately connected with each other. Thus studying one problem might give insights about the other and vice versa! Over the years, many studies of the FIP effect have shown that the amount of FIP effect, which basically tells by how much the (low FIP) elements in the Corona are more compared to the Photosphere, is different in different structures of the Corona. Sun’s activity changes with an approximate period of 11 years called as the solar cycle. At the start of a cycle, large flares and CMEs on the sun are usually non-existent. With the progress of the cycle, activity increases, reaches a maximum and starts coming down again before the start of the next cycle. Studies have also shown that the elemental abundance in the Corona changes in accordance with the solar cycle. It is relatively easier to study the Corona when explosions (flares and CMEs) happen. This is because the Sun is very active and outputs a large amount of UV and X rays which the instruments can receive. But studying the Sun when it is quiet requires extremely sensitive instruments to be present and observing the Sun. Here comes in Chandrayaan-2 live a saviour! The Chandrayaan-2 mission was launched in July 2019 and the orbiter carried an instrument called Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM), which is till date the most sensitive instrument to measure the sun’s spectra (light). For more information on XSM, refer to the article:Deciphering The Mysteries of The Quiet Sun Explosions. 2019 also marked the end of solar cycle 24 during which the sun was extremely quiet. This was the quietest the sun has been in the past 100 years! Thus with the Sun in its deep minimum and the XSM observing its inactivity, Santosh Vadawale and team have managed to decode the abundances of three (low FIP) elements - Mg, Al and Si - in the quiescent Corona using spectroscopy. Spectroscopy is the study of light of different energies that is emitted by a source. The instrument that is used for spectroscopy is called as a spectroscope/spectrometer. And the output of a spectroscope is a spectrum (plural - spectra). A spectrum is basically a graph of intensity (or count rate which gives the number of photons) versus the wavelength (or energy) of light. It is possible to derive the temperature and other physical parameters by studying the shape of the spectrum (known as the continuum), and by studying the bumps (called as ‘emission lines or emission complexes’), it is possible to derive the abundances of various elements present in the source (see figure 2). Each emission line is a ‘signature’ of a different element. By modelling (i. e. , comparing the strength of the observed line and shape of the continuum with that predicted by theory) the spectra, we can find the abundances and other physical parameters. For more in-depth information about spectroscopy, please refer to: Understanding the solar chromosphere through spectral lines.

Solid lines represent the best fit isothermal model and the residuals are shown in the bottom panel. Gray points correspond to non-solar background spectrum. Credit: S. Vadawale et al. , 2021. By studying the XSM spectra for 73 days when the Sun was very quiet, they found that the abundances of all three elements (Mg, Al, Si) were around two times higher than the corresponding photospheric abundances. They also calculated the temperature of the quiet Sun to be around 2 MK.  Figure 3: Light curve for the duration of the XSM observations used in this study. Orange shaded regions are duration when active regions were present on the Sun, pink shaded regions are duration when the Sun showed enhanced X-ray activity, and blue shaded regions are duration of quiet Sun observations. Credit: S. Vadawale et al. , 2021. As no activity was happening on the Sun, XSM was even able to measure the absolute lowest X-ray energy emitted by the Sun, which is about 6 x 10-10 Wm-2. For comparison, the highest soft X-ray energy emitted by the Sun is of the order of 10-4  Wm-2, which is 6 orders of magnitude higher!

    "title": "EARTH-SIZED TELESCOPES FOR ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS IN THE LOW RADIO FREQUENCIES",
    "body": "2022/04/24 -  The study of the cosmos is only complete when we can receive and analyse data from the entire electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from picometer-sized gamma rays to several meters long radio waves. This realization is what led to the advent of multiwavelength astronomy. But even in today’s era when technology has paved the way for us to observe the sky in a very wide range of wavelengths, it still remains poorly explored at wavelengths greater than a few tens of meters. This is mainly because the Earth’s ionosphere blocks most of these wavelengths. Even if we could observe them, it would require us to build a telescope several kilometres wide to properly resolve the sources, which is physically impossible. This article is a review of a journal paper that tackles these issues by proposing to simulate an Earth-sized radio telescope. The paper dwells into some technical details on how we can achieve a radio telescope larger than the size of the Earth and discusses the advantages such a system would offer. This article tries to simplify the concepts involved, and introduce the readers to an exciting new domain in radio astronomy. While it is for sure physically impossible to build a telescope larger than even a few hundreds of meters, you might be wondering how the paper suggests we build a telescope not just a few kilometres wide, but larger than the entire diameter of the Earth, which is just shy of 13,000km! To achieve such a feat, it is proposed we build several small observing elements and send them to space, to revolve around the Earth in different orbits. Then we employ some analysis techniques which can cumulatively be known as Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI, or more specifically, orbiting VLBI in our case, as our observing elements are all in orbit) to “stitch” the multiple images taken by each of these elements and produce a high-resolution image of the entire sky. Before we dive further into the how, what and why of the paper, let us first understand in some detail, these concepts involved. Introduction: Radio astronomy is a subfield of astronomy that studies the universe in the radio spectrum (ranging from 1mm to 100km wavelengths). To fulfil this purpose, radio astronomy takes multidisciplinary contributions from physics, electronics and computer sciences alike. Radio waves are so large that we cannot practically use the typical lens and mirror arrangements that we use to observe in most other electromagnetic (EM) spectra. Lucky for us, the larger wavelengths mean smaller frequencies, small enough that we can “see” the crests and troughs of the wave using an antenna – yes, the same antenna that is in our smartphones and TV dishes! In fact, we can actually use our smartphones and TV dishes to observe the radio sky, albeit with a few modifications.   Figure 1: The electromagnetic spectrum and the atmospheric opacity for different wavelengths. While the Earth’s atmosphere is almost completely transparent to short-wavelength radio waves, it is completely opaque to wavelengths longer than 15m. (Source: http://gisgeography. com/electromagnetic-radiation/) A few advantages of observing in the radio frequencies include the fact that most of the high frequency radio waves completely pass through the Earth’s atmosphere. So, we are able to perform ground-based observations, which are cheaper and less complicated. It is also possible to observe astronomical objects or phenomena that are nearly impossible to detect in other wavelengths. But where there are advantages, there are disadvantages as well. Radio waves having wavelengths greater than 15m are blocked completely by the ionosphere, as can be seen from Figure 1, rendering it impossible to make any observations of the radio sky at those wavelengths using ground-based telescopes. Radio waves also tend to be plagued by man-made radio frequency interference (RFI). These can be any signals generated by us, such as the FM and TV frequencies, mobile communication signals, signals from any and all electronic equipment we use, all of which corrupt the astronomical radio signals, making it difficult to study them from the ground. Being able to see the sky at wavelengths greater than 15m is important, because it is expected to be extremely bright with never-before-seen astronomical phenomena. At the risk of using a few technical jargons, the sky at these frequencies will be dominated by non-thermal emissions, such as synchrotron emission, as well as free-free absorption from the thermal plasma that outer space has an abundance of. Interested readers can learn more about these phenomena by referring to this article. Therefore, in order to grab this unprecedented opportunity to observe these new astronomical processes and to avoid the drawbacks of ground-based radio telescopes, we must go to space. VLBI, Visibility and the Image Plane: Interferometry is a measurement technique that relies on the phenomenon of interference of light waves to produce a fringe (interference) pattern. Young’s double slit experiment and Michelson’s interferometer are two common experiments that most of you might have performed in your physics labs in your high school days. VLBI is nothing but an extension of this technique for microwaves and radio waves. In VLBI, a signal from an astronomical source is collected using multiple radio telescopes (called as an array) placed some distance apart. Next, the distance between the radio telescopes is calculated using the difference between the time of arrival of the radio signals at different telescopes. This time difference is usually very small and is caused as the telescopes are located some finite distance apart. This allows observations of an object that are made simultaneously by many radio telescopes to be combined, thus creating a telescope with a size equal to the maximum separation between the telescopes, which is known as the maximum baseline. Since a radio telescope is nothing but an antenna, the signals received by each telescope are converted into voltages. These voltage signals are then amplified, filtered, digitized and then sent to the correlator, a digital device that cross-correlates the signals received from all the telescopes to produce the final image. In simple terms, the correlator “multiplies” each signal with every other signal and computes how well they are related. VLBI is a very popular technique in radio astronomy because it enables the distance between telescopes to be much greater than that possible with conventional interferometry, which requires antennas to be physically connected by coaxial cables or other types of transmission lines. This, in turn, allows for the resultant images to be of much higher resolution. This can be inferred using the Rayleigh’s criterion, which specifies the minimum separation between two astronomical sources that may be resolved into distinct objects. This angular resolution (expressed in arcseconds) for any telescope is given by: where, λm is the wavelength (in meters) and D_km is the size of the effective aperture of the telescope (in kms). In case of any interferometric technique, the size of the effective aperture will be equivalent to the maximum baseline of the radio telescope array. So, to sum it up, we can infer from Rayleigh’s criterion that the angular resolution is directly proportional to the wavelength and inversely to the effective aperture. Therefore, to obtain resolutions comparable to that in visible astronomy, radio astronomers must build telescopes a billion times the size, which is impractical. Instead, they employ VLBI, which gives them the option to use multiple smaller aperture telescopes to synthesize a larger aperture, at the expense of collecting area. ow that we understand the basics of VLBI, let us move on to the next important concept, which is visibility (also known as complex visibility or interferometric visibility by non-radio astronomers). In radio astronomy, visibility is defined as the response of the interferometer, which is the 2-dimensional Fourier transform of the sky brightness distribution. Fourier transform is a mathematical function that decomposes a time signal (which in our case, is the signal that a radio telescope receives) into the frequencies that make it up. This video beautifully explains the concept of Fourier transform, and is a must watch for anyone interested. The sky brightness distribution is given by T(l,m), which is the intensity of radio waves coming from a particular location (l,m) in the sky, where l and m are angles and measured in radians. Finally, visibility is given by V(u,v), which is a complex function of signals correlated from all the radio telescopes in the array. This visibility is measured at a position (u,v) on any user-defined plane (called the image plane or the uv-plane) which usually is the ground for ground-based arrays. The u and v axes are measured in wavelengths (or km, in our case). The image plane can be considered as a simulated aperture of a telescope, and each telescope pair in the array would give two V(u,v) samples (for simplicity, we’ll hereon refer to it as just uv-sample) on the plane at a given time. So, an interferometer array with N telescopes will have N(N - 1)/2 baselines and give twice that number of samples.   Figure 2: The first picture shows three different configurations of the Submillimeter Array represented in blue, red and black colours. They are observing a source at a Dec of +22˚ at a frequency of 345 GHz. The second image shows the total uv-plane coverage when observing for 8 hours, as the telescopes move due to the Earth’s rotation, forming new baselines, and thus, new uv-samples. The black samples are due to the array configuration shown in black and so on. (Source: http://anita. edu. au/lectures) To better understand the concept of image plane, imagine the screen on your phone or computer is the image plane. Now, let’s say every second a pair of telescopes in the interferometer array generates two samples, which correspond to two pixels on your screen. The more the telescopes you have in your array, the more samples are produced every second and the more pixels on your screen light up. Also, the longer you observe a source, the more unique baselines are formed, and again the more pixels on your screen light up. Ideally, we would want all the pixels on the screen to be lit up so that the source being observed is 100% imaged. But that is not possible because the telescopes in our array are separated from each other, and no matter how long you observe, there will always be dark spots on your screen, i. e. , gaps on the image plane. What we can infer from this is that for better imaging, we would need better coverage of the uv-plane, which can be done by observing a specific source over a longer period of time. Refer to Figure 2 for a better visual explanation. To get a better grasp on the concepts of VLBI, visibility, the image plane and radio interferometry in general, interested readers can refer to this article for a basic discussion and this one for a slightly more advanced coverage of the topics. If you aren’t much of a reader, then this 2-video series also does a fantastic job at simplifying these concepts. The system proposed by the paper extends all these concepts into space, with the radio telescopes now aboard satellites revolving around the Earth. Orbiting VLBI is not a new concept in radio astronomy and the proof of concept was shown as early as 1986, by the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) launched by NASA. Following that came the Space VLBI Satellite: MUSES-B under the Japanese VLBI Space Observatory Program (VSOP) and RadioAstron (Spektr-R) operated by the Russian Astro Space Center. An extensive study of the past, present and future of space VLBI can be found in this paper. But all of these multi-element space-based radio interferometers have only been used in conjunction with ground-based telescopes, therefore, rendering them unusable for observations in the lower frequency window that we’re interested in. The increasing interest in the low frequency radio sky, though, has resulted in several fully space-based interferometric missions being proposed such as the Low-Cost Space-based Ultra-long wavelength Radio Observatory (SURO-LC) and Orbiting Low Frequency Antennas for Radio Astronomy (OLFAR), to name a few. These proposed swarms of small satellites would be orbiting close to the Earth or at other special locations within our solar system, such as the Lagrange L2 point or the lunar orbit and would have a large number of observing elements working together in aperture synthesis mode, but with baseline lengths limited to only about a 100 km or so. The novelty of the model proposed by this paper lies in the fact that by performing sensitive imaging observations with very high angular resolutions at low frequencies, we can reveal astronomical objects and phenomena that have never been seen before. These are the prospects that led to the simulation of a suitable space interferometer system so as to enable such high-resolution imaging. The Model: The model was simulated keeping in consideration to have a minimal number of observing elements to view the entire sky. Intuitively, we can see that having just two telescopes in space is not going to be sufficient, so the model begins by assuming three observing elements mounted on satellites in mutually orthogonal and near-circular Low Earth Orbits (LEO), which is an orbit ranging from 300km to 2000km above the Earth’s surface, as shown in Figure 3. Each of the observing elements is assumed to have a uniform field of view (FoV) of 2π steradians (in other words, the telescope can see the entire hemisphere in front of it). Such a configuration would allow us to have baselines of over 15000km, which is larger than the diameter of the Earth, thus enabling angular resolution as fine as 1 arcsec (from Rayleigh’s criterion) even at 4 MHz (or wavelength of 75m). The three satellites have different orbital heights, making their orbital periods distinct from each other. These orbital heights are deliberately chosen such that the orbits are mutually asynchronous. This ensures that the apparent baselines are distinctly different during each orbital cycle, thus giving a significantly better coverage of the uv-plane in a relatively short time span. The orbital speeds and time periods of the satellites can be calculated from the Newton’s law of gravitation:  where, G (= 6. 6710-11 Nm2/kg2) is the universal gravitational constant, Me (= 5. 9821024 kg), R (= 6371km) is the radius of Earth, and h is the orbital height of the satellite above the Earth’s surface.   Figure 3: An illustration of the model configuration: The near circular orbits (not to scale, and appearing in projection as ellipses) for the three satellites are shown. The first satellite has an equatorial orbit (red), and the other two (Satellites 2 and 3) have polar orbits (blue and green, respectively). The black circle in the centre denotes the Earth. (Source: Figure 2 of the paper. ) The various parameter values defined for each satellite are given in Table 1. These values were obtained by extensively testing the sensitivity of the uv-plane coverage to these parameters. The orbital height of satellite 1 is chosen to be greater than 700 km so as to be able to avoid the effects of atmospheric drag which are substantial at heights below 400 km as well as to avoid attenuation of the radio waves due to the ionospheric plasma which is significant at orbital heights below 700 km.       Index    Orbital Height (h)    Orbital Speed (s)    Time period (T)        Satellite 1    770 km    7. 48 km/s    100. 01 min        Satellite 2    1085 km    7. 32 km/s    106. 70 min        Satellite 3    1400 km    7. 17 km/s    113. 53 min  Since the model is different from the usual Earth-based and Earth-and-space-based interferometer systems, the typical definition of the uv-plane as the ground plane would not suffice. So, the uv-plane was explicitly defined in a different manner, with its origin at the centre of the Earth and the plane perpendicular to the direction of the source being observed. After extensive testing, an observing period of 16 days was found to be optimal. In order to obtain the maximum and minimum possible uv-plane coverages during this observation period as well as to find out the extent of the coverages, three exclusive source directions are chosen representing the extreme cases (as shown in Figure 3). These directions, namely A, B, and C, are defined as follows:  Direction A: RA = 03:00:00 Dec = +45 deg, inclined equally to all three satellite orbit axes.  Direction B: RA = 03:00:00 Dec = 0. 0 deg, representing a set of specific directions that are perpendicular to one of the satellite orbit axes (or in the plane of that orbit) and inclined equally with the other two.  Direction C: RA = 00:00:00 Dec = 0. 0 deg, perpendicular to any two of the satellite orbit axes and parallel to the third axis. It can be easily visualized that any source in the sky would fall within the bounds of these three directions relative to them. The corresponding uv-plane coverages are shown in Figure 4 and the evolution of the coverages over these 16 days can be viewed at this link.   Figure 4: The uv-coverages over the duration of 16 days, for the three source directions A, B and C from left to right. The red, blue, and green tracks represent the baseline corresponding to the satellite pairs 1–2, 2–3, and 3–1, respectively. The u and v axes are indicated in km. (Source: Figure 3 of the paper. ) Measuring this coverage quantitatively, it is found that the percentage coverage lies between a maximum of 64% and a minimum of 55. 5% for any source for an observation period of 16 days, which is significantly greater than what we usually obtain with ground-based interferometer setups (which is typically around 15% for the same observing duration). So, the model not only has much greater baselines, but is also capable of giving significantly better coverage for any source, which would ultimately result in very fine angular resolutions and better imaging capabilities at low radio frequencies. The paper then proceeds to discuss the sensitivity of this coverage to the satellite orbits so as to be able to determine the best relative positions of the satellites with respect to each other. Next, it discusses the quality of the final image based on the simulations. Finally, it compares our minimal 3-satellite model with another 4-satellite model, to examine how much of an advantage adding a fourth satellite would be, how that would be reflected in terms of the improvement in uv-coverage and the time taken to obtain the desired coverage. The results indicate that even with a system of four satellites (and six baselines) the total percentage coverage is essentially similar to that obtained with three satellites when observed for the same time duration of 16 days. Although it is noted that when observed for shorter durations, the percentage coverage by the 4-satellite system is noticeably more than that of the 3-satellite one. In conclusion, we discuss the importance of a fully space-based interferometer to observe the low frequency sky with very high angular resolutions and uv-plane coverages and that a minimal configuration with just three elements is optimum for the purpose scientifically, technologically and economically. Easier said than done though, because going to space entails its own challenges. While an elaborate study of them is beyond the scope of this paper, it does acknowledge some of the major ones and discusses possible solutions, showing that there are ways to not only overcome these challenges, but also use them to our advantage.

    "title": "Identifying emission-line stars from a large spectroscopic database",
    "body": "2022/03/16 -  We present a catalog of 3339 hot emission-line stars (ELS) identified from 451,695 O, B, and A type spectra, provided by the LAMOST DR5 release. We developed an automated python routine that identified 5437 spectra having a peak between 6561 and 6568~Å. False detections and bad spectra were removed, leaving 4138 good emission-line spectra of 3339 unique ELS. We re-estimated the spectral type of 3307 spectra as the LAMOST Stellar Parameter Pipeline (LASP) did not provide accurate spectral types for these emission-line spectra. As Herbig Ae/Be stars show higher excess in near-infrared and mid-infrared wavelengths than Classical Ae/Be stars, we used 2MASS and WISE photometry to distinguish them. Finally, we report 1089 Classical Be, 233 Classical Ae, and 56 Herbig Ae/Be stars identified from the LAMOST DR5. In addition, 928 B[em]/A[em] stars and 240 CAe/CBe potential candidates are identified. From our sample of 3339 hot emission-line stars, 2716 ELS identified in this work do not have any record in the SIMBAD database and they can be considered as new detections. Identification of such a large homogeneous set of emission-line spectra will help the community to study the emission phenomenon in detail without worrying about the inherent biases when compiling from various sources.  To understand what emission line stars (ELS) are, one needs to know about the spectrum of a star. Each star has its own unique spectrum, analogous to the fingerprint of humans. A spectrum can be used to identify the properties of the star such as its temperature, chemical composition and (indirect) physical constraints. So clearly, spectroscopy of cosmic objects can reveal lots of information about the universe. Now, let us ask a more basic question. What is a spectrum? To understand this, imagine a rainbow on a rainy day. A rainbow is formed when the sunlight passes through the water molecules suspended in the air after the rain. As the sunlight moves through a spherical water droplet, it gets dispersed into various colours ranging from Violet to Red. This is a real-life example of spectroscopy. The light from a stellar object, when passed through a slit or a prism (the optical equivalent of the spherical water droplet), gets split into various colours. If the light from the star is as ideal as white light is, which is made up of all the colors with equal intensity, we would get a beautiful color gradient with all colors shining equally. However, the universe is not that simple. The spectrum of a star will have bright and dark lines, similar to the way we have ridges and valleys in our fingerprint (Figure 1).   Figure 1: A representative high-resolution spectrum showing the visible light of alpha Boo. The black lines in this spectrum are caused due to various metallic elements present in the photosphere of the cool giant alpha Boo. Image source:N. A. Sharp, NOIRLab/NSF/AURA) . These bright and dark lines (or emission and absorption lines) are the most crucial information of the spectrum. They tell us about the atomic and molecular processes going on in the top most layer of the star which is known as the photosphere. An absorption line is formed in the spectrum when light of a certain wavelength is absorbed by an atom or a molecule. Similarly, an emission line is formed when light of a certain wavelength is emitted (or radiated) by an atom or a molecule. To put it simply, when an atom ‘absorbs’ light, it goes into a higher energy level and when it ‘emits’ light, it comes down to a lower energy level as shown in Figure 2.   Figure 2: The above plots show the absorption and emission process as caused by the excitation and de-excitation of electrons around the nucleus. Image source:webassign . The spectrum of a star is the information that gives us the intensity at each wavelength of light. An observed stellar spectrum consists of the blackbody continuum, absorption lines and in some cases, emission lines. The blackbody continuum in the visible and infrared region is due to the thermal emission of the star and the absorption lines are seen because the ‘cooler’ photosphere absorbs light at certain wavelengths. These two components are seen in the spectrum of all the stars because it arises due to the basic structure of stars. Now let us come to the topic of this article, ELS. Emission lines arise from a hot, gaseous region around the star that is formed due to some special nature of the star. The type of stars that show emission lines in their spectrum are called Emission line stars (ELS). You can call them the rebellious group of star families, who want to be unique by showing emission lines. There are various types of ELS known to us today (and its analogues)Pre-main sequence (PMS) stars - young, naughty teenagers creating chaosClassical Be stars - people with midlife crisisWolf-Rayet stars - old, wise peopleEven though ELS comprises stars in various evolutionary phases, in most cases the emission arises from the equatorial circumstellar disc which is made of gas and dust. The formation mechanism of circumstellar disc varies between different classes. For example, in PMS stars the circumstellar disc is the accretion disc through which material is added to the star from its surroundings. In Classical Be stars, the disc is formed due to rapid spinning of the star which pushes away material from the star to its surroundings. So it should be noted that even though we put stars with emission lines into a single category of ELS, they are very different from each other. Hence, we need to classify them based on their photometric properties. Aim:: As large-scale spectroscopic surveys collect a large number of spectra every night, we need to identify special classes of stars such as ELS and classify them into different categories for the research community to study various emission mechanisms. This is the motivation for the work titled “Discovery of 2716 hot emission-line stars from LAMOST DR5’’. Data:: The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) is a multi-object telescope that can observe around 4000 stars in one night. By its 5th data release (DR5), it had accumulated around 9 million spectra from 2011-2017 which are available to the community. We made use of this huge database to increase the number of ELS stars known to us. One interesting fact about LAMOST is that the majority of observed stars are in the Galactic anticenter direction. This is particularly important because the earlier studies which have identified ELS have not looked into this direction of the sky. So this opened up an opportunity to study ELS in previously less explored parts of the sky. Analysis:: In this work, we took O, B and A type stars (Teff ranging from 30000 K to 10000 K) from the LAMOST DR5 database (for an explanation of different spectral types, look into Anusha R’s CAe article). We restricted ourselves to these spectral types because the main aim of this was to identify new Classical Be/Ae and Herbig Be/Ae stars. Once we removed bad quality (Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) &lt; 10)1 spectra from our list, we used an open-source python package called ‘scipy. signal’ to identify emission peaks. The entire definition of ELS rests on the presence of one of the most commonly found emission line, Hα at 6563 Å. We searched and picked out spectra with the Hα line anywhere between 6561 Å and 6568 Å. This range was selected to take into effect the instrumental calibration defect (if any) and the doppler shift that may be seen in a few stars. We identified 4138 spectra that belong to 3339 unique ELS stars from our analysis. To classify stars into different categories such as CBeAe or HBeAe, we need an accurate spectral type for each spectrum. The LAMOST automated pipeline does provide a spectral type for each spectrum which did not turn out to be accurate due to the presence of emission lines. This introduced the necessity for us to re-estimate spectral type for each spectrum. We followed a technique called template matching. We made use of the MILES stellar spectral library for this purpose. For each spectrum, we matched the templates from MILES library to our target spectrum and identified the best fit. Then the spectral type of the best fit template was assigned to the target spectrum. In order to differentiate between Classical Be/Ae and Herbig Be/Ae stars, we made use of the inherent difference between them known as Infrared (IR) excess. Herbig Be/Ae stars, being young stars, have lots of gas and dust around them in addition to a circumstellar disc. This extra gas and dust reprocesses the energy from the star and emits them in infrared wavelengths. Due to this, the HAeBe stars are brighter in IR wavelengths than CBe stars. Hence we use the photometric data2 available to us to differentiate them based on colors and spectral indices. The breakup of various classes identified in this work is given in the table below.    Table 1: Statistical break-up of various classes identified in this work. Image source:Table 1 of the review paper) . We visually examined the Hα line features belonging to each class and reported their statistics. Finally, a representative spectrum of major classes is presented in Figure 3.   Figure 3: This plot shows a representative spectrum belonging to each of Oe*, CBe, CAe, HBe, HAe, B[em], and A[em] classes. Red dotted lines denote [NII] lines at 6548 and 6584 ̊A and green solid lines denote [SII] lines at 6717 and 6731 ̊A. The spectra are normalized using laspec open source python package. Image source: Figure 7 of the review paper . Future Scope:: This research work identifies new ELS stars from a large database and classifies them into various categories based on their photometric properties. As the data collection capabilities increase day-to-day, the need for such works increases. We have multiple follow-up works in the fray which uses the LAMOST database effectively in identifying and study the properties of CBeAe and HAeBe stars in more detail.

The participants of the discussion panel. Image courtesy: author. After the introductions were over, Sonali Sachdeva from RRI gave a presentation covering opportunities for students as well as interested minds at almost all educational levels. The initial slides focussed on the opportunities in astronomy for school students. For instance, the following opportunities were presented for school students:  Public talks especially for school students which are regularly organized by all participant organisations Schools can invite a scientist to interact with the students (ICTS) Science workshops for students and teachers (JNP) Science Education in Early Development (SEED) Summer Program for students (JNP) Science Over Weekends (SOW) for high school students (JNP) Maths Circle (ICTS) Outreach programs for govt schools in North Bengaluru (ICTS) Young Scientist Program (ISRO)After the opportunities available to school students, the subsequent slides presented opportunities for students at the college level. The opportunities at the BSc and MSc levels were presented in detail. All the participating institutes provided information regarding short or long term research projects under the guidance of their faculty members. The complete information is available in the video. The next part of the discussion focused on the opportunities for prospective Ph. D. students.  Bengaluru probably has the highest number of astronomy Ph. D. students in the country. All the participant research institutes and universities offer Ph. D. programs for students from both science and engineering backgrounds. Students are admitted through national eligibility tests such as GATE/JEST/NET and/or through their own entrance exams, followed by an interview. These researchers can also carry out their research in collaboration with multiple universities/institutes. Information about the opportunities for amateur astronomers was provided by representatives from ABAA and BAS, organizations which have been educating Bengalurians about astronomy and astronomical events for a long time. JNP offers a variety of programs and workshops for people from all backgrounds and expertise. These programs have been attracting thousands of students every year for more than three decades. So far, over 135 students who have benefitted from these programs have taken up astronomy research as their career. The presentation was followed by a discussion session which was quite lively and people asked a wide variety of questions such as the opportunities for primary school children, visits of students to the research laboratories, teacher training opportunities, and support for astronomy clubs in schools. For a lot of questions, the panelists provided their perspectives which provided comprehensive answers to these questions. Further, information regarding new opportunities was provided by the institutions such as ISRO which has launched the ‘Young Scientist Program’. Representatives from IIA provided detailed information about Engineering or astronomy-based projects for the upcoming 30m telescope. Students were provided detailed information about how to apply for research projects at these research institutes. Information about summer programs and internships for MSc/engineering students in all the institutes were also discussed. The links provided at the end of the article provide comprehensive information about these opportunities. From the vibrant discussion, it is evident that Bengalurians are a curious lot when it comes to research happening in Astronomy. It was noticeably observed that parents are particularly interested in exposing their kids to astronomy and science in general from a very young age. The panelists were also excited to share more of their work. This discussion indeed seems like the first step towards the combined efforts of all these institutions coming together to take astronomy to the Bengaluru people. We hope for many more such efforts to follow in the future.

    "title": "Understanding the evolution of the binary star system ‘Cen X-3’: New measurements of the spin and orbital parameters of the system ",
    "body": "2022/03/06 -  Researchers from Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, present the new measurements of the spin and orbital parameters of the binary star system ‘Cen X-3’. This work is a step forward in understanding the complex dynamics of the binary star systems and their evolution.  ‘Cen X-3’ is a binary star system observed in the constellation ‘Centaurus’. It is one of the most luminous X-ray sources in our galaxy and the first-ever X-ray pulsar to be discovered. Scientists from the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune present the new measurements of spin and orbital parameters of ‘Cen X-3’. The results are crucial in understanding the life-cycle and evolution of X-ray binary systems. The work is published in the ‘Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy on AstroSat: Five Years in Orbit’. Researchers used the data from the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters (LAXPCs) onboard Astrosat, for the analysis. Astrosat is India’s first dedicated multi-wavelength space telescope launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 2015. Cen X-3 is a two-star system consisting of a pulsar, a highly magnetized neutron star beaming X-rays, and a companion star. The neutron star is an extremely compact object; as massive as our sun but only a few kilometers across in size! The neutron star in Cen X-3 gravitationally accretes matter from its companion star. The kinetic energy of the infalling matter is converted to other forms of energy including electromagnetic radiation. The neutron star’s magnetic field dictates the accretion flow inside the magnetosphere. The accreting matter is channeled along the magnetic field lines and onto the magnetic poles forming an accretion column. The neutron star’s rotational axis is not necessarily aligned with its magnetic axis. Such misalignment gives rise to highly periodic pulsations hence the name ‘pulsars’.  Figure 1: Illustration of an accretion-powered pulsar. The magnetic axis sweeps earth in every rotation of the neutron star due to misalignment between the rotational axis and the magnetic axis giving rise to highly periodic pulsations. The image used here is available at this URL. Both stars are gravitationally bound and revolve around each other. The binary orbit can evolve due to matter exchange between the stars, mass loss from the binary system, and due to tidal interaction between the two stars. Studying the evolution of the orbit of such systems is important in understanding stellar structure and evolution. The results of these studies can be a direct test for stellar structure models and evolution theories. The first step in doing such a study is to determine the binary orbit.  Figure 2: Determination of a binary orbit from the doppler shift (NS: Neutron Star), Image courtesy: Author In systems like Cen X-3, the companion star is almost 10-15 times heavier than the neutron star. Thus the center of mass of the binary system is much closer to the center of the companion star than the neutron star. In such cases, one can visualize the binary orbit, as illustrated in figure 2 where the neutron star is orbiting around the companion star.  Due to its motion in the binary orbit, the neutron star moves back and forth along the line of sight. The observed frequency of the pulses from the neutron star is shifted due to this motion owing to the phenomenon called the ‘Doppler effect’. Due to this effect, when the neutron star is moving towards the observer, the pulses arrive faster and when the neutron star is moving away from the observer, the pulses are delayed as shown in figure 2. This results in a periodic variation with time in the observed pulse frequency. The rate of this variation corresponds to the orbital period of the system. For a perfectly circular orbit, the pulse frequency variation is sinusoidal. The deviation from the sinusoidal behavior is indicative of the eccentricity in the orbit. Eccentricity is a measure of how elongated the orbit is. The eccentricity of a perfectly circular orbit is zero. The higher the eccentricity, the more elongated the orbit. The binary orbit can be determined completely from this. For a system with a nearly circular orbit like Cen X-3, parameters that can describe the system dynamics completely are:  Neutron star spin period and its rate of change Period of the binary orbit and its rate of change Orbital velocity and radius EccentricityThe evolution of the orbit can be understood by comparing the orbital parameters at various instances of time. Parisee Shirke (IUCAA, Pune) and the team found that the spin period of the neutron star has reduced to 4. 80s from 4. 81s. This means that the neutron star is spinning up which is as per its known behavior. However, the rate at which the neutron star is spinning up has halved. This can be due to variation in the rate of matter accretion from the companion star. The orbital period was found to be around 2. 03 days. The rate of change of the orbital period was observed to be substantially large compared to the previously reported values. The authors state that this could be due to short time-scale variations in the orbital period. The orbital velocity is measured to be around 410 Km/s which agrees with the previous measurements. The projected radius of the orbit has decreased from 39. 66 lt-s to 38. 23 lt-s. This change is in accordance with the observed orbital decay in Cen X-3. The binary orbit is observed to be nearly circular with a very small eccentricity. This work is a step forward in understanding the complex dynamics of the binary star systems and their evolution.

    "title": "Sir C. V. Raman: Raman effect and beyond",
    "body": "2022/02/28 -  We Indians celebrate National Science Day on 28th February each year to mark the discovery of the Raman effect by Sir C. V. Raman. Some of Raman’s discoveries like the Raman effect (for which he was awarded the Nobel prize), Raman-Nath theory, his studies on Brillouin scattering, the soft mode process, etc. are so well known and outstanding, that they tend to overshadow many of his other elegant and significant contributions to the science. We attempt to highlight a few of Raman’s discoveries such that they portray a more complete picture of Sir C. V. Raman and his contributions.    Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman(7 November 1888 - 21 November 1970) Sir C. V. Raman occupies a very special place in the scientific landscape of India. His contributions to science were monumental both in scale and scope. He also played a pivotal role in shaping Indian science institutions and redefined the way in which science was done in India. Max Born, a nobel prize winning german scientist who was instrumental in the development of the quantum mechanics, had this to say about Raman, “There is no Indian physicist of the rank of Raman. No man can compare with him in vigor or intensity. ” The curious case of a relentless experimentalist: It was the year 1921. You could find a turbaned Indian man on a ship returning from Europe to India, running all around, with his nicol prisms and cardboard tubes, collecting sea water from the depths of the ocean. The visual beauty of the Mediterranean ocean had bewitched him. Not so long ago, Lord Rayleigh had shown that the blue color of the sky is due to scattering of light by air molecules. However, according to Lord Rayleigh, the blue color of the deep ocean was due to reflection of the sky in the water. Raman showed, by a simple experiment he performed on board the ship, that the blue color of the ocean is due to molecular scattering and not just due to the reflection of the sky. He quenched the sky’s reflection with a nicol prism at the Brewster angle and found that the blue color “far from being impoverished by suppression of the sky reflection was wonderfully improved thereby”. In 1922, he wrote the celebrated monograph “Molecular Diffraction of Light” and so began the saga of a single-minded man pursuing his vision with a stamina and persistence never seen before, which eventually lead to the discovery of the Raman effect and many other outstanding contributions. Weak Fluorescence: In April 1923, KR Ramanathan, one of Raman’s students, studied the scattering of light in water. Sunlight was focussed on the liquid and the scattered light was observed through a system of complementary filters, each filter completely cutting off the light transmitted by the other. Nothing should have been observed if there had been no change of color during the scattering process. However, a track of scattered light could be observed showing there was indeed a change in the color of light during scattering. This was attributed to a “weak fluorescence” due to impurities which were believed to be present. Raman was not convinced with this explanation though. This “weak fluorescence” was not completely depolarised (as true fluorescence should have been) and the amount of depolarisation changed with wavelength. THE RAMAN EFFECT:  Sir C. V. Raman with the spectrograph (Top) and the first Raman spectra photographed (Bottom)  Newspaper announcements of the discovery of the Raman effect In December 1927, the so-called polarised “weak fluorescence” was observed again by S Venkateswaran in pure glycerine with greater intensity. Due to limited availability of S Venkateswaran, Raman persuaded KS Krishnan, one of his brightest students, to set up experiments to find “weak fluorescence” in various materials. Raman and Krishnan worked together continuously and detected the polarized “weak fluorescence” in all the liquids, gasses and solids they examined. According to Krishan, Raman personally verified all the liquids exhibited this phenomenon. Raman was so excited about the discovery that he rushed to Krishan’s home at night to inform him that their observations were related to the Kramers-Heisenberg process they were looking for all these years. A note was sent to the Nature journal about the discovery. However, Raman continued his experiments, mostly by himself since the observed phenomenon was not yet fully understood. On February 28th 1928, Raman examined the scattered light with a direct vision spectroscope and found that the classical and modified scattering appear in the spectrum as separate regions with a distinct dark region between them, a clear demonstration of a change of wavelength in scattering. The Nobel Prize in Physics 1930 was awarded to Raman “for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the effect named after him. ”  Raman’s Nobel medal and citation Indian musical instruments and acoustics: Even before Raman started working on the scattering of Light, he was fascinated by waves… sound waves! Raman’s father, R Chandrasekhara Iyer was a teacher of Physics and Mathematics and a proficient violinist. That must have influenced him to take interest in the physics of sound waves. Raman himself played violin. At the age of 16, when he was a student of the Presidency college, Madras, Raman commenced his acoustic research.   Illustration of a Veena He investigated whether his intuition that the veena produces the most exquisite musical sound is due to sentiment or has a sound physical basis. The bridge of the veena is so cunningly constructed that the Helmholtz law, which states that the position at which the string is plucked cannot be a node, is violated. Thus this instrument produces innumerable harmonics making its sound closest in harmonic content to the human voice.   The mridangam and tabla produce a succession of musically harmonic overtones in the same way as any stringed instrument A sharp ear with a keen interest in music can detect musical overtones in the sound of the mridangam and the tabla. Raman discovered that the heterogeneous loading of their membranes can produce harmonics - so that in the hands of the masters, the Indian drum is similar to a stringed instrument. Diffraction of light by ultrasonic waves - Raman-Nath Theory: Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Young’s double slit experiment conclusively showed that the interference pattern can be obtained from interaction of light with matter. How about the interaction of light with matter waves!Raman-Nath theory explained a remarkable optical phenomenon that occurs when a parallel beam of light is diffracted by ultrasonic waves. In modern electro-optic instrumentation, the phenomenon of diffraction of light by ultrasonic waves is utilized in acousto-optic spectrometers, which analyze the electrical signal to obtain its power spectrum. Colors in Nature: Raman always had a huge fascination for colors. In the institute that he had built for himself after retirement (now Raman Research Institute), he started building his collection of colorful minerals gathered from all across the world. The collection includes limestones, marbles, alabaster, gypsums, tourmalines, agates, quartzites, jades, amethysts, fluorites, micas, serpentines, iolites, malachites, lapis lazuli and feldspars. Raman studied several of the exquisite optical phenomena displayed by these minerals. Due to lack of basic facilities during the initial days of his new institute, he had to mostly rely on the beam of sunlight to explore the optics of these substances. Even with such simple setups, it is remarkable that he could extract a substantial amount of information about these minerals.    Raman’s collection of minerals Birds are a delight to watch! Raman was very curious about the optical characteristic and the color distribution in birds, since it was so different in different parts of the same bird, in different specimens and in different species that no single explanation would suffice. He would invoke every known optics concept to try to explain these phenomena. He published only one paper on this topic; however talked about it a lot. The interest was not just limited to birds though. “Birds, Beetles and Butterflies” was his favorite title for the talk. He gave dozens of lectures on this subject, each one unique! Diamond: Soon after the discovery of the Raman effect, C Ramaswamy, Raman’s younger brother, asked him to suggest a research problem which he could pursue. Seeing the diamond ring of the newly wed Ramaswamy sported on his finger, Raman suggested the study of scattering in diamond. The famous 1332 cm-1 Raman line of diamond was discovered in the spectrum. Using a 140-carat diamond that was borrowed from the Maharaja of Darbhanga, Bhagavantam, one of Raman’s pupils confirmed this result and also recorded the complex luminescence spectrum around 4152 Å. Raman says this about diamonds, “With their perfect geometric forms and their smooth lustrous beauty they look absolutely fresh from nature’s crucible, although actually taken from sedimentary formations a thousand million years old. The strongly marked curvature of the crystal faces and the smoothly rounded edges are a surprising feature of these crystals”  Sir C. V. Raman with beloved diamond In continuation with his work on diamonds, he also carried out pioneering studies of the thermo-optic behavior of other solids, their photo-elastic and magneto-optic properties, fluorescence, second order Raman effect, infrared spectroscopy, etc. It is perhaps not well known that X-ray topography was discovered in this laboratory while studying the imperfections in diamond. He also worked on lattice dynamics, visual perception and many more topics and made contributions in those areas. It is almost impossible to give a complete description of his diverse research interests and achievements in a single article. More elaborate descriptions about the scientific works of Raman can be found in “C. V. Raman : A pictorial biography” a compilation by S Ramaseshan and C Ramachandra Rao. Pioneer of scientific research in India: Throughout his career, Raman played an integral role in the development of the Institutes that he was part of. During the early 1900s, most of the Indian universities were teaching universities. There was a general belief that new science can not grow in the country and all the young bright minds were sent abroad for ‘training’. Raman, setting his own example, cultivated the culture of scientific research in India. He made an active effort to bring the best minds in the world, like Max Born, Schrodinger, Ewald, Peierls, Kuhn and many more to India. He thought, bringing such great minds could start a scientific movement in the country. Unfortunately, only Max Born could accept his invitation. Raman founded the Indian Academy of sciences in 1934 with the main objective of promoting progress and upholding the cause of science. Central to this mission was to publish scientific monographs and journals through which research discoveries could be disseminated worldwide. The proceedings of the Indian Academy of sciences was considered as one of the top journals up until the 1950s. The annual meetings of the academy, so called ‘traveling circus’, were the main source of science encouragement in the country, with Raman usually being the star performer. Today, the academy publishes twelve journals in different areas of science and science education, in addition to more than fifty books that have been published over the years.

    "title": "Understanding the solar chromosphere through spectral lines",
    "body": "2022/02/27 -  This article takes the reader through a journey of inferring the cosmos - specifically our dear neighbour Sun - through various properties of light. The journey meanders through our work on understanding solar chromospheric properties through spectral lines, and seems to cluminate in the sea of questions raised by our work!  Light is one of the most fundamental, complex and inherently mind blowing things to exist in this world. Every culture across the globe attributes (or attributed) great significance to light, while adding multiple layers of symbolism and meaning. Light has its influence right from the chloroplasts in plants converting water &amp; nutrients to sugar and Oxygen, to the largest of solar panels to generate electricity for entire cities. Light is, in some sense, our window to this world. The same is true for astronomers. Imagine an astronomer working - I am pretty sure your immediate thought is a person looking through a telescope in the night sky. Well, you are pretty correct - in that most information about the universe comes to us through light! But light is not just what we see: the radio frequency on which mobile phones operate is light, and so are the X-rays which are used to check for bone fractures. What kind of light exists depends on how it is generated in the first place. The simplest way to make light is to get objects hot. A hot iron rod glows red, while an arc welding plasma glows blue. Heat, and temperature are primary drivers of what kind of light comes out. This colour of light is given by the wavelength (or the frequency) of light. The larger this frequency of light, smaller the wavelength is, and more the energy in light. X rays have a very short wavelength (and so high energy), while Radio waves have a very long wavelength (and low energy). Similarly, red light has a larger wavelength than blue (or violet) light. So, in general, hotter objects have more energy, and hence emit more in short wavelengths, while cooler objects have lesser energy, and emit more in longer wavelengths. This is the reason why X-rays are generally much more harmful than Radio waves1. The Sun we see every day is obviously a hot object. So logically, we also expect it to give light corresponding to how hot it is. And this is quite true – the solar surface or the solar disc we see in the sky is at 5500 Kelvin. Hence, it emits most of its energy near greenish-yellow light2. But all parts of the Sun do not preferentially emit this greenish-yellow light – rather, depending on the temperature, different parts of the Sun emit in different colours. In Fig. 1 below, I have displayed the same region of the Sun as seen in different wavelengths. The hottest plasma is seen in the 94 Å image, while the coolest is seen in the 2796 Å image - with temperature (approximately) reducing with increasing wavelength. Each structure contains material at different temperatures - this is because different structures form at different heights! A general rule of thumb in the solar atmosphere is “hotter stuff forms at greater height than cooler stuff”3, so the S shaped loop in the 94 Å image forms much higher than the structure in the 2796 Å image.   Fig. 1: A solar flare as seen in different wavelengths (listed on top of each panel). Shorter wavelengths mean more energy. From 94 &Aring; to 2796 &Aring;, as temperature reduces, different structures in the solar atmosphere are clearly seen, from S shaped loops to longer loops to finally a dark sunspot-like patch from 1600 &Aring; onwards! Images assembled from AIA data (corona) and Slit-Jaw Imager (chromosphere).  This is just one aspect of the light that comes to us. The other aspect is that the material which emits this light, also leaves an imprint on “how bright” the light is at different wavelengths. This is slightly different from the Thermal radiation, which depends only on the temperature. The typical brightness at every wavelength for light coming due to an object being hot, looks somewhat like the top row in Fig. 2. Here, notice that the brightness shows some variation with wavelength (which, I remind you, is given by the colour of light) - but the essential point is that every wavelength has some amount of brightness. Now, check out the second row - corresponding to a Sodium atom. You will see that the brightness is present at discrete locations in wavelength, and most of the wavelengths have no brightness. This is in stark contrast to the thermal radiation, and is followed similarly by all other elements listed in the rows below Sodium. But note that the pattern, or location &amp; brightness of these spectral lines of different elements is unique for each element. In a sense, spectral lines can be thought of as a fingerprint of atoms and molecules. Just like each human has a unique set of fingerprints, similarly each atom or molecule has a specific set of spectral lines as its signature. These lines you see are bright in specific wavelengths, and are called emission lines.   Fig. 2: Examples of many spectrum (=spectra). On the bottom most axis, the wavelength increases from 4000 &Aring; (left) to more than 7000 &Aring; (right). The top row shows what is called a continuous spectrum, which depends only on the temperature of the object. Each subsequent row shows how much bright light is in each wavelength, for different atoms listed to the left. Image source: OpenStax . Astronomers study the spectral lines of different objects like stars, galaxies, etc, and try to figure out which all atoms, ions and molecules are present in the object of study. Remember, what I have shown in Fig. 2 is the light coming from one vertical slit - that is why, the spectral lines are all seen as vertical lines. But this need not be the case - I can also look at approximately one point on the Sun (or even average over the vertical line), for example, and get its spectrum out. This exercise will give us a result similar to Fig. 3, where we just have the brightness of light for every wavelength. This is the kind of spectrum astronomers generally analyze.   Fig. 3: The intensity of various spectral lines as a function of wavelength. Taken from CHIANTI.  A side note here: The spectrum shown Fig. 3 is the brightness (or rather the intensity) for every wavelength. We can then construct a similar spectrum for a large region of the Sun, and obtain such spectra for each point. Now, if we consider the intensity at, let’s say 2796 Å for each point, we will get an image similar to the last panel in Fig. 1. How cool is that!4 You will now have many questions: why is the spectrum of individual elements only at specific wavelengths, and not everywhere? What conditions give rise to the brightness of these lines? First off, you find the spectrum of elements at discrete wavelength locations because these arise from atomic transitions between two approximately fixed energy levels. The quantum of Quantum mechanics gives rise to this discrete nature5. Next, the spectrum itself depends on, among other parameters, 4 critical properties: the temperature of the region where the spectrum is generated, density of the material giving rise to the spectrum, velocity of this material, and turbulence6. These properties, under certain circumstances, can be easily inferred from just the spectrum of an atom. First off, note that the material which emits this light is a fluid (more precisely, plasma) in our case. Hence, the temperature and density of the plasma determine if a given spectral line will even form. So just knowing the fact that a given line is seen tells us the possible range of values temperature and quantity can take. Next, the brightness of the line is in most cases dominated by the density of plasma – more density, more brightness, but you do have the effect of atomic physics and temperature. Third, the wavelength where we expect the line brightness to peak can be shifted to different wavelengths too! This is called Doppler shift. If the plasma is moving towards us, the shift is toward shorter wavelengths (called Blueshift), and if the plasma is moving away from us, the shift is toward longer wavelengths (called Redshifts)7.  Finally, if you see in Fig. 3, the line does not immediately peak at one wavelength. Rather, it starts to increase from one wavelength, reaches a maximum, and then reduces. This is called the line width, and is determined by the temperature, and turbulence in the plasma. Turbulence basically is a measure of how much fluctuation of different spatial sizes is present in the fluid - it is yet another measure of what the plasma we consider is like. So TLDR in summary, using spectral lines, we can get an estimate of local temperature, velocity, density and turbulence of these plasma parcels through spectral lines. So what is the big idea? The big idea is that some specific regions on the Sun are thought to give rise to a stream of particles called the solar wind. We know that these regions are important, but we don’t know at what height the solar wind starts to form. Now, the solar wind is basically a stream of particles coming out of the Sun. So if you are looking “down” on the Sun, you will see that the particles are coming towards you. This means the spectral line which the particles emit will be blueshifted. So the basic idea is that we study these Doppler shifts for plasma which correspond to different wavelengths (and so different heights and temperatures, like Fig. 1), and see where the blueshifts start! Now, these regions, which are thought to give rise to the solar wind, are called Coronal holes (CHs) - because they are seen as dark patches in the solar corona. In Fig. 4b below, all dark regions belong to CHs, while the brighter regions belong to Quiet Sun8 (QS). These regions appear very different in the solar corona. However, if we check what these regions look like at lower heights called the chromosphere, the differences are reduced (see Fig. 4a)! Why so? Has this “vanishing” of difference got anything to do with the solar wind? Can we do specific studies of these regions, and figure out what causes these differences? Are they dependent on the underlying magnetic field in any way? This was our primary objective of study. At this juncture, I should tell you that scientists have done extensive studies of the CHs and QS regions in the corona, and all of the information I have presented in the last two or so paragraphs was generated in the last three decades. So we do stand on the shoulders of other giants – while we do bring our own thought process to the table!  Fig. 4: An image of the CHs and surrounding QS region in the upper chromosphere (left panel) and the corona (right panel). The green lines demarcate CHs from QS in both the figures. Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2021 . Back to our work: we studied one spectral line (yep, just one line, and you will see how much information we can infer from it!), and its properties across both the CHs and QS regions. This line forms due to a transition of the C+ ion (called CII by astrophysicists) at a wavelength of 1334 Å. How do we know the correct wavelength? We can perform controlled experiments in labs on Earth and figure it out. Now, you have already seen how there is not a great difference between CH and QS in the intensity image of Fig. 4a. Similar results hold if we look at what the plasma velocity and line width are in Fig. 5. This tells us that if I were to not tell you where the CH and QS regions are, you cannot figure them out from either the intensity, velocity, or the width of the C II line. Thus, on a gross scale, the CH and QS are very similar! Interesting things happen if we account for the underlying magnetic field. How do we do this? We ask: what is the intensity in CH and QS at similar magnetic field strengths? Similarly, what are the velocities and line widths? The underlying magnetic field strength9 might be similar, but the structure of the magnetic field can be different! The structure of magnetic field (a. k. a magnetic topology) is important, because we know that the CHs are regions where the magnetic field comes out predominantly in open lines10, while in QS the same magnetic field comes as short closed loops. These differences are seen clearly in the corona – but are they also seen in the chromosphere?  Fig. 5: Velocity (left) and line width (right) of the C II line in CH and QS. The positive velocity is called “redshift” and tells how fast plasma is moving away from us, while the negative velocity is called “blueshift”, and tells how fast plasma is moving towards us. The larger line width means the line is broader, indicating larger turbulence effects and some non trivial effects. Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2021. Turns out it is the case! We can indeed differentiate between CH and QS if we consider regions with similar magnetic field strength. In Fig. 6, the black dots correspond to the average of quantity in Y-axis (Intensity, velocity, width) for regions with similar magnetic field strength (in X-axis). On an average, you see that the QS intensity is larger than the CH intensity in Fig. 6a – reminiscent of the differences in the corona, and seen statistically here. So one question is answered: CHs and QS are already differentiated in the chromosphere, but you can see this only statistically!11 Next, look at panel (b) of the same figure. The velocity is mostly positive - indicating plasma moving away from us, and down towards the photosphere. Thus, the chromosphere is, on average, flowing downwards into the Sun. However, it is interesting to see that at 40 Gauss, a switchover occurs: for less field strength, the QS has plasma flowing down faster, while it is CH for larger field strength. This is counter intuitive – if the solar wind comes out and towards us in the CH, why is plasma moving away from us in CH? Finally, see panel (c) of the same figure. The line width is seen to increase with field strength. This tells us that the profiles are getting broader, possibly implying larger turbulence with increasing field strength. Here too, CHs are broader than QS for large field strengths!  Fig. 6: Different properties of CH (black) and QS (orange) as a function of magnetic field strength (|B|). Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2021. Things don’t stop here. The velocity panel in Fig. 6b raises many questions. And so, we repeat the analysis with a tweak - this time, we consider the blueshifts and redshifts separately. Why so? This is important to understand if the field strength has preferentially some effect on the blueshifts and redshifts, which get averaged out in Fig. 6b. And so, we check what the speeds look like in Fig. 7. In panel (a) of Fig. 7, the CHs have larger blueshifts over QS, telling us plasma is indeed preferentially moving towards us in the CHs. Thus, in principle, these blueshifts could be a signature of the solar wind. Now we are in business! In panel (b), we check what the downflows look like. It seems for regions with large field strength, plasma is flowing into the Sun faster in CHs over QS. This was the signature which confused us in Fig. 6b. Why does the CH, which is understood to be a source of particles coming out towards the Earth, have particles going into the Sun, and away from the Earth preferentially? Are we doing something wrong? Or are the spectral profiles, and thus the process which generates these lines different in CHs and QS? Turns out it is not the case. I will not show the plot here (already there is an overdose of information – too much of a good thing is also not good! :P), but we find that the spectral profiles are very similar in both CH and QS. Thus, it tells us that the processes which give rise to these profiles are similar in both the regions – the differences are coming out only because of the differences in the magnetic field topology of CHs and QS!  Fig. 7: The velocity variation with magnetic field strength, for regions with only upflows (left) and only downflows (right) for CHs (black) and QS (orange). Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2021 . Thus, through this work, we find that the CHs and QS might appear similar overall, but the differentiation in chromosphere is seen clearly if we consider regions with similar magnetic field strength. This differentiation is seen clearly as less intensity and excess line width in CHs over QS. The differentiation is clearly seen to arise primarily due to the magnetic field topology, and not due to fundamental differences in the way these lines form. However, our work poses a bunch of fundamental questions: Why is plasma flowing faster away from us in CHs over QS, when these CHs are supposed to be the sources of solar wind? Does this “redshift” bear any relation to the solar wind? How do these results tie up with analysis done for lines which form at higher temperatures (and hence, in the transition region &amp; corona), and lower temperatures (lower &amp; mid chromosphere)? And do the blueshifts we find in Fig. 7b have any relation with the solar wind? To know more, and understand what happens next, keep watching this space!

The amount of X-rays given in hospitals do not cause any harm! &#8617;        This is an exercise for you - go look up why we see the Sun more yellow than green! &#8617;        To know more on why this is the case, refer to my other article on the coronal heating problem! &#8617;        As we will see later, plasma flowing up or down will change this location! &#8617;        Check out this cool reference for more information.  &#8617;        Technically I should call it “non-thermal effect”, and it may result due to various reasons.

Remember, we cannot have truly open fields since magnetic monopoles do not exist! &#8617;        Note that this question was also answered by Pradeep Kayshap et al 2018 for the Mg II line, which also forms in the chromosphere.  &#8617;    "

    "title": "Astrobiology: Exploring the universe for signs of extra-terrestrial life",
    "body": "2022/02/20 -  The only life forms we know about are the ones that exist on Earth. Due to advancements in space exploration, it has become possible to send rovers, probes, space crafts, and telescopes in further deep space. With the help of these space missions and various other tools, astrobiologists are trying to find signatures of life on other planets, exoplanets, and various moons.  1. 	Introduction: Is life a cosmic phenomenon?Are we alone in the universe? All of us have wondered about it at some point in our lives. Perhaps only a few would have wondered about what exactly is life. This might sound philosophical at first but it is equally scientific. Astrobiology tries to find answers to all these questions. It is the science that seeks to understand the story of life in the universe. We have not found explicit evidence of life so far but with unceasing curiosity and an inherent urge for exploration, scientists have discovered a lot. Being a multidisciplinary field, Astrobiology brings people with diverse backgrounds together to achieve a common goal – the search for life beyond Earth and beyond the solar system. The origin of life on Earth is a great mystery and therefore scientists are investigating the problem in several different ways.  Some are studying life on our own planet. Some are seeking out life or fossil life on other planets or moons in our solar system. Others are trying to detect life in other solar systems, either by measuring life’s effects on the atmospheres of distant planets or by measuring artificial radiation like radio signals that may be produced by advanced life. 2. 	Life on Earth: We only know the nature of life as it exists on Earth. It is built around compounds that contain elements such as carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen. Complex sequences of these elements bond together, forming the very building blocks of life. They form essential organic molecules, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). However, these organic molecules did not naturally exist on Earth during the Hadean eon (4. 0 billion years ago and preceding the existence life forms). The elements required existed only in inorganic form, bound up within the rocks, atmosphere and the early ocean. It is estimated that life on Earth began at least 3. 5 billion years ago, because that is the age of the oldest rocks with fossil evidence of life on Earth. Researchers suggest that in order to understand how life began on Earth, we need to understand the specific environmental conditions and other requirements that must be satisfied to allow this to occur. What are the habitability requirements of known Earth life? The fundamental habitability requirements are certainly some of the commonalities of life on Earth. •	Energy:A source of energy is necessary for metabolism and to maintain the functions carried out by a cell. Life on Earth uses either solar energy or chemical energy sources that include both organic (carbon) compounds and inorganic elements and molecules. •	Common essential elements:All known Earth life uses the same main set of elements to form biomolecules (CHNOPS) and shares a common carbon-based biochemistry. Carbon is an excellent element from which to build life, because carbon forms macromolecules with a variety of other elements and itself. Carbon forms primarily covalent bonds (compared to ionic bonds), and carbon-based molecules are stable in the presence of water and oxygen. •	Solvent:A solvent to host chemical interactions is considered a universal requirement for all life. With extensive evidence that all Earth life needs water specifically as the solvent, many astrobiologists consider water to be the most probable solvent for life. When considering whether an environment or planet is habitable, at a minimum, scientists take into account the potential energy source (or sources), the ambient chemical composition and whether this composition is suitable to build biomass, and the availability of a solvent. Additionally, there are physical constraints upon life (e. g. , temperature, pressure, pH, salinity, radiation, metal toxicity) such that the presence of these habitability requirements may be necessary but not sufficient for life. 2. 1 Life on Earth is divided into three domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya (or Eucarya); Single-celled organisms are common in all three domains, and all organisms in the domains Archaea and Bacteria are single-celled. All multicellular organisms fall within the domain Eukarya. The term ‘‘prokaryotes’’ has traditionally been used to describe single-celled organisms that do not contain a nucleus, organelles, or a cytoskeleton (collectively, the domains Bacteria and Archaea). The majority of life on Earth is microbial, and astrobiologists extrapolate from that fact to conclude that the majority of any extraterrestrial life that may possibly exist is also likely to be microbial. Archaea and Bacteria are the focus of astrobiological studies due to the diversity of metabolic strategies utilized by them and their ability to thrive in extreme habitats, their pivotal role in Earth’s biogeochemical cycling, and the fact that single-celled organisms dominated the early history of life on Earth. Bacteria and Archaea harbour the vast majority of the genetic diversity of life on Earth. Scientists estimate that, to date, less than 1% of microbial life has been successfully cultivated (e. g. , grown in the laboratory). Therefore, molecular methods that do not require cultivation are also used to detect the presence and genetic capabilities of microbes through DNA (metagenomics), RNA and gene expression activity (metatranscriptomics), and transcribed proteins (metaproteomics). These techniques have demonstrated that microbial populations are highly complex and that we have only begun to elucidate the full extent and capabilities of microbial life.   Image 1: A phylogenetic tree based on rRNA data, emphasizing the separation of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, as proposed by Carl Woese, George E. Fox et al. in 1990. Image source: Carl Woese et al. (1990) 2. 2 Prevalence of life in extreme environments: When space agencies first began to explore the Solar System, scientists were not sure what they would find on the surfaces of planets like Mars and Venus. When space missions revealed Mars to be a frigid desert, and Venus a boiling cauldron, void of any obvious signs of life, astrobiologists began to wonder… what are the limits of habitability for life as we know it? How hot is too hot? How cold is too cold? How much acid can cells handle, and how little water can life survive on? Answering questions like these opened an entire field of study known as extremophile research, where scientists examine the adaptations of organisms in conditions that are considered ‘extreme’ for life on Earth. These hardy lifeforms can help us better understand how life as we know it might originate, evolve, and reproduce in harsh environments in the Solar System and beyond. On a tour of extreme environments on Earth, a good place to start is with terrestrial hot springs. Good examples include Yellowstone National park in the United States, Rotorua in New Zealand and Puga hot spring in Ladakh, India These environments were the first to draw the interest of astrobiologists that study the limits of life on Earth, and they are arguably the first environment in which an extremophile, Thermus aquaticus was isolated and documented by scientists.   Image 2: Aerial view of Grand Prismatic Spring; Hot Springs, Midway &amp; Lower Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park. Image courtesy: Jim Peaco, National Park Service These springs are where geothermally heated water from underground rises to the planet’s surface. They can act as a source of water, energy, and nutrients for living cells. The water boiling up from below can carry a wide variety of minerals and reduced chemical species that certain microbes can use as a source of energy. Microorganisms have been found here living in pools of up to 206 degrees Fahrenheit (97ºC). The composition of the water depends on many different factors, such as its source and the types of rock and soil it travels through. It’s not just the heat that challenges life’s survival in hot springs. Some springs have water that is very acidic, others have water that is extremely alkaline. Gases at concentrations poisonous to humans, and other animals, bubble up with the water. The rock and liquid can contain heavy metals like arsenic and lead, along with lots of other minerals and particulates. Some pools can be extremely salty, and are rich in potassium and sulphate. High temperatures also mean less dissolved oxygen, so many hydrothermal pools are low in oxygen content. The multitude of harsh conditions present in terrestrial hot springs also means that it isn’t only thermophiles that live in these environments. There are acidophiles, alkaliphiles, and many other types of organisms. Sometimes scientists find extremophiles that use multiple adaptations to survive (polyextremophiles). On Earth, wherever we find liquid water, we find life, whether in bubbling hot springs, drops of brine inside ice, or films of water around minerals deep in the crust. Up until 1977, scientists believed that all life on Earth was in some way dependent upon sunlight for energy. The discovery of hydrothermal vents showed that life could thrive independent of the Sun. Suddenly, scientists had an Earthly example of how life might survive on ocean worlds in the outer Solar System, such as Jupiter’s moon Europa, or Saturn’s moon Enceladus. These moons are thought to harbor oceans of dark, liquid water beneath their icy surfaces. If hydrothermal vents are present, those oceans could be habitable for life as we know it. 2. 3	How do we search for signs of life beyond Earth? Astrobiological exploration is founded upon the premise that biosignatures encountered in space will be recognizable as presence of extraterrestrial life. A biosignature is any substance – such as an element, isotope, or molecule – or phenomenon that provides scientific evidence of past or present life. The usefulness of a biosignature is determined not only by the probability of life creating it but also by the improbability of non-biological (abiotic) processes producing it. Concluding that evidence of an extraterrestrial life form (past or present) has been discovered requires proving that a possible biosignature was produced by the activities or remains of life. As with most scientific discoveries, discovery of a biosignature will require evidence building up until no other explanation exists. Thus, we can look for atmospheric gases such as oxygen or methane that can be produced by life. Such planetary features that indicate life are biosignatures. The simultaneous presence of oxygen and methane is evidence for life because these two gases should quickly react with each other unless a biosphere is producing great amounts of them, which prevents equilibrium. Microbial life will readily consume hydrogen or carbon monoxide gas, so an abundance of either of these might be considered an anti-biosignature for a planet in the habitable zone. Eg. The presence of methane in the atmosphere of Mars is an area of ongoing research. Because of its tendency to be destroyed in the atmosphere by photochemistry, the presence of excess methane on a planet can be an indication that there must be an active source. With life being the strongest source of methane on Earth, observing a disequilibrium in the methane abundance on another planet could be a viable biosignature.   Image 3: This illustration portrays possible ways that methane might be added to Mars' atmosphere (sources) and removed from the atmosphere (sinks). NASA's Curiosity Mars rover has detected fluctuations in methane concentration in the atmosphere. Image courtesy: NASA/JPL-Caltech 3. 	Habitability in the solar system: After Earth it is absolutely logical to explore habitability of planets in our solar system. Planet Mars, in the inner solar system is a potential candidate to search for life beyond Earth. Simultaneously, moon of Jupiter (Europa) and moons of Saturn (Titan and Enceladus) in the outer solar system are also promising and extensive research is currently being conducted. The type of life that we are considering is simple, comparable to microbes, and the guiding principle concerns liquid water. 3. 1 Mars:Many have imagined Mars, unlike Venus, as a potential abode for life. The atmosphere of Mars is much thinner than Earth’s. The Red Planet’s atmosphere contains more than 95% carbon dioxide and much less than 1% oxygen. Temperatures on Mars average about -81 degrees F. However, temperature’s range from around -220 degrees F in the wintertime at the poles, to +70 degrees F over the lower latitudes in the summer. Mars Global Surveyor, which orbited from 1997 to 2006, mapped Mars and imaged sedimentary layers that implied many geologic cycles of erosion and deposition. In the early 21st century, the Mars Odyssey and Mars Express orbiters, along with Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, discovered areas of clay minerals and salts, which may have formed in liquid water. Twin Mars Exploration Rovers landed in 2004, and found fossilized ripples from past liquid water and sedimentary rocks, while in 2008, NASA’s Phoenix Lander dug up subsurface ice in a polar region and measured soluble salts in the soil. Finally, in 2012, Curiosity Rover trundled towards a 5-kilometre-high mountain of sedimentary beds within a 150- kilometre-diameter crater named Gale. It found mudstones deposited from water. Nowadays, astrobiological interest in Mars concerns either biological traces from billions of years ago or microbial-like life that might possibly endure in the subsurface or underground.   Image 4: Curiosity rover on a Martian sand dune. Image courtesy: NASA Mars’s current surface is hostile to life for three reasons. First, while ice exists for sure, no liquid water has been identified. The polar caps are water ice, topped with carbon dioxide ‘dry ice’ that grows when about 30 per cent of the atmosphere freezes at the winter pole. Also, above mid latitudes, ice cemented soil or permafrost lies just beneath the surface. In the tropics, afternoon temperatures in the top centimetre of soil rise above freezing, but there, ice turns to vapour before melting temperatures are reached. A second problem is no ozone layer, allowing harmful ultraviolet sunlight to reach the surface. Third, chemical reactions in the atmosphere make hydrogen peroxide— which settles to the surface, where they can destroy organics. While the surface is unpromising, geothermal heat underground might allow liquid water and life to exist. Evidence that liquid water used to be present suggests that Mars was once more habitable than today. Fluvial (stream-related) features in the landscape, including gullies, dried-up river valleys, deltas, and enormous channels are also indicative of the same. Moreover, the soil and rocks contain minerals that form in the presence of liquid water. 3. 2 Jovian moon Europa The Galileo mission detected an induced magnetic field in Europa (a moon of Jupiter), providing compelling evidence for an ocean of liquid water beneath the surface. While the top surface of Europa is not habitable, it is still relevant to discuss here for several reasons: (1) surface materials may reflect the chemistry of a subsurface ocean and help us understand the conditions available to life there, and (2) materials brought to the surface from the ocean below may be the only way we can detect signs of life (e. g. , organic matter or other biosignatures characterized spectroscopically on a future mission). Radiation from high-energy particles caught in Jupiter’s magnetic field causes oxidation of surface materials as the energy from radiation knocks electrons out of atoms. Radiolytically produced oxidants at the surface include O2, SO2, H2O2, and CO2. These may be subsequently cycled into the ice shell and ocean on timescales on the order of the age of the surface, 106 years, which is quite young on geological timescales, so these compounds could potentially oxidize more reduced chemical species in the ocean below.   Image5 : Europa, a jovian moon. Image courtesy: NASA 3. 3 Icy moons of Saturn : 3. 3. 1 Enceladus :Enceladus is Saturn’s sixth largest moon and has active geology. In 2005, the spacecraft Cassini started multiple close flybys of Enceladus, revealing its surface and environment in greater detail. It orbits Saturn in an elliptical fashion resulting in varying gravitational forces from Saturn that flex and heat Enceladus. For reasons that are not fully understood, the heating is concentrated under Enceladus’ South pole. There, icy particles and gas spray out of parallel fractures dubbed tiger stripes. The jets contain traces of methane, ammonia, and organic compounds, along with salt. Enceladus has a rocky core, an icy shell, and an underground sea beneath the area of the jets. The jackpot combination of organic molecules, energy, and liquid water implies that life might exist.   Image 6 : Narrow jets of gas and icy particles erupt from the south polar region of Enceladus, contributing to the moon's giant plume. A cycle of activity in these small-scale jets may be periodically lofting extra particles into space, causing the overall plume to brighten dramatically. Image courtesy: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute 3. 3. 2 Titan :Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, is also of astrobiological interest because it is the only satellite in the Solar System to have a thick atmosphere. In fact, the air pressure at Titan’s surface is 1. 5 bar, which is 50 per cent larger than that at the Earth’s surface. The atmosphere of 95 per cent nitrogen and 5 per cent methane provides a 10°C greenhouse effect, but the sunlight at Saturn’s distance is one hundred times less intense than at Earth, so Titan’s surface is incredibly cold at –179°C.   Image 7 : NASA's Cassini spacecraft sees bright methane clouds drifting in the summer skies of Saturn's moon Titan, along with dark hydrocarbon lakes and seas clustered around the north pole. Image courtesy: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute Titan’s atmosphere contains a smoggy haze of hydrocarbons. At high altitude, ultraviolet sunlight breaks up methane molecules (CH4) and subsequent reactions build up hydrocarbons including ethane (C2H6), acetylene (C2H2), propane (C3H8), benzene (C6H6), and reddish-brown particles containing polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The particles are called tholins. The products derived from methane sediment out of the atmosphere. In fact, about 20 per cent of Titan’s surface is covered in tropical dunes that are made of sand-sized particles, which are at least coated with organics if not made of them. At the poles, over 400 lakes are mixtures of liquid propane, ethane, and methane, with extraordinary beaches made of particles of benzene and acetylene. Methane on Titan behaves like water on Earth and forms clouds, rain, and rivers. Most of our knowledge about Titan comes from the Cassini–Huygens mission, which arrived in 2004. Huygens landed on Titan in 2005. Titan flexes too much to be entirely solid, which is evidence that Titan has a subsurface ocean which might exist below an icy crust. Two types of life might exist on Titan: Earth-like life in the subsurface ocean; and non-DNA based life or life which has a different biochemistry in the hydrocarbon lakes. 4. 	Habitability beyond solar system : Finding exoplanets is crucial before identifying a habitable one. With the vast distances involved, the search is difficult but nonetheless astronomers have developed two classes of methods. The first, indirect detection, looks for stellar properties, such as position or brightness, which are affected by the presence of unseen planets. The second is direct detection of a planet with an image or a spectrum of its light. For astrobiology, the most important techniques are direct detections that capture light from a planet. Direct detection is challenging because a planet is a dim body close to a vastly brighter star. Nonetheless, telescopes in space, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Telescopes and extremely large telescopes on the ground have accomplished direct detection using a coronagraph, which is a mask to block the starlight. With density measurements, there are increasing clues about which exoplanets are made of gas, rock, water, or some mixture. We care most about exoplanets with liquid water right at the surface. These have the chance of a biosphere that pumps lots of gases into an atmosphere. In principle, such biogenic gases are detectable in the light from the planet and might indicate life. If a planet is too far away from its host star it ices over, and if it’s too close it’s too hot for liquid water. The term habitable zone (HZ) refers to the region around a star in which an Earth-like planet could maintain liquid water on its surface at some instant in time. We specify a particular time because stars age and brighten or dim, so the HZ moves. The closest star to Earth is a triple-star system called Alpha Centauri which is at a 4. 25 – 4. 35 light years distance. The list of potentially habitable exoplanets is mostly based on estimates of habitability by the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog (HEC), and data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. The HEC is maintained by the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. Surface planetary habitability is thought to require orbiting at the right distance from the host star for liquid surface water to be present, in addition to various geophysical and geodynamical aspects, atmospheric density, radiation type and intensity, and the host star’s plasma environment. 5. 	Conclusion : Astrobiology is intriguing and challenging at the same time. Research done on origin of life and extremophiles is used to extrapolate to other planets and various moons in the solar system. Astrobiologists are primarily interested in the subsurface water oceans of these planets. Overall, follow the water has been the motto. All space agencies keep executing ambitious space missions probes, rovers, spacecrafts, telescopes, etc. Another aspect of Astrobiology which pushes science boundaries is exoplanet search. Habitable planets beyond our solar system are actively being sought after. Bio-signatures help us detect presence of Earth-like life in our solar system and beyond it. With the advancement in technology for space exploration one can expect that humans will exist as a multiplanetary species in future. There is a possibility that we are alone in the universe or who knows we might find life elsewhere. Till then let’s keep our fingers crossed. 6. 	References :  NASA Astrobiology Primer v2. 0 Shawn D.

    "title": "A list of scholarships for women in Science",
    "body": "2022/02/10 - A significant fraction of the advances in science and technology arises due to seminal contributions by women - all the while tackling a series of battles against social norms and skewed opportunities. Even today, there exists a lack of representation of women in higher education, scientific research and industry. For instance, women make up almost 43% of STEM (i. e. Science Technology Engineering and Medicine) graduates in the country, but just 14% scientists and engineers in universities/institutions. A “leaky STEM pipeline” is formed as only 3-6% of women enroll for a PhD in STEM. Even though many injustices exist as hurdles to women empowerment, various governments and organizations have come forward in combating these issues. One of the most effective ways to empower women is through education. An educated woman has the capability, knowledge and independence to take up various avenues in life independently - especially in STEM. Education starts not just at a very specialized stage, but right from primary school – where children are instilled with the dreams of exploring the edge of the universe to breaking open the smallest of particles. Poverty, the unfortunate condition that plagues a large part of our country is especially detrimental to the education of girls. Hence, in this article, we present our humble attempt at compiling a set of scholarships which are aimed at covering the education costs of girls. We have presented the scholarship data in three groups - school education, undergraduate studies, and post graduation. For each group we have presented the eligibility criteria and the scholarship amount in multiple columns, while we have linked the homepage of each scholarship for more information. We do not claim this to be an exhaustive list - in fact, this will be a “living” document which shall get updated as and when we get more information. If you, the reader, think we have missed an important scholarship scheme, please give us a shout out through the comments section below, or by contacting us directly through the form.

    "title": "Mendeley Reference Manager",
    "body": "2022/02/10 -  Being involved in research means dealing with a lot of papers on a day to day basis. Be it reading them, organizing them, or referencing them we often face a perilous task. A collection of scores of pdf documents scattered here and there in multiple folders is not something unheard of. Often we spend a lot of time looking for a particular part of the text from a paper but unable to locate it. While writing papers, and searching for references I’ve seen a lot of people doing it manually which is a waste of precious research time.  Thanks to the advances in software in the past years, we have a tool which can do it all for us, saving a lot of time and energy as well. It is ‘MENDELEY’ offered by Elsevier.  Mendeley is a library manager which can store and arrange all the pdf documents we put into it. A very informative guide is available on the official website. ​My first interaction with Mendeley was when I was doing research work related to my dissertation as a part of the M Sc. course. The scholars in that lab were pretty much using Mendeley on a day-to-day basis and from there I picked up the idea of organizing papers nicely into a library interface. It is a versatile software available for almost all desktop and mobile systems. As we use Debian based Linux for our research, there is a . deb package available on the website. There is an app on the android app store as well which can be pretty helpful in organizing the research papers. The Mendeley website offers a web library interface that is not very different from the one we have on the desktop. Apart from that, browser extensions are available for both Chrome and Firefox browsers which can be used to save the articles we open in the browser to be directly saved to the web library. In fact, the experience is extremely seamless, one can read a document on her laptop and highlight some text and can continue with the same point at her desktop at a later time. No need to waste time searching for that one particular paragraph from scores of papers put in unlimited folders. The sync works perfectly fine across all devices. One can also assign a folder in which Mendeley will automatically look for papers once the application starts. Of course, everything syncs to the web library eventually. One has to create a single Mendeley account for all the devices preferably over the website and then use the same login credentials for every device. After that the installation is pretty simple, just follow the steps in a logical fashion and within a few seconds, you’ll have your own library waiting for the papers to put it. Then there are a few ways in which the papers could be added:  Using the Chrome and Firefox browser extensions, just click on save once you come across a paper, and it’ll be dropped into your library.  Add a watch folder, and Mendeley will automatically look for files in that folder.  Add files/folders manually using a point and click interface. The documents will then be uploaded to your Mendeley account online. So once the library is set up and we have a collection of papers, the first thing to notice is that it can automatically sort and arrange the papers based on author name, title, publication year, journal name, etc. For incomplete references, Mendeley offers to search the database using the arXiv IDs or DOIs which maybe available in the document metadata. All the files are stored locally as well as synced with the cloud library. One can also create groups to keep the papers more organized. A pdf reader is built in the Mendeley package. It is a versatile pdf reader with annotation capabilities. One can mark, highlight, add comments at any point in the document. Besides the library offers a fully searchable interface meaning one can look for the exact phrase or line in a collection of 1000 papers! Imagine doing that manually. Although the basic edition is free to use, there is a limitation of 2GB storage per account. The pricing is pretty simple 5GB will cost you approximately $55/year and $165/year for unlimited storage. For me, the free edition suffices the need for now. Let’s see what happens in the future. Ever since I installed this application on my desktop, I guess I have saved a lot of time. There is no need to look for papers through my file explorer or terminal. If I have to search for a particular text snippet, I just put that in my Mendeley search bar and it searches for the same in all the papers and of course, it makes life easy. Apart from that, the inbuild BibTeX means I don’t need to run here and there for references for my texts as Mendeley can easily export all the references in BibTeX format. If I come across a nice paper, or during the arXiv search something catches my attention, it goes straight to my library within a few seconds using the Chrome extension. While writing drafts, the automatically exported . bib file is hassle-free for the bibliography. Some web links including tutorials for Mendeley are listed below:  https://www. mendeley. com/guides https://alliant. libguides. com/c. php?g=692700&amp;p=4908245 https://guides. lib. berkeley. edu/mendeley/libraryPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

    "body": "2022/02/10 - Progress is possible only when everyone capable of contributing is given an equal chance irrespective of gender, community and nationality. While there is a long way to go before this gap is fulfilled, it should be noted that we as a community have made considerable strides in meeting this agenda. Even at the dawn of independence, the majority of women were not even given a chance to study but now, in 70 years, we can happily say that women are not only earning degrees and doctorates but actively leading the world on major scientific, technological and industrial fronts! The science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in India, as is in every other country, have an unequal gender work environment. In this regard, the United Nations General Assembly has declared February 11 as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science to inspire and engage women and girls in STEM, with the hope that more girls take up science and research as a career. While the number of women in science and technology is less, their contributions are not! In order to celebrate their contributions, we at CosmicVarta have collated a list of books that commemorate the immense contribution that women across the world have made to science with an intention to inspire and arouse a scientific temper in the reader. These books show us how these trailblazers, pioneers and path-breakers’ lives were and what inspired them to become scientists!

    "title": "Mass of the Black Hole in the nearby AGN: Mrk 590",
    "body": "2022/02/08 -  Most of the massive galaxies in the Universe host a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at their center. A minority among them are known as active galaxies and host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). These AGN are believed to be powered by the accretion of matter onto the SMBH and the emission from such accreting systems can have important effects on the host galaxy.  The central regions of such AGN are so compact to be spatially resolved by any current imaging techniques, with the exception of the broad-line region (BLR) being resolved in two nearby AGN using recent interferometric observations carried out on the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory. The angular size of the majority of the AGN is so small to be resolved using existing interferometric facilities. Therefore, alternative methods are needed to probe the central regions of AGN. One such technique is reverberation mapping, where time resolution is used as a proxy for spatial resolution.  This technique allows one to determine the mass of the SMBH, the extent of the BLR, and the dusty torus that surrounds the SMBH. This technique works on the principle of measuring the time delay between the flux variations in an ionizing source and the flux variations from the surrounding regions irradiated by the central ionization source.  Implementation of this method to find the extent of the BLR and subsequently measure the SMBH mass is usually carried out by spectroscopic monitoring observations which is not only a tedious process but also consumes an enormous amount of telescope time.   Figure 1: Subaru spectrum of Mrk 590. The broad B, R and narrow Hα and S II filters are also over-plotted. Image source : arXiv:2110. 02055 An alternative to spectroscopic monitoring observations is the method of photometric reverberation which is simple and cheap in terms of observing time. This method relies on photometric monitoring observations of the AGN through suitably selected narrow-band filters to catch the redshifted emission line response, while another filter (either narrow band or broad band) is required to trace the continuum flux . A recent work titled: Changing look AGN Mrk 590: Broad-line region and black hole mass from photometric reverberation mapping led by Amit Kumar Mandal has used the technique of photometric reverberation mapping to find the extent of the BLR in a nearby AGN, Mrk 590, located at a redshift (z) =0. 026, where the SII narrowband filter is able to monitor the Hα emission line. A few active galaxies are found to undergo a transition from Type 1 characterized by strong emission lines, to Type 1. 8 or 1. 9, with weak or no broad emission lines, or vice versa. These galaxies are known as changing look AGN. Mrk 590 is such a changing look AGN.  Figure 2: The BLR size- luminosity relation for Mrk 590 (red star) in this study. Also plotted is the same relation for all other objects whose BLR sizes are available through previous reverberation mapping campaigns. Image source : arXiv:2110. 02055 From photometric observations carried out during July to December 2018, using a moderate size 60 cm robotic telescope located at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, the research group was able to find the radius of the BLR of Mrk 590 to be 21. 44+1. 49-2. 11 days. Using this lag, and an optical spectrum of the source obtained with the 8. 2 m Subaru Telescope, the research led by Dr. Amit Kumar Mandal was able to measure the mass of the SMBH in Mrk 590 as 1. 96+0. 15-0. 21x 108 M ⦿, where M ⦿ is the mass of the Sun.

    "title": "Measuring the ages of the Earth and Moon ",
    "body": "2022/02/05 -  A popular article exploring how the ages of the Earth and Moon were measured. Introduction: Scientists present their evidence in the form of a measurement. People make many statements in everyday life. Some are qualitative and some are quantitative. In science, we try to deal only with statements that can be quantified. Otherwise, we would have no way to compare results.  Scientists use measurements to arrive at precise and quantitative statements. Mathematics is the tool through which scientists study such topics like quantity. Regarded as the language of nature, mathematics has acted as the most essential weapon in almost every known field, including natural science, engineering, medicine, finance, and the social sciences. Earth’s age: the quest begins: During any cloudless night, if you go away from the city in a place free from light pollution and if you look up towards the night sky, you will be mesmerized by a spectacular sight of thousands of stars dazzling in the sky. Naturally various questions will come to your mind like: Who created this Universe? How and why did it begin? What is the fate of the Universe? Who are we? How we came from? Are we alone in this Universe? Twinkling like diamonds, the beauty of the night sky has indeed captured the imagination of human minds since prehistoric times. Curious by nature, since our first awakening, Homo sapiens or humans have been asking these questions.  This natural curiosity of humanity gave rise to science. If one looks at the long march of human understanding, one will find that science begins with the idea that we can understand our role in the universe using logic and observation. The stars and planets were mysterious objects for most of human history. Yet ancient Greek philosophers were able to use reasoned arguments and simple geometry to estimate the sizes and distances of our neighbors in space. Similarly, the most important scientific step in understanding Earth’s history was not one particular set of measurements, but rather the mental leap of realizing that Earth had a history that could be unraveled by scientific observations and measurements. This happened mostly in the 16th and 17th centuries with the Renaissance and then with a period of time called the Enlightenment. One example of how science works is humanity’s long, step-by-step search to find the age of the Earth. By studying the Earth and the Moon, scientists have been able to piece together their linked histories. In the Middle Ages, scholars thought they could calculate Earth’s age by finding out how long humans had lived on Earth. They assumed that humanity had been around almost since Earth itself formed. Therefore, scholars analyzed ancient records, especially Biblical scriptures that listed the generations since Adam and Eve. They concluded that humanity, Earth, and the whole cosmos were only a few thousand years old. The most famous calculation was made by Irish Archbishop James Ussher in 1650. Ussher deduced that the cosmos formed on Sunday, October 23, in 4004 B. C. , and that humanity was created on Friday, October 28 the same year.  Even today, some people — especially fundamentalist religious groups — still believe that the Earth is only a few thousand years old, based on this method of reasoning.   James Ussher, the person who first deduced that Earth was formed in 4004 B. C. Image credit: Wikimedia commons.  Then, gradually evidence mounted during the 19th century that the Earth was far older than previously believed. Presently we know with reasonable confidence that our planet and its only satellite, the Moon, are a double system that formed around 460 crore (i. e. 4. 6 billion) years ago.  The Moon probably originated during a gigantic collision in the late stages of planetary formation, after the Earth’s iron core formed. But, which weapon helps us to probe the age of the Earth and Moon? How can we tell the age of so confidently? Here comes the role of mathematics. Yes, mathematics equipped with brilliant minds of scientists became the invincible tool which ultimately revealed the age of our planet and its neighbour. Without mentioning the detail history of how this feat was achieved, I shall now discuss the mathematical technique which we use to measure the ages of our Earth, any rock, fossil or even any old architechtural artifacts. Radioactive decay process: The age of the Earth-Moon system and the chronology of the Earth’s history are measured using the technique of radioactive decay. This well-understood physical process also provides the energy that drives most of the Earth’s geological evolution. In the late 1800s, the crucial discovery of radioactivity made possible even more accurate estimates of the Earth’s age. The process is worth discussing in detail since it allows us to date not only Earth but also rock samples from other worlds, such as lunar rocks and meteorites. The discovery of radioactivity happened by accident. In 1896 French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel left some photographic plates in a drawer with some uranium-bearing minerals. Later he opened the drawer and found the plates fogged. Being a good scientist, he did not dismiss the event but investigated further. He found that the uranium emitted “rays,” which, like X-rays (discovered the previous year), could pass through cardboard. The new “rays” turned out to be not electromagnetic radiation, like ultraviolet light or X-rays, but rather energetic particles emitted by unstable atoms.   Alpha decay is one example type of radioactive decay, in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle, and thereby transforms (or 'decays') into an atom with a mass number 4 less and atomic number 2 less. Image credit: Wikimedia commons.  Here is how radioactivity works. A radioactive atom is an unstable atom that spontaneously changes (usually into a more stable form) by emitting one or more particles from its nucleus. The original atom thus becomes either a new element (change in the number of protons in the nucleus) or a new form of the same element, called an isotope (change in the number of neutrons in the nucleus). The original atom is called the parent isotope and the new atom is called the daughter isotope. The time required for half of the atoms of any original radioactive parent isotope to decay into daughter isotopes is called the half-life of the radioactive element. If a billion atoms of a parent isotope were present in a certain mineral specimen, a half billion would be left after one half-life, a quarter billion after the second half-life, and so on. Sometimes the result of the decay is another radioactive element, so the decay continues. But in every case, the final product of the decay (or chain of decays) is a stable element. For example, carbon-14 decays to nitrogen-14 with a halflife of only 5,570 years. Likewise, uranium-238 decays (in a series of steps) to lead-206 with a half-life of 4. 5 billion (1 billion = 100 crore) years. Radioactivity is a random process. This means that the exact time when an individual atom decays is impossible to determine. Yet the average time for half of a very large number of atoms to decay is well determined. Radioactive Half-Life: Using the general principles of radioactive decay, scientists have developed a simple equation to calculate a rock’s age. Let us examine how a scientist might use these principles to develop such an equation. Our goal is to give the age of a rock sample in terms of the number of atoms that have decayed. Suppose a radioactive isotope has a half-life of 1 million (1 million = 10 lakhs)years. A certain number of these atoms are trapped in a crystal as molten lava cools to form a rock. After 1 million years, half of them would be left. After 2 million years, half of that amount would be left. This would be ½ × ½ = ¼ of the original number. How many would be left after 3 half-lives, or 3 million years? It would half that number again, or ½ × ½ × ½ = ⅛. From the progression of half-lives, it is easy to see how to convert from this specific description to a formula for the general case. Let’s define the fraction of the atoms that are left as F. Suppose that we wait N half-lives, and ask how many atoms would be left. Based on the paragraph above, we see that the answer would be: F = N/2 To make the same equation even more useful if you have a calculator, we can take the logarithm of both sides (base 10 logarithm), which gives: log F = N log (1/2) = -0. 301 N We can check this result. From the discussion above, we know that when N = 3 half-lives, the fraction of atoms left is 1/8. Substituting N = 3, we get log F = -0. 903. A calculator confirms F = 0. 125, or 1/8. Suppose we want to determine the age of a rock crystal and its potassium atoms. A particular radioactive form of potassium decays with a half-life of 1. 25 billion years (known to 3 significant digits), yielding a certain form of argon atoms. Suppose we measure the argon and potassium in the rock crystal, and we find that 58% of the radioactive potassium has already decayed into argon, while 42% of the original radioactive potassium atoms are left in the crystal.  How old is the rock? Our measurement has told us that F is 0. 42, and so our equation gives - 0. 376 = -0. 301 N. Thus, N = 1. 25 half-lives. That would mean that the rock is 1. 62 billion years old. Ages of the Earth and Moon: Understanding the age of the Earth was more difficult than early scientists imagined. The answer couldn’t be found by counting generations of humans. The answer couldn’t be found by measuring sedimentary layers. It wasn’t until radioactive decay processes started to be understood in the 1890s that people could begin to get an accurate measure of the age of both the Earth and the Moon. How did scientists pin down the ages of the Earth and the Moon? Using radioactive dating of rocks, we can measure the time since the rock was last melted. When rocks form from molten material, parent (and forming daughter) isotopes get locked into a single location. Prior to the rock’s formation, the products of radioactive decays could escape (for instance in the mixing of liquid lava). Once the rock solidifies, decays happen in situ. By knowing the rate of decay processes, and measuring the ratio of parent and daughter isotopes, it’s possible to place constraints on the age of a rock. Armed with the technique of radioactive dating, geologists set out to find the oldest rocks on Earth. These oldest rocks are very rare because, after billions of years, most have been destroyed by the Earth’s active geology. The oldest regions of unaltered crust are in Greenland, Western Australia, and South Africa, and they are about 3. 9 to 4. 0 billion years old. In one remarkable discovery from the Jack Hills region of Western Australia, a small zircon crystal was found with a radiometric age of 4. 404 billion years. Think of it - a mineral smaller than the head of a nail that tells us about billions of years of history! We have to add to this age an uncertain number representing the time the Earth was molten and the surface was being heavily bombarded by Solar System debris. An upper bound to the age of the Earth comes from the most primitive meteorite materials, which are inclusions rich in calcium and aluminum. This measured age of the Solar System is 4. 567 billion years. The best estimate for the total age of the Earth is 4. 54 billion years with an uncertainty of only 1%.   Lunar Olivine Basalt 15555 sample collected from the Moon by the Apollo 15 mission. It was formed around 330 crore (or 3. 3 billion years ago. It is on display in the National Museum of Natural History of USA. Image credit: Wikimedia commons.  To verify this number, scientists also wanted to date lunar rocks to see if they were comparable in age to the Earth. Each Apollo mission brought back a precious cargo of lunar rocks, soil samples, and drill cores. Together with some smaller samples brought back by earlier, unmanned Soviet probes, scientists gathered several hundred kilograms of rocks from nine different lunar sites. Lunar scientists eagerly tested these samples and began to unravel the history of the Moon.  Many of the rocks were in the range of 3 to 4 billion years old, with a few chips dating back to 4. 4 or 4. 5 billion years ago. Apparently, most rocks from the first few hundred million years of the Moon’s history were pulverized and destroyed by the intense bombardment that occurred at that time, which is why the earliest rocks and chips are rare. Scientists add about 100 million years to this age for the time it took the molten Moon to solidify. The best estimate of the age of the Moon from radiometric dating is 4. 527 billion years, slightly younger than the Earth. Absolute ages from radiometric dating were used to calibrate the relative ages of different parts of the lunar surface from crater-counting methods (see related article). Radioactive datingconfirmed what the lunar cratering record indicated: the smooth dark plains, the maria, are considerably younger than the heavily cratered highlands. Once relative ages from the cratering record were calibrated, absolute ages could also be found for other planetary surfaces, such as Mercury and Mars by assuming cratering rates were consistent throughout the inner solar system. Conclusion: The methods of radiometric dating have been refined over sixty years, and dozens of different radioactive species can be used for this research. When we apply the radioactive dating technique to all sorts of Solar System samples — terrestrial rocks, lunar rocks, and meteorites from deep space — they all yield an age of approximately 4. 6 billion years. The technique is based on the well-understood physics of radioactivity, which can be tested in the laboratory.  Scientists consider this proof of the age of the Earth, and it also led to the chronology of the entire Solar System. Consider this vast number for a moment. Compared to this, all the generations of humanity are only the blink of a cosmic eye. We’ve been around for less than a tenth of one percent of the history of our planet!

    "body": "2022/01/31 -  Starting from the history of star classification in the millinniums, this interesting note will take you through some of the very basic concepts on emission-line stars. You will be able to understand what they are and why these type of stars are my special children. The article will pose a number of very fundamental yet unresolved questions on these groups waiting to be unraveled from the nature. PS: You will not regret opening this link!   Figure 1: The most comprehensive Hubble deep field image of the evolving universe. Image source:Hubblesite . Author’s note:  I can stare all day at the image above showing details of a large number of Galaxies and stars which are the building blocks of the visible universe we know. The expanding universe, the infrared afterglow, litter from the most distant parts of our universe, remind me of the nearer still, the largely unaffected bounty of the space in my presence. Even being an ignorant survival, these depths and darkness leading one to their origin are intriguing. Introduction:: The best way to understand a system is to observe and question their behavior leading to logical reasons. In this manner, for ages, many incredible minds have corroborated the nature of stars, observed them over years, mapped their positions to good accuracy, and questioned their fundamentals, for many which even today we do not know answers to. As a first step towards this process, we explore the different types of stars and their nature using the stellar spectral classification. Stellar classification:: The oldest ever known catalogue of stars in the sky dates back to the 2nd millennium BC (1531- 1155 BC), which upgraded in number over years. But, the catalogued stars were classified into different categories based on their observable properties only by the late 19th century. Through observations, we understand that stars differ in colour and temperature. To understand these observable differences, we categorized stars based on their temperature into different ‘stellar spectral types’, assigning one alphabet for each class. The sequence of stars presently adopted, begins with the hottest stars, class O, and proceeds from hot to cool in the order: O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. Most of the stars in the visible universe can be classified into one of these groups.   Figure 2: The HR-diagram of stellar classifications. The X-axis shows different spectral types from hot massive O stars to cooler M stars. Image source: Astronomytrek . Hot massive stars usually include stars in the spectral type range O to A. It is interesting though that the physical properties, internal structure, chemical nature, and the observables of hotter stars are very different from that of their cooler counterparts. A special category of these hot stars is the emission-line stars which show prominent emission features in their spectrum. A closer look into this category reveals that not all hot massive stars show emission-line signatures. To date, we have insufficient details to explain why this nature is not universal. Many interesting studies have been conducted to date in examining the observational properties and statistical nature of these emission-line stars. What do we know about emission-line stars?: As mentioned earlier, the term emission-line stars (ELS) denote stellar objects that show emission features in their spectrum. In general, hot ELS include Classical Ae/Be type stars, Herbig Ae/Be type stars, Wolf-Rayet stars, supergiants, etc. The mechanism of the emission-line formation differs between each of these classes. Taking into consideration Classical Ae/Be stars, a group of ELS enclosing hot massive Oe, Be, and Ae stars (where ‘e’ stands for emission). The emission lines in this group of stars are known to originate from a cooler disk-shaped envelope surrounding the star. The disk is composed of ionized gas and surrounds the star equatorially. The mechanism of such a gaseous equatorial disk formation is termed the Be phenomenon.   Figure 3: An artistic impression of a Classical Be star. Note the presence of a circumstellar envelope in the shape of a disk surrounding the star. Image source: Wikimedia commons . Classical Be and Classical Ae stars: As mentioned earlier, I consider Classical Be (CBe hereafter) and Classical Ae (CAe hereafter) stars as one of the very interesting classes of objects. After 150+ years of their first detection, these stars still pose a great challenge in understanding them completely. The most fundamental (yet unresolved) question about these stars is that, Why do these stars form a circumstellar disk? It has to be noted that not all B-type stars are CBe stars, not all A-type stars CAe stars. Why do we see a selection for this emission mechanism in nature?. The better we study these stars in detail, the better we get to understand them. This research article titled Identification of new Classical Ae stars in the Galaxy using LAMOST DR5 intends at compiling the very first homogeneous catalogue of the CAe stars from our Galaxy. Identification of Classical Ae stars. : This article makes use of one of the largest spectroscopic databases of the Galaxy – Large sky Area Multi-Object fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), undertaken by the Chinese academy of sciences, situated at Xinglong Station, China. They identified about 4,789 A-type emission-line stars (Hα shows emission profile) from the LAMOST database. As quoted previously, many types of objects can show this emission feature. To identify the CAe stars, they made use of the infra-red photometric properties. The idea behind this selection is that the circumstellar disk of CBe/CAe stars will give rise to additional flux excess in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. By filtering out stars showing this additional flux, the team identified 159 new CAe stars from the Galaxy. CBe stars versus CAe stars: From Figure. 2 we understand that A-type stars are comparatively cooler than B-type stars.  Hence, the CAe stars are considered cooler counterparts of CBe stars. Though these systems show a similar presence of circumstellar disk, it is important to understand how their disk properties change concerning their temperature. This study provides a dedicated section on comparing the observed spectroscopic features of CBe stars and the CAe stars. They were able to predict that the CAe stars could host smaller disks compared to CBe stars. Apart from hydrogen, this study identified the presence of ionized metallic lines of FeII, Ca II, OI, etc in the spectra of the CAe stars and that these features are similar to that of CBe stars. This article provided new insights on the nature of the CAe stars and motivates the research community to study further study and compare them to CBe stars for a better understanding of the Be phenomenon.

    "title": "Shedding Light on the Cosmic Web with Fast Radio Bursts",
    "body": "2022/01/23 -  Fast Radio Bursts are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin. Their dispersion measures are sensitive to the presence of ionized matter along their lines of sight. This unique measurable makes FRBs a promising cosmological probe that can shed light on a hitherto invisible matter reservoir that constitutes the universe.  The study of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is one of the fastest developing fields of astronomical research. 1 Discovered serendipitously only in 2007 by Lorimer et al, FRBs are bright, millisecond-duration transient radio events. According to some estimates, thousands of FRBs occur in the sky daily. If one could see the sky in the radio frequencies, they would look like Fig. 1.   Figure 1: An artist’s rendition of what FRBs look like in the radio wavelengths. Credit: NRAO outreach Most FRBs detected have extragalactic origins with the only exception being two recently discovered radio pulse emissions from a Milky Way magnetar, a compact remnant of a supernova that sports extremely strong magnetic fields, SGR 1935+2154. As the FRB pulses travel through space, they are dispersed by plasma (ionized matter) that permeates the universe, just like sunlight disperses in a prism into a rainbow. This means the higher frequency components of the pulse travel faster than the lower frequency waves. Fig. 2 shows the dispersed pulse reported by Lorimer et al. The amount of dispersion is quantified by the Dispersion Measure (DM). DM is defined as the line-of-sight integral of electron density, weighted by the cosmological scale factor. In Fig. 2, the DM essentially tells you how far apart the 1. 5 GHz and 1. 2 GHz components are. Measuring DM therefore relies on accurately estimating the arrival delay between the high and low frequencies constituting the light and since the delay is of the order of a few seconds. Lorimer et al could not account for the burst’s large DM using estimates of matter density within our galaxy alone. It was very much this dispersion that led Lorimer et al to postulate they are extragalactic in origin. In fact, it was several times larger and the burst was estimated to have originated at a distance of &lt;1 Gigaparsec (Gpc). The sharp FRB pulse is therefore quite a unique and powerful probe of ionized matter on cosmological scales. Previously available cosmological probes of matter like quasar absorption lines are largely “blind” to ionized matter as fully ionized hydrogen and helium (which makes up most of the universe) do not produce any line features.   Figure 2: The dispersed pulse of the Lorimer Burst. The dark curve is the FRB event. The horizontal axis shows the time relative to a reference. The higher frequency components of the pulse come before the low frequency components and thus the curve goes from the top-left to bottom-right. The shape of the curve is governed by plasma physics. The inset image shows the pulse when all the frequencies are aligned (i. e. the curve is straightened) and summed over. Note how sharp the pulse is compared to the total time of the FRB event (~0. 4 s). Emission or absorption line features are manifestations of the quantum nature of an atom. In the ionized state, i. e. when atoms are stripped of their electrons, there is no quantum system to produce said features. Furthermore, continuum (i. e. non line-like) emission from electrons/ions in the intergalactic medium is extremely hard to detect due to its sparsity. FRB dispersions on the other hand provide a direct measure of the line-of-sight integrated ionized matter density. Due to their transient nature, it is only recently that FRBs have been localized in the sky with a precision better than an arcsecond thanks to advances in radio interferometry. The first FRB to be precisely localized was FRB 20121102 (by Tendulkar et al in 2017), which using the American Very Large Array (VLA), was pinpointed to a small, highly star-forming galaxy at a redshift of 0. 19. This FRB was first detected by the Arecibo telescope in 2012 and then since the source burst repeatedly albeit sporadically over the years, it was finally captured with the radio interferometer that is the VLA in 2017. In 2018, Bannister et al detected and simultaneously localized the FRB 20180924 thanks to the Australian Square-Kilometer-Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and a new technique of performing radio interferometry. ASKAP consists of several large radio antenna pointing in the same direction in the sky. The telescope essentially looks for a transient in the non-interferometric mode2, i. e. without correlating the signal from its individual antennae, to maximize the area of the sky scanned. The moment it detects a transient, the data in its buffer gets dumped to an external storage space for post-detection correlation and subsequently localization. Since the first detection, ASKAP has localized several FRBs and will continue doing so. Precise localization is crucial in pegging the FRB’s distance as the pulse itself does not carry precise information about the redshift3. Localization is crucial to identify the host galaxy and spectroscopic follow-up observations of the host yield the redshift or distance estimate4.   Figure 3: UV image of the FRB 20190608 host galaxy showing the active starforming regions (Chittidi et al 2020). The red circle/white rectangle shows the radio-derived location of the FRB which is coincident with one of the starforming clumps. Given the dispersion and the distance to the FRBs, one can start constraining the matter distribution in the foreground universe. One FRB sightline that we studied in detail was that of FRB 20190608 (see Simha et al 2020). This FRB was localized to a spiral galaxy at redshift 0. 3215 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) footprint. A UV Hubble image of the galaxy showed that the FRB originated from one of the star-forming clumps within a spiral arm (Fig. 3). Due to its fortunate location within the SDSS database, we had extensive spectroscopic information of the field galaxies. This informed us about the location of foreground galaxies relative to the sightline and thus, with some modeling, the contribution of different foreground electron reservoirs to the FRB DM. Being an integrated quantity, the DM can be split into multiple parts corresponding to the source of electrons. That is, DMFRB = DMMW + DMhalos + DMIGM + DMhost Here DMMW is the contribution from the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM) and halo, DMhost is a similar term but for the host galaxy, DMhalos is from the gas present in intervening galactic halos and DMIGM is from the diffuse filamentary gas that permeates the cosmic web5. In our work, we aimed to estimate each of these individual subcomponents from optical observations. For the Milky Way, we used models of the ISM electron distribution constructed using galactic pulsars (NE2001; Cordes and Lazio 2003). We modeled the gas distribution of the halo as a modified NFW profile (see Prochaska and Zheng 2019 for details). In total, of the 340 pc cm-3of the FRB DM, we estimated roughly 80 pc cm-3 arising from the Milky Way. Chittidi et al 2020 estimated the DMhost~100 pc cm-3 using integral field unit (IFU)6 observations with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) and the same halo model as the one used for the Milky Way. Using the SDSS and WISE photometry available for the field galaxies in tandem with the spectroscopic redshifts, we estimated the stellar masses of foreground galaxies. Then, using the stellar-to-halo-mass ratio from Moster et al 2013, we estimated their halo masses. Assuming that the halo gas typically extends up to one virial radius7, we determined which halos intersect the FRB sightline and then using our modified NFW halo gas model, determined their DM contributions. We estimated DMhalos ~ 20 pc cm-3. Estimating DMIGM was perhaps the most challenging as one cannot directly observe diffuse filamentary gas, its presence is generally inferred indirectly. However, since we had access to the SDSS galaxy redshifts, we could, in theory, reconstruct the cosmic web density using them as tracers. Thus, we leveraged the Monte-Carlo Physarum Machine (MCPM) model introduced by Burchett et al in 2020 to do exactly this. The algorithm is inspired by the motion of Physarum polycephalum or slime mold. The mold efficiently searches for food particles and produces a filamentary network connecting them in its wake. Modeling the galaxies as “food”, one can produce a steady-state slime mold particle density with MCPM and translate this to physical matter density by calibrating against dark matter density in cosmological simulations. The result (see Fig. 4) is an estimate of gas density along the sightline.   Figure 4: Cosmic web density “reconstruction” using the MCPM algorithm for the FRB 20190608 sightline. Though galaxies were cone-searched around the FRB, as it is located in one of the narrow strips of SDSS, there were more spectra available in one direction (top) than the other (side) and thus our model doesn’t appear conical. Using this model, we estimated DMIGM ~ 110 pc cm-3. Thus just using optical data, we were able to estimate DMFRB and closely match the radio measurement. Our model uncertainties are fairly large (~30%) but nevertheless, this work was a proof of concept that FRB DMs can inform us about the matter distribution in the universe. Furthermore, if this analysis is performed on multiple sightlines, we can start laying statistical constraints on some of the key model parameters that were only assumed in this work e. g. the fraction of the universe’s baryons in the filamentary gas and the fraction of halo gas present in the hot (&gt;106 K) ionized phase. In fact, our future work on the FLIMFLAM (FRB Line-of-sight Ionization Measurement with Lightcone AAOmega Mapping) survey intends to achieve ~ 10% constraints on these parameters using ~25 sightlines. We are currently collecting spectroscopic redshifts of field galaxies along multiple sightlines and hope to start producing preliminary results within the next year. FRB-aided cosmology promises exciting research in the near future. [1] See Petroff et al 2019 for an excellent review. [2] See the CRAFT webpage and this article for more details on the survey and the telescope. [3] Though the dispersion is correlated to the distance, there are many sources of uncertainty in the DM-redshift relation. [4] Astronomers use redshift as a proxy for distance when it comes to cosmological scales. This is thanks to the Hubble relation. [5] This is the large-scale structure of matter in the universe. As dark matter (and regular matter) condensed gravitationally after the Big Bang, it created halos and filamentary structures connecting halos, giving it a web-like appearance. [6] IFUs are specialized instruments that can take images as well as spectra of the field-of-view simultaneously. [7] A virial radius of a halo is the radius from its center within which the halo dark matter density is roughly 200 times larger than the background value. Think of it as the radial extent of the halo matter.

    "title": "Using machine learning to infer Solar coronal heating",
    "body": "2022/01/17 -  This article traces the origins of the coronal heating problem, and describes in vivid detail our efforts in resolving this through machine learning. This is a non-technical article based on our paper, but references have been appended for the interested reader!  The Sun is a spectacular celestial object that has captivated humanity for long and holds many unresolved secrets. It is a huge ball of gas, mainly made of hydrogen, but containing many other elements like Sodium, Calcium, Magnesium, Iron, etc. Generally, the Sun is seen as a disc in the sky. This disc of the Sun is known as photosphere, or the surface of the Sun. However, during a total solar eclipse when the Sun is hidden by the moon, streams of gas may be seen extending outwards from the photosphere as shown below. This faint region of the solar atmosphere is called the Solar corona.   Fig. 1: Image of the extended solar corona taken during an eclipse. Image source: Nicolas Lefaudeux . Since the 1900s, astronomers have been studying the Sun and various stars through the spectrum of these stars. The spectrum of any star is basically the amount of light emitted at different wavelengths. Light as we know can be (for our purposes!) thought of as a wave1, with the wavelength telling us, in some sense, how long each wave is. Stars produce light of various wavelengths, which is mainly controlled by its temperature at the photosphere. However, different elements in the atmosphere of stars can also give rise to bumps or dips in this spectrum, depending on how many electrons each element has. The number of electrons however depends on how hot the particular atom or ion is. Generally, the hotter an ion is, the fewer electrons it has. Hence, such bumps can be used to measure the temperature at various locations (and not just at the photosphere!) in the atmosphere of stars. This was the seminal contribution of Meghnad Saha and Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin2. Early on, astronomers analyzed the photosphere of the Sun, and found it to be at approximately 5500 K. In the 1940s, astronomers then took to analyzing the spectrum of the solar corona. Now, common sense tells us that as one moves away from a hot object, the temperature must reduce. Hence, we expect the solar corona to be at a lower temperature than the photosphere. However, astronomers found that as one moves from the photosphere into the solar atmosphere, the temperature initially drops and then starts rising to more than a million degrees Kelvin in the corona (Bengt Edlen. , 1945, P. Swings. , 1945)! The corona was found to be so hot, that elements like Iron, which generally have 26 electrons in their atoms, had lost more than 13 electrons! How does this occur? This has been a long-standing puzzle with a deceptively simple answer. The simple answer is: common sense is correct. Only if one moves away from a hot object will one expect the temperature to fall. It would not be the case if, for some reason, heat is generated in the solar corona. This heat source keeps the corona hot and at a million degrees Kelvin. Then the question arises: What is this source of heat? A simple guess can be made by looking at the Sun at the photosphere and in the corona. The picture below is taken from a suite of instruments called Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)[Paul Boerner et al. , 2012] &amp; Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)[P. H. Scherrer et al. , 2011] on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). SDO is a NASA satellite which observes the Sun predominantly in the photosphere and the corona. Think of it as an extremely complex camera (which it literally is!), taking pictures across different temperatures for scientists to study. The left image shows the map of the Magnetic field along the line of sight across the photosphere, with black and white representing negative and positive magnetic field polarities respectively. The grey areas have very weak magnetic fields, while the field is stronger if the color is blacker or whiter. On the right, we have the corresponding image of the corona, taken from AIA. Compare these two images carefully: it seems that the black/white areas from the magnetic field are located in the same regions as the bright areas in the corona. Hence it seems that the corona is brighter for regions with a stronger magnetic field. Might this be related to the corona’s temperature?  Fig. 2: On the left, we have the magnetic field on the Sun’s photosphere, taken through HMI. On the right, we have an image of the solar corona, taken through AIA. Image source: NASA/SDO HMI &amp; AIA . It was realized early on that the magnetic field of the Sun contains a lot of energy. This energy can, in principle, be used up to heat the corona. We now ask deeper questions: How does this occur? And how do we know this energy is enough to heat the corona? One of the more popular mechanisms of converting magnetic energy to heat is through impulsive events (Parker, E. N. , 1988). Impulsive events are basically bursts of energy, where magnetic energy is dissipated as heat. The impulsive events, which convert magnetic to heat energy, are known to occur at a variety of length and time scales. These could be large or small and may last for hours or minutes, depending on how much energy was released. The large versions of these events, which release tremendous amounts of energy, are well known as solar flares. Many studies have been done on these large flares or on smaller events called microflares. The microflares, as the name suggests, have a million times less energy than the large flares. However, they are much more frequent in the corona. The hypothesis by Parker, E. N. , 1988, and further expansion by Hudson. H. S. , 1991; is that such impulsive events are much more frequent if they have low energy, and a combination of such events may maintain the coronal temperature. This is called the nanoflare hypothesis. It essentially translates to the hypothesis that one first needs to count the number of events that occur at each energy scale. Then, suppose one finds the total heat dissipated due to all such events at each energy to be larger for smaller events. In that case, impulsive heating is enough to maintain the solar corona’s temperature. Studies generally attempt to count how many events occur at given energy and get a sense of how much energy is released in such events. Then, they compare if these energies are enough to maintain the corona at a million-degree Kelvin or not. Such statistics, however, are ridden with a grave fallacy: If individual events can be seen, we can count them. What if we cannot even see these individual events? What if all we see is a combination of a multitude of such events? This question has plagued solar physicists for a long time. A possible answer to this question lies in what in the corona do we see. Studies are generally targeted towards the large, bright, and beautiful structures called Active Regions. In Fig. 3, a picture of the solar corona is seen. Immediately, we can see that there is a bright region near the center, and this is called an Active Region. These active regions contain a large amount of magnetic energy which can be converted to heat. However, there are other regions in the corona where there are no beautiful large structures. These structures are known as Quiet regions.  Approximately every 11 years, the Sun is seen to wake up, become violent, and then go to sleep. This is known as the solar cycle. The active regions are predominantly seen when the Sun is active (the violence comes from active regions, mostly!). The solar corona, on the other hand, is hot even when the Sun is quiet and sleeping! This means we must study this quiet time to figure out coronal heating!  Fig. 3: The solar corona as seen from the 211 A passband of AIA shows two distinct structures here. One kind of structure is the bright Active Regions, and the other is the background calm Quiet Sun. Image source: Solar Dynamics Observatory . In our work, we addressed (or rather, incorporated) both of these characteristics to provide constraints on the viability of these impulsive events. First off, we took only the Quiet Sun data. All other large, dynamic events were left out. Second, we used a statistical impulsive heating model (A. Pauluhn et al. , 2006) to infer heating signatures. But how? Enter Deep learning. Deep learning is a set of techniques (generally referring to neural networks) used to perform inferences on big data. These neural networks can “learn” the data given to them and perform any assigned task. When you check for translation of words on Google, it basically deploys deep learning in the background. The neural network used for such language-to-language translations has been trained on many statements and correspondences between two languages. Hence, when you ask it to translate words (or even sentences), it can translate pretty much very well! For our work, we took the statistical impulsive heating model and made a large number of simulations. The impulsive heating model generates a time series of intensity (called light curves), given some free parameters. These simulations statistically would represent the light curves of the Quiet corona. However, there are no objective techniques to compare these simulations with observations in a statistically robust manner. Hence, we trained our deep learning model on mapping the light curves back to the free parameters. This is called learning an inversion code. The inversion code takes in the light curves, analyzes them in a highly complicated non-linear way, and gives out the best parameter set representing the light curve. The inversion code is checked on a testing set of simulations. Think of this whole procedure as attending a class (=training) and writing an exam (=testing). Since you typically do not know what questions will be asked in an exam, the testing set contains simulations that were not used for training. Hence, the performance of the inversion code is checked and validated in this way. Once this inversion code is checked, we apply it on approx. 3,00,000 light curves from the Sun to infer the free parameters. In this way, we circumvent the problem of not seeing individual events in the Quiet Sun – we can infer their statistical signatures! This scheme is explained below:  Fig. 4: A summary of our procedure. The simulated light curves are mapped to their parameters by training a deep learning model, which in our case is a Convolutional Neural Network. Then, these parameters can be inferred by feeding in the observed light curves in the model. So what do we get from applying this elaborate scheme? We find the impulsive events occur at a frequency of around 2 events per minute. Each event lasts approximately 10-20 mins. Overall, we find smaller events to dominate over larger events, which seems to confirm the hypothesis of impulsive heating of the corona. Then, we studied various properties of these heating events. First, we found that events can be either large and occur rarely, or be very small and occur frequently. This means that there exists a well of energy, that can be emptied by occasional large buckets or very frequent small buckets. Second, we found that larger events die down much faster than smaller events. This counterintuitive result seems to arrive as a result of what is called thermal conduction. Thermal conduction is the reason why, if you leave the ladle for too long in the kadai, it gets very hot. Heat travels through metal efficiently, and makes it hotter. Hotter the kadai3, the faster the ladle gets hotter. Similar phenomenon occurs in the corona, but here the ladle is the magnetic field lines, and the kadai is the impulsive event. The thermal conduction along magnetic field lines is very efficient, so the more the energy, the faster it is transmitted. We find signatures of this thermal conduction through our analysis. Finally, we find excellent correspondence between the properties of these small-scale events and large-scale events like solar flares. It almost seems like the small events we find are like younger siblings of the large-scale flares. And through a marriage of deep learning with solar physics knowledge, we can impose constraints on the heating of the solar corona!

    "title": "Bar Buckling and Boxy/Peanut Bulges as the Tracer of Dark Matter Halo Shape",
    "body": "2022/01/14 -  Galaxies reside in the deep potential of invisible matter called dark matter. Their dynamics is significantly affected by the distribution of dark matter around them. Distribution of dark matter around galaxies is usually known as dark matter halo. Most of the previous studies of galaxies assumed spherical dark matter halos. But, cosmological simulations of structure formation suggest that the dark matter halo can vary in shape. It can also have non-spherical shape (e. g. oblate and prolate) which can significantly influence the evolution of the galaxy. In this study, Astronomer from IIA, Bangalore and SJTU, China have studied the effect of non-spherical dark matter halos on the buckling of the bars and formation of boxy/peanut shape bulges. They perfomed a set of numerical simulation for varying dark matter halo shape and traced the formation of bars and boxy/peanut shape bulges.  If you look at the clear night sky, you may find a white bright band stretching from north to south in the sky. It is nothing but our home galaxy, the Milky Way. There are trillions of galaxies in our observable Universe. Galaxies are gravitationally bound systems of stars, gas, dust, and invisible matter called dark matter. Galaxies come in different shapes and sizes ranging from spherical - like a ball to disk - like a round plate. Since most of the disk galaxies have spiral arms, they are also called spiral galaxies. Depending on the presence of a bar, a spiral galaxy could be a barred spiral or unbarred spiral. Disk galaxies usually possess a dense collection of stars in their centres which is termed as the bulge. Bulges can range from nearly spherical to as flat as the disk of galaxies. Our Milky way has a boxy/peanut shape flat bulge which is supposed to have formed from the thickening of the bar.   Figure 1: Example of unbarred and barred galaxies. Image source:NED . The matter we can see in a galaxy is far less than its actual matter content. More than 80% of the total galaxy mass is invisible to us. Only the motion of the stars or gas in the galaxy shows the presence of dark matter. This invisible matter is commonly referred to as dark matter. Due to the presence of an enormous amount of dark matter in the galaxy, the dynamics of the stars is remarkably affected by the distribution of the dark matter. In the past, there have been several detailed studies of the galaxies assuming the spherical distribution of dark matter in the galaxies. There are very limited works that consider the non-spherical distribution of dark matter for the study of galaxies. In the present paper, Ankit Kumar and the team have investigated the effect of non-spherical dark matter distribution on the bar buckling and the formation of boxy/peanut flat bulge like that seen in our Galaxy. Bar buckling is a bar thickening mechanism where the bar suddenly bends out of the disk of the galaxy. Bar buckling can be simply understood using a practical example of a beam or pillar. Say, there is a vertically standing beam and you start increasing the load on it. Then at some point, it will suddenly bend somewhere in the middle (or may collapse). This sudden change is called the buckling of the beam.   Figure 2: Examples of oblate, spherical, and prolate dark matter halos in a disk galaxy. Image source: Author. Authors have used the supercomputing facility to generate mock realistic disk galaxies and to evolve them in time. The distribution of dark matter in the galaxies ranges from oblate to prolate including spherical one. Oblate distribution (or oblate halo) looks like the shape formed on squeezing a sphere from its top and bottom whereas prolate distribution (or prolate halo) is similar to the shape formed on stretching a sphere from its top and bottom. To trace the formation and evolution of the bar and buckling events, they used Fourier analysis and found that the galaxies in prolate halos form bar earlier than the galaxies in oblate halos. Also, the bar in prolate halos buckles before the bar in the oblate halos. Fourier analysis is the method to decompose any general function or structure into simple trigonometric functions or structures with definite frequencies (see this article  for Fourier series). Buckling events are very rarely observed. To date, there are only 8 confirmed galaxies that are currently going through the buckling events. In this study, Ankit Kumar and the team found three distinct buckling events for the bar in the prolate halo. It is the first time where more than two buckling events in a bar have been detected in any study. The total duration of buckling is longer for the bar in the prolate halo. The rarity of buckling in observations and longer duration buckling in the prolate halos lead authors to conclude that most of the dark matter halos could be oblate and spherical in shape.   A clear buckling of the iso-density contour can be seen in the outer bar of the prolate halo during the 3rd buckling event. It also shows the formation and growth of peanut shape bulge after bar buckling. Image source: Kumar et. al. 2021. . Each buckling event makes the bar thick in size. First buckling thickens the innermost region of the bar while the succeeding bucklings thicken the outer regions of the bar. As a result of these thickening boxy/peanut shape flat bulge forms. Since the bar in the prolate halo shows more buckling events as compared to the oblate halo, the bar in prolate halo thickens the most and forms the most thicker boxy/peanut shape bulge.

    "title": "Using GitHub for Academic Research",
    "body": "2022/01/10 -  GitHub has become the go-to tool for software engineers across the world to keep their codes together and collaborate with each other. Being easy, seamless, and available on all the platforms makes it a brilliant choice indeed.  I am involved in academic research for quite some time now and can find some pretty good uses for this platform. Of course, GitHub was designed to keep the codes together and collaborate and this is the backbone of research too, which is why I find GitHub quite appealing. There are obvious benefits of using GitHub:  Keeping all the codes and data files together offline as well as a backup on the GitHub servers.  Version control for all the files.  Collaborating on projects together.  Managing the research projects and keeping track of the issues.  Free hosting for websites. For beginners, it is helpful to go through the basic documentation about GitHub. For example a YouTube video introducing GitHub is available below: Besides the GitHub website itself, there are plenty of other websites and tutorials available on the web. I am including a few bare essentials that one needs to go through in order to understand what GitHub is:  Creating a git repository Cloning a git repository A tutorial for git usage Guide to git version control Introduction to Branches GitHub Project Boards Github pagesThe idea of having a single repository (in git terminology folder is repository) for a project helps a lot in reducing confusion and saves a lot of time. It indeed is a good habit. Making that repository a git repository and putting it on GitHub is an even better habit. People working with Jupyter notebooks may find GitHub extremely helpful, especially in terms of executing the notebooks in the clouds. nbviewer can load the notebooks directly from the git repository which can then be executed directly on binder. Even Google colab allows the import of notebooks from GitHub directly to be executed there. HackMD, a Markdown editor allows the files to be pushed to and pulled from GitHub. In astronomy, most of the code is often open-source and available to the community. Some researchers provide links to their codes hosted on GitHub which becomes easier to obtain and raise any issues. The point is that the familiarity with GitHub is advantageous. People sometimes present their entire work, including the codes, plots, and related text files on GitHub as a repository which indeed serves as a welcome step towards reproducible research. Now, my personal bent towards git is motivated by the reproducibility of research. In the world of academic research reproducibility has often been cited as a problem (see this BBC report or Nature article). Reproducibility should be the backbone of research as scientific findings work on this principle. Maintaining a git project should help in establishing this easily. One may put the link to the entire working repository once their findings are published so that anyone willing to re-do the analysis does that seamlessly. People have even proposed a GitHub type of social network for academic research. I have tried to implement GitHub for all my research projects, and the workflow has only gone smoother with time. The project management becomes easy, versions are easy to track and overall the repository structure becomes more transparent with time. I don’t waste time looking for individual files anymore, as they have been neatly arranged in the respective places. With a backup on the GitHub cloud server, it becomes easy to access any item from any device. Working on multiple devices too becomes easy as I can run multiple items in parallel and then push to the respective branches and merge them subsequently. Moreover, the project boards are a neat way to organize all the work. We can have work in progress, work to be done, and work that has been completed arranged in the form of cards. We may open an issue from these cards themselves. Github pages are also one of the noticeable features of Github as it lets one host personal webpages on GitHub, which again I feel is well suited for us. The static website can be put up easily using Jekyll. The academic pages template is used by thousands of researchers and scientists around the world to keep their content together on a static web page. My personal website is hosted on GitHub too. Pushing things on the website is as easy as typing up a markdown or HTML file and pushing it onto GitHub. GitHub as a service provides us with an option to manage our workflow in an eficient way, without worrying about versions of documents and provides seamless collaboration features. I hope with this article I have provided some useful insight into this service. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. "

    "title": "How strong is a neutron star's magnetic field? <br> ",
    "body": "2022/01/05 - Estimating the strength of the magnetic field of a neutron star in a binary star system ‘Cen X-3’:  Researchers from Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bangalore, report the detection of cyclotron resonant absorption feature (CRSF) in the X-ray spectrum of the binary star system ‘Cen X-3’. The magnetic field of the neutron star in Cen X-3 is estimated from the CRSF. This work is a step forward in understanding the nature of humongous magnetic fields of Neutron Stars.  Researchers from Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bangalore, report interesting findings about the binary star system ‘Cen X-3’ from the constellation ‘Centaurus’, one of the most luminous X-ray sources in our galaxy and the first-ever X-ray pulsar to be discovered. Their findings published in the Monthly Notices of Royal Astronomical Society, uses data from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) of NASA and Suzaku, an X-ray satellite operated by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.  Cen X-3 is a two-star system consisting of a pulsar - a highly magnetized neutron star beaming X-rays - and a companion star. The magnetic field of a neutron star in Cen X-3 is estimated in this work. The findings also provide insights into understanding the nature of humongous magnetic fields of Neutron Stars. Imagine a star as massive as our Sun but only a few kilometers across in size: that’s a neutron star! It is so dense that the mass of the entire living human population could fit into a sugar cube-sized neutron star matter. In other words, it is like an entire Mount Everest squeezed to fit inside a coffee cup. Owing to their extreme density, the gravitational field of a neutron star is the strongest except for black holes. In fact, if they were any denser, they would become black holes themselves. Neutron stars have some pretty bizarre properties. Their gravity is strong enough to bend light. They are extremely hot, with a surface temperature of nearly a million degrees Celsius. Even stars hate to be alone! The majority of the neutron stars like the one in Cen X-3 are a part of a binary star system with the main sequence or post main sequence star as a companion. The neutron star gravitationally accretes matter from its companion star. The accretion disk is formed around the neutron star when the angular momentum of the accreted matter is too large for the direct impact onto the neutron star surface.   Figure 1: Inside the magnetosphere, the accreting matter is channeled along the magnetic field lines and onto the magnetic poles forming an accretion column. Image used here is available at this URL. Accretion of matter onto a compact object such as a neutron star or black hole is one of the most efficient ways known for extracting energy from matter. The denser the object, the higher is the efficiency! Part of this energy is emitted in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The magnetic field of a neutron star is almost a trillion times greater than that of the Earth. Such a high magnetic field dictates the accretion flow inside the magnetosphere. The accreting matter is channeled along the magnetic field lines and onto the magnetic poles forming an accretion column. The neutron star’s rotational axis is not necessarily aligned with its magnetic axis. Such misalignment gives rise to highly periodic pulsations hence the name ‘pulsars’.   Figure 2: Illustration of an accretion-powered pulsar. The magnetic axis sweeps earth in every rotation of the neutron star due to misalignment between the rotational axis and the magnetic axis giving rise to highly periodic pulsations. The image used here is available at this URL. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, all particles show wave-like characteristics. The wavelength associated with the particle is called the de Broglie wavelength (λ de Broglie = Planck’s constant/momentum). The length scales that we deal with in day-to-day life are much larger than the de Broglie wavelength of the particles. The wave nature of the particles and associated quantum mechanical phenomenon becomes apparent only when the length scale of the system is comparable to its de Broglie wavelength.   Figure 3: Landau quantization and resonant scatteringImage courtesy: Ashwin Devaraj (IISc-JAP) In the presence of a magnetic field, the charged particles in the accretion column rotate around the magnetic field lines in a helical trajectory. Larger the magnetic field, the smaller the radius of gyration. The orbits and corresponding energies are quantized due to a phenomenon called landau quantization; however, its effect becomes significant only in the presence of an extremely strong magnetic field where the radius of the gyration of the infalling particle is of the order of its de Broglie wavelength. The photons generated during the accretion undergo scattering with the relativistically infalling matter in the accretion column. Due to resonance, the likelihood of scattering i. e. the scattering cross-section is maximum at the quantized Landau energy levels resulting in the absorption-like feature at those energies in the X-ray spectrum (energy distribution of the incident light). This feature is called a cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF). Figure 3 illustrates the quantization of the orbits and the resonant scattering of photons. Gunjan Tomar (RRI, Bangalore) and the team studied CRSF originated due to the scattering of photons with electrons in the X-ray spectrum of Cen X-3. The energy of the CRSF is directly related to the strength of the magnetic field. It is the only direct way to measure a neutron star’s magnetic field strength. The energy of the electron CRSF feature was observed to be around 30 KeV. The neutron star magnetic field can be estimated to be around 2. 6 x 1012 Gauss from this. The strength of the magnetic field of the neutron star increases steeply as one approaches the stellar surface. The CRSF energy is related to the magnetic field strength and thus depends on where the CRSF originates. The matter accretion rate which is directly related to the source luminosity is thought to affect the location of the origin of the CRSF feature. The relation between the CRSF energy and the source luminosity would strengthen the above argument. However, researchers could not find any such relation. This research is a step forward in understanding the gigantic magnetic field of a neutron star and its role in the accretion of matter.

    "title": "Deciphering The Mysteries of The Quiet Sun Explosions",
    "body": "2021/12/30 -  XSM onboard Chandrayaan 2 observed the Sun during its minimum activity period in 2019-2020. Using this data, the researchers have for the first time detected a very large number of small scale explosions, called microflares, happening on the Sun. The physical parameters of the microflares have been calculated and their spatial location is also detected using various satellites. The study also gives evidence that such small scale heating events occur everywhere on the Sun and they contribute to coronal heating.  The outer atmosphere (the corona) of the Sun poses a long standing mystery regarding its temperature. The solar corona is composed of plasma (ionised gas) that emits strongly in X-rays and ultraviolet radiation. Its temperature exceeds a million degree kelvin, while the visible surface (the photosphere) is at 6000K. One of the theories to understand the so-called ‘coronal heating problem’ proposes the occurrence of a large number of small scale explosions (known as microflares and nanoflares) on the Sun. It is known that these flares are a manifestation of the magnetic field of the Sun that is generated in its interior. But the Sun’s magnetic field is not constant, it varies with an average period of 11 years, which is known as the solar cycle. Approximately every 11 years, the Sun’s magnetic field reverses. In other words, the north pole becomes the south pole, and vice versa. The flip of the poles is an end product of the slow evolution of Sun’s magnetic field over time. As the cycle progresses, all of the Sun’s activities related to its magnetic field (such as sunspots, flares, coronal mass ejections) builds to a maximum (when the magnetic field reverses). Then the Sun settles back down to a minimum, before the whole cycle starts again. The Sun was in a very low state of activity during the minima of solar cycle 24 covering the year 2019. It was in fact the quietest the Sun has been in the last 100 years! During this quiet period of the Sun, at the mid of the year 2019, Chandrayaan 2 was launched with the several instruments/payloads to observed our moon and the Sun. Among them CLASS is an instrument to understand the abundance of elements present on the moon. But this requires knowledge of the X-rays emitted from the Sun. Thus, the orbiter also carried an instrument called Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM). XSM observed the Sun during its deepest minima of solar cycle 24, covering the year 2019-2020 with a good temporal and energy resolution. Using observations during this time, Santosh Vadawale and his team has uncovered some fascinating information about the quiescent Sun. They have shown that during this period small scale transients, so-called microflares (smaller counterpart of the conventional solar flares) are occurring everywhere on the solar disk. Solar flares are eruptions of electromagnetic radiation of all wavelengths from the Sun. They last from a few minutes to a few hours. Flares are classified depending on the energy they release during its peak in the soft X rays. Though the number of large flares increase with the progress of the solar cycle, this study suggested that small flares, called microflares, keep exploding on the Sun at all times. Though the definition of microflares has varied though the years due to the sensitivity of the instrument, in this study flares having a peak flux below 10-8 W/m2 are considered as microflares. During this period of extremely quiet solar corona when no active regions were present on the disk, Santosh Vadawale and team identified a total of 98 microflares from 76 days. The microflares are marked in the lightcurve (Figure 1). Most of the microflares were seen to behave similar to larger flares having a fast rise and a slow decay. Some microflares did not follow this behaviour possibly due to blending of multiple microflares or they intrinsically have a different origin. The temperature and emission measure of these microflares are determined. Temperature tells how hot the plasma gets during the explosion while the emission measure gives an idea about the density of plasma emitted at that particular temperature. The temperature is found to be between 3-6 MK and the emission measure is in the order of 1046 cm-3.  Figure 1: XSM lightcurve during the period of deepest solar minima of the past century. Red vertical lines indicate the detected microflares outside the conventional active regions. Image source: S. Vadawale et al. , 2021. The XSM microflare locations are identified in the extreme ultraviolet images obtained from NASA’s ‘Solar Dynamics Observatory’ and from the X-ray images obtained by the Japanese HINODE X-ray Telescope. Most microflares were seen to be associated with X-ray Bright Points. ‘Solar Dynamics Observatory’ HMI magnetograms were used to analyse the corresponding photospheric magnetic field. They observed the microflares to be associated with magnetic bipolar regions having weaker field strengths, which indicates magnetic reconnection happening at smaller scales (Figure 2).

This is also the first statistical survey of X-ray microflares outside active regions. By plotting the frequency distribution of microflares, the team has given evidence for the hypothesis that small scale heating events occur everywhere on the Sun and they contribute to coronal heating.

    "title": "Measuring the age of the Universe: An overview",
    "body": "2021/12/25 -  A popular article exploring how the age of the Universe was calculated.  Introduction: The previous article has already provided a flavour of how scientists use mathematics combined with knowledge obtained from physics to reveal numerous hidden secrets of nature such as the age of the Earth, the Moon and even the Solar System. But the story does not end here. It literally cannot. This is because the curiosity of human beings is unquenchable. Naturally, any curious mind will ask the next question, what is the age of the universe? Fortunately, the power of human intellect combined with the supreme efficiency of mathematics and physics have provided an answer to this almost impossible to solve question also. We now know with reasonable confidence that our universe is around 13. 8 billion (i. e. 1380 crore since 1 billion = 100 crore) years old. But, how do we measure the age of the universe? To know the answer, one has to study ‘cosmology’. This might be one of the most thrilling detective stories of all time. Cosmology is the study of the size, structure and evolution of the universe — in other words, the geography of the universe as a single system. In cosmology, our subject is the whole universe, defined as all matter and energy in existence anywhere, observable or not. Birth of cosmology: One of the most fundamental questions of humanity is the question of origins:  Where did we come from? This question runs deeper than the origins of any one person and delves into questions of where did life, our planet, and the entire universe come from. Many cultures have avoided the notion of an origin to the universe by placing their creation stories in a cycle. Buddhist and Hindu origins stories measure the birth, death, and rebirth of the universe in units of 4 trillion years, which is a day in the life of Brahma. At night, all matter is absorbed into the spirit of the sleeping Brahma. At dawn, when Brahma awakes, matter reappears and the cycle continues. The Greek Stoics saw the universe as being created from fire, only to be destroyed by fire, and so on. Cosmological cycles are also found in the cultures of the Maya and the Aztec. The story of modern cosmology began with Albert Einstein and Edwin Hubble. From Einstein’s theories, the shape of space is described as being warped by gravity. From the observations of Hubble, we learned the universe is expanding. Together these two men described the evolving shape of space and they opened up a new field of science called cosmology. The Big Bang model: The modern theory of the origin of the universe starts with the idea of expanding space. Georges Lemaître was a priest and a mathematician, an unassuming man who had beaten the giants of physics to the punch in deducing that the universe could be expanding. In 1929, Lemaître was the first to hypothesize a revolutionary idea: at one time, the universe might have been as small as an atomic nucleus. He proposed that the universe derived from a cosmic singularity, a day without a yesterday when the universe was infinitely small and infinitely curved, and all matter and energy were concentrated in a single point. Many astrophysicists found the idea bizarre and distasteful and English theorist Fred Hoyle disparaged the idea with the name big bang. The label stuck, and scientists continue to call the description of the creation of the universe the Big Bang model.   Figure 1: According to the Big Bang model, the universe expanded from an extremely dense and hot state and continues to expand todayImage source:Wikipedia . The Big Bang model forces us to consider the idea of cosmic evolution. The universal recession of galaxies implies that the universe is evolving, and it has not always been in the same state. Our observations of nearby galaxies represent a single frame in a movie that has been playing for billions of years. We can wind the tape backwards, seeing snapshots of a progressively older universe, by observing sets of galaxies at progressively larger distances, and thus at progressively larger look back times. (Since light takes time to travel, we see objects far away as they looked when the light was released rather than as they are now. ) As we look back into the early universe, we can see the galaxies move closer together. Observationally, we can’t see all the way back to the first moments, but we can see times when galaxies were just forming, and the large scale structures — the cosmic walls and voids — were just starting to form. If we could look further back, we’d see that as the universe gets smaller; its volume contracts until all the mass are smashed together in a tiny universe. The mass that formed galaxies and stars breaks down into a seething hot gas, as the universe tends toward a state of infinite temperature and density. Thinking of the Big Bang as an explosion is tempting, but it is also misleading. In an explosion on Earth, debris flies through space. In the Big Bang, the initial singularity contains all space and matter. Time itself begins with the big bang. The evolution of the universe is the unfolding of time and space from a condition of incredible heat and density to cold and enormous state billions of years later. This bang had no center, it had no past and it simply was the sudden beginning of everything in an expanding geometry that may or may not be finite. The scientific story of creation says that everything — you and the Earth and the Sun and the Milky Way and all the billions of galaxies — emerged from a tiny dense dot of energy and matter that unfolded into the universe we see now. It sounds as fantastic as any of the creation myths of older cultures. How do we know that the big bang actually occurred? There are three primary pieces of evidence:  Galaxies are taking part in a universal expansion as indicated by the linear relation between distance and redshift (the Hubble relation).  The abundance of the lightest elements can be explained by fusion in the universe when it was young and dense and hot (cosmic nucleosynthesis).  Space is filled with the radiation from the early hot phase, now diluted and reduced in energy to the level of microwaves (the cosmic microwave background). Describing each of these concepts is beyond the scope of this article. But the Hubble relation mentioned in the first point bears huge importance in measuring the age of the universe. Hence, I shall take the opportunity to discuss in brief the Hubble relation. Hubble relation or Hubble’s law: The Hubble relation, popularly known as the Hubble’s law or Hubble–Lemaître law is considered the first observational basis for the expansion of the universe and today serves as one of the pieces of evidence most often cited in support of the Big Bang model. Although widely attributed to Edwin Hubble, the notion of the universe expanding at a calculable rate was first derived from the general relativity equations in 1922 by Alexander Friedmann. Friedmann published a set of equations, now known as the Friedmann equations, showing that the universe might expand, and presenting the expansion speed if this was the case. Then Georges Lemaître, in a 1927 article, independently derived that the universe might be expanding, observed the proportionality between the recessional velocity of and distance to distant bodies and suggested an estimated value of the proportionality constant, which when corrected by Hubble became known as the Hubble constant. Then in 1929, Edwin Hubble confirmed the existence of cosmic expansion and determined a more accurate value for the constant that now bears his name. Hubble inferred the recession velocity of the objects from their redshifts, many of which were earlier measured and related to velocity by Vesto Slipher in 1917.   Figure 2: Georges LemaîtreImage source:Wikipedia .   Figure 3: Edwin HubbleImage source:Britannica .   Figure 4: Fred HoyleImage source:The Guardian . The law is often expressed by the equation: v = H0D  (1) where, v is the recessional velocity, typically expressed in km/s. H0 is Hubble’s constant and corresponds to the value of H (often termed the Hubble parameter which is a value that is time-dependent and which can be expressed in terms of the scale factor) in the Friedmann equations taken at the time of observation denoted by the subscript 0. This value is the same throughout the universe for a given comoving time. D is the proper distance (which can change over time, unlike the comoving distance, which is constant) from the galaxy to the observer, measured in megaparsecs (Mpc), in the 3-space defined by given cosmological time. The reciprocal of H0 is the Hubble time. This constant term H0 help us to estimate the age of the universe. Let me now discuss in brief how it does so. Age of the Universe: When Einstein, Lemaitre, and others solved the equations of general relativity, they were able to describe how the size of the universe has changed with time. Astronomers use the symbol R to represent the scale or size of the universe at any time. You can think of R as the size of the universe, but more accurately it represents the distance between any two well-separated places. The cosmological principle says that any two points are moving apart at the same rate. Thus, the entire history of the universe is described by the way that R varies with time. Since the universe is expanding, R has been continuously increasing for billions of years. Remember that R describes the expansion of space that carries galaxies apart — the galaxies themselves are not expanding. Galaxies are just markers of expanding space. The Big Bang model even provides a prediction for the age of the universe. If we imagine the evolving universe as a movie, the birth of the universe is the time in the distant past when all matter and radiation was crushed in a state of infinite temperature and density. The scale factor, R, was zero. Space had not yet begun to unfold. There are three ways to constrain the age of the universe. But in many ways, looking at the expansion rate of the universe is one of the easiest ways to figure out the universe’s age. This technique looks at the current expansion rate and then running it backwards to determine when today’s universe must have been compressed down to a single point. Mathematically, the age of the universe is: t0 = 1 / H0f (Ωr Ωm Ωλ;…)  (2) Where t0 is the current age, H0 is the current expansion rate, and f is a correction that takes into consideration the mass, energy, and other characteristics of the universe. For this method to work, you need to not only know the current expansion rate but also how this rate has changed over time due to the effects of gravity and the effect of dark energy (Ωλ;), which is pushing the universe apart. The best published value for the expansion rate is H0=70. 6 ± 3. 1 (km/sec) / Mpc. This means that every Megaparsec of space expands roughly 70. 6 km each second. Based on stellar evolution models, we estimate the oldest globular star clusters are between 11 and 13 billion years old. Apart from these two techniques, the most trusted means of determining the age of the universe comes from very precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The CMB is a diffuse, uniform background of microwave radiation that comes from all directions in the sky. This CMB is the electromagnetic radiation which is the remnant from an early stage of the universe, also known as relic radiation. First observed accidentally by the radio engineers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson in 1965, CMB is a crucial piece of evidence that supports the big bang model for the origin of the universe. Three space missions, in particular, have been instrumental in measuring this radiation in finer and finer detail and with better and better precision. NASA’s Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) took data from 1989 to 1996 and it was the first to detect tiny variations in the intensity of the radiation. Next came the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), launched by NASA in 2001. WMAP took data for a decade and its very accurate measurements put constraints on a set of parameters of the big bang model. The current state-of-the-art experiment is ESA’s Planck mission, launched in 2009. The level of accuracy of Planck data is tens of thousands of times greater than the discovery measurements of Penzias and Wilson. Based on the WMAP measurements and theoretical models, the universe is estimated to be 13. 82 ± 0. 12 billion years old. This is the most quoted age used by astronomers and is consistent with both other measurements within their errors. Remarkably, you can see that this value is very close to what has been estimated using the Hubble constant in equation 2. Conclusion: Very early in the history of mankind, ignorance of nature and fear of the unknown naturally made men religious. So God played a central role in primitive societies. They tried to answer every question with the help of God. As time passed, with experience and intellect men could understand more and more of the natural phenomenon. I have mentioned in my previous article that if one looks at the long march of human understanding, one will find that science begins with the idea that we can understand our role in the universe using logic and observation. Today humans have come a long way. And mathematics has truly acted as the most essential weapon in almost every known field, including astronomy. By now any reader will understand that in these two articles, I’ve discussed in brief how mathematics in simple form also has helped in the development of astronomy and human knowledge as a whole.

    "title": "Futuristic gravitational wave observations to resolve dichotomy of compact objects",
    "body": "2021/12/19 -  Gravitational waves are invisible ripples in space travel at the speed of light. It is generated in different scenarios, such as when two celestial bodies orbit around each other, an isolated body with tri-axial symmetry spins, inhomogeneity in matter distribution in the early universe, etc. Gravitational-wave astronomy aims to study these waves to improve the understanding of objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, events such as supernovae, and processes including those of the early universe shortly after the Big Bang. The article describes how futuristic gravitational wave observatories can be used to resolve the dichotomy of compact objects.  Historically, astronomy primarily relies on electromagnetic radiation. Over the past hundred years, various interesting astronomical objects have been discovered with gamma-ray detectors to radio telescopes. In recent years, gravitational wave astronomy has opened a new window to probe various exciting objects, and we can now look into the universe from a very different perspective. LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave detectors have so far made tens of detections from the merger of various compact objects. These are ground-based detectors operating at frequencies more than 1 Hz. As time progresses, these detectors have been upgraded continuously to increase their sensitivities so that we can look objects residing at further distances. Moreover, around 2035, a space-based gravitational wave mission, LISA is planned to launch, which would operate at less than 1 Hz frequency. Many interesting objects such as galactic binaries, massive binaries, extreme mass ratio inspirals, etc. , emit gravitational radiation at less than 1 Hz frequencies. Hence the current ground-based detectors cannot detect these objects, and LISA is planned to probe them. It is important to note that none of these objects are isolated in nature. Recently, a group of researchers have claimed that LISA might detect some isolated compact objects too. The term compact objects primarily represent white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. White dwarfs are the end state of stars with mass less than (10&#177;2) M⊙, where M⊙ ~2 x 1030 kg is the mass of the sun, in which the hydrogen fusion has stopped. One such object is the super-Chandrasekhar white dwarf. Over the past couple of decades, various researchers have detected more than a dozen over-luminous type Ia supernovae. Based on these observations, they have inferred that these supernovae have to be originated from massive white dwarfs, which violate the standard Chandrasekhar mass limit of 1. 4 M⊙. As a result, these objects are often termed as super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs. It has been shown that if a white dwarf possesses strong magnetic fields at the center, such white dwarfs can indeed hold mass more than 1. 4 M⊙. Moreover, if such a white dwarf rotates in such a way that there is a misalignment between its magnetic and rotation axes, it can emit continuous gravitational waves. These researchers have explicitly shown that if a white dwarf has a strong central field but a weaker field at its surface, LISA can detect it within 1 year of detection period. On the other hand, if the white dwarf possesses a strong surface field or a weak central field, LISA will not be able to detect it. However, such white dwarfs can be detected by some other futuristic detectors, such as BBO, DECIGO, etc. In this way, LISA can directly confirm the existence of super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs (Fig. 1). Note that signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is proportional to the square root of observation time (T) such that S/N increases with the observation time and the signal is more likely to be detected (see Section 1. 4 of Sieniawska &amp; Bejger, 2019, Universe 5, 217). This likeliness of detection is due to the increase in observation period and not due to the increase in sensitivity of the detectors. If S/N &GreaterEqual; 5, such a signal can be detected by a gravitational wave detector (see Section~2. 1 of Pitkin, 2011, MNRAS, 415, 1849).   (a) Poloidally dominated white dwarf.   (b) Toroidally dominated white dwarf Figure 1: Gravitational wave S/N as a function of integration time for a white dwarf with central density= 2 × 1010 g cm−3. The thick orange line corresponds to &lt;S/N&gt; ≈ 5. Gravitational wave astronomy is also helpful to resolve the dichotomy of some other objects too. There are some isolated compact objects, named soft gamma repeater~(SGR) and anomalous X-ray pulsar~(AXP), which are mostly believed to be neutron stars as they are found to be associated with supernova remnants. However, some of them do not have a supernova remnant association, and their magnetic field is also unknown. Hence, some researchers have also shown that some of their features can be explained assuming they are white dwarfs. To resolve this controversy, the researchers have shown that gravitational wave astronomy is also a helpful tool. It was shown that if they are neutron stars, no proposed gravitational wave detector can detect them. On the other hand, if they are white dwarfs, they can be detected by BBO and DECIGO detectors within 1 year of detection period. The exact time needed for the detection is dependent on the magnetic field configuration and its strength (Fig. 2).   (a) Poloidally dominated white dwarf.

For part (c), in the parentheses, the dominant magnetic field configuration in neutron star is mentioned. In this way, gravitational wave astronomy will be a useful tool to resolve dichotomy related to various compact objects.

    "title": "Most Extreme Stars",
    "body": "2021/12/12 -  A general article exploring some of the most extreme stars of the universe. Each one of them deserves the word ‘most’ for varied reasons. Just read and enjoy the mysterious cosmos sitting at home.  Introduction: The splendor of the night sky has fascinated mankind since time immemorial. The divine beauty of the numerous twinkling stars caught the attention of the human beings since the ancient historic periods. I was also not an exception. I have loved the stars since childhood days. I watch them, observe their properties, research some of them and also like to write about them. The stars are not only for the astronomers, it is for all of us. In fact, recent advances in astronomy have proved that – “we are all Star Childs. ” Yes, it may seem unbelievable to anybody who is not aware about astronomy, but it’s true that the elements with which we all and everything around us (like the chair, table, rockets, food, all animals etc. ) are made of, were once created inside the centers of the stars. There are as many different kinds of stars, as there are stars themselves, each an individual. The nature of these stars, understanding their properties and evolution tell us the story of our own existence - the birth and death of the Sun on which we all depend. So, once in a sky observation camp at Murguma, Purulia district, West Bengal of India during the chill cold nights of November, 2007, I suddenly started thinking about the most extreme stars – the record holders in the stellar worlds! Within a year, I collected the details of more than 100 of such stars. Let us discuss about some of them today. After much hard work of about a month, I have selected 14 of them to talk. Though these are my personal favorites, I am sure some of my favorites will become yours also. Enough of introduction, now let’s dive into the bizarre worlds of the most extreme stars and try to appreciate the immense range of sparkling night sky beauties that nature has to offer. Stars of Extreme properties: 1. ADHARA: The brightest ultra violet star of the sky known till now.   Fig. 1: AdharaImage courtesy: astropixels The Northern Hemisphere constellation Canis Major is mainly appreciated for the star “Sirius” – the apparently brightest star of the night sky. But just near it twinkles another second magnitude (visual mag:- 1. 51) star – Adhara. Situated at a distance of around 425 light years it marks the western foot of the mythical ‘Great Dog’ – Canis Major. Though we may neglect Adhara, but it is about 50 times further than Sirius – and still a bright second magnitude star. It is visually about 3700 times brighter than the Sun. But when we consider the ultraviolet radiation radiated from its surface, it is about 15,000 times brighter than our Sun! The radius of Adhara is about 13 times that of the Sun. It has left the main sequence stage and started its journey towards death. Combining these properties it has gained the status to be the brightest ultraviolet star of the sky as seen from Earth. So, if we could have seen in the ultraviolet band of the EM spectrum, Adhara would have been the brightest star of the night sky – not apparently but absolutely! 2. BARNARD’S STAR: The fastest moving star of the sky known Located in the constellation Ophiuchus and at a distance of 6 light years – Barnard’s star is one of the closest stars to Earth. Its visual magnitude is 9. 5 and is too dim to be observed by naked eye.   Fig. 2: Location of Barnard's Star, ca. 2006 (south is up)Image courtesy: Wikipedia As all the stars of our galaxy go around the Milky Way galaxy on slightly different orbits, their positions change relative to each other. Such motions are extremely slow andare known as the ‘proper motion’ of stars. These motions are so slow that they are just unnoted and their positions change over a time longer than the history of the printed world. But discovered in 1916 by E. E. Barnard, Barnard’s star moves across the sky at a tremendous speed of 10 seconds of arc per year. Over an average human lifetime, it will move by two – tenths of a degree – almost half the angular diameter of the Full Moon. This may seem incredibly small to anyone reading this article. But it is a celestial record!! Barnard’s star is the fastest moving star known till date. It will leave Ophiucus for Hercules (on its way to Draco) in about the next 3300 years. When translated to a linear scale, its speed is measured as 140 kms per second – about seven times the speed of an average star. We need a modest telescope and a good star map to observe this ‘Usain Bolt’ of the starry sky. Just try to watch it once. 3. CD - 380 245: The most metal poor star known Located at a distance of about 5000 light years in the Southern Hemisphere constellation ‘Sculptor’ this star was first catalogued during the ‘Southern Hemisphere’ sky survey during 1885 to 1930 at the Cordoba Observatory in Argentina. The catalogue of these stars is known as CD. Our star’s bizarre name CD – 380 245 means that it is the 245th star within the band that lies between 380 and 390 South ‘declination’ in the ‘CD’ catalogue. CD – 380 245 is a record holder due to one of its mind-boggling property. It is the most metal poor star known! Due to its extremely low metal abundance, it becomes difficult to classify this star in a spectral classification scheme. From its spectrum, its iron content is measured to be about ten – thousandth of that of the Sun! It is also one of the oldest known stars. The Universe was created by an event called Big Bang. It is thought that the Big Bang event created only Hydrogen, Helium and very less amount of Lithium. So, the first stars (i. e. the oldest stars) that formed after Big Bang should have very less metal content. But the point is - we do not find much of these types of metal–poor stars. The question is: where are these first generation stars? Thus, we see that CD – 380 245 not only holds a record, but points to a deep mystery. It is really one of those rare, very old stars whom you can call; hello, the stellar Grandfather! 4. ESO 439 – 26: The faintest known White Dwarf When low mass (0. 8 – 2. 5 Solar mass) or intermediate mass (about &lt; 9 Solar mass) stars die, their carbon–oxygen core become exposed. These end states of low and medium mass stars are called white dwarfs – as they are very hot (so, white) and of very small size (like that of Earth) with diameter of about 10,000 kms (so, dwarf). The density of white dwarfs are extremely large – one sugar cube size mass of a white dwarf will weigh a ton! These white dwarfs are by nature very faint. Generally maximum white dwarfs are spotted in near distances (as we cannot see them at great distances due to their faintness) like the disks of our Galaxy. Their average absolute magnitude is about 16. But our star – ES0 439-269, located at a distance of about 140 light years in Hydra constellation, has an absolute magnitude of 17. 4. This makes it the faintest known white dwarf less than one hundredth the apparent brightness of Pluto! But, just wait friends…May be it is the faintest – but not the coolest. As we may expect that the faintest white dwarfs will also be the coolest ones – not true for ESO 439-26. It’s surface temperature (4560K) is warmer than the current record of 3500 K (surface temperature) for a bit brighter companionWDO 346+246 – the coolest known white dwarf. So you see, our general assumptions about nature does not always hold. 5. Gamma – 2 Velorum: A double star with the brightest known Wolf Rayet star Also called ‘Ragor’, this star is located about 840 light years away in the constellation Vela. With a visual magnitude of 1. 78 it is visually about 11,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Moreover, it is a double star. The components take 76 days to orbit each other and are completely inseparable except by means of sophisticated interferometry. Its spectrum depicts that one of the component is a Wolf Rayet (WR) star. WR stars were discovered by French astronomers Charles Wolf and Georges Rayet in the nineteenth century. The most striking property of WR stars is that they do not contain hydrogen - the main content of any other type of main sequence star! WR stars are very hot, rare, extremely luminous, and superbly blue in color. They are also losing mass madly. The type of WR star which we are concerned is a ‘WC’ star. It is one of the two kinds of WR stars. WC stars shine the spectra of helium and carbon. Our Gamma – 2 Velorum consist a WC star. Its estimated surface temperature is around 50,000 K. Though it is brilliantly luminous in the visual band of the EM spectrum, its most of the radiation is in ultraviolet spectrum. If all the radiation is combined, this WC star (a component of the double star of Gamma – 2 Velorum) is around 50,000 – 1,00,000 times more luminous than the Sun!This is the brightest WR star known till date. The WC star has lost almost 20 - 30 times the mass of Sun since its birth and till loses mass at a rate of nearly a ten – thousandth of a solar mass per year. This rate is just horrific. It is around 1 billion (100,00,00,000) times the flow in the solar wind. This wind of the WC star carries out the carbon that was created through helium fusion. The carbon enriches the nearby stellar environment from where new stars may born in distant future. Just think a bit. We can see the primary process which ultimately forms new stars, then may be planets around it and then may be life timming in one of those distant future planets. This particular star thus gives us the flavor of star formation process to be witnessed. Moreover, this star is visible through naked eye from any place south of 400N latitude in the constellation Vela during any suitable time of the year. It is designated as ‘Spectral Gem of the Southern Skies’. 6. Geminga: A weird radio-quiet Gamma Ray pulsar A massive star (9 - 25 Solar mass) dies in a violent supernova explosion leaving behind a highly magnetized, extremely dense and small (around only 15 - 20 kms diameter) core made up of completely neutrons. This dead core is called a neutron star. It spins extremely fast (many times per second). As a neutron star spins, its magnetic axis wobbles. It radiates energy along this magnetic axis which is titled to its rotational axis. If the Earth is in the way of such a magnetic axis of any neutron star, then we receive a shot of energy or ‘pulses’ from that particular neutron star. This is why; neutron stars are also called “pulsars” . The magnetic fields of pulsars are about 100 million times that of earth’s magnetic fields. The pulsars spin so fast and energetically that they radiate not only in radio waves, but also in the optical, x-ray and even in high energy gamma-ray domains. These pulses originate from the magnetic fields through the energy of rotation of the pulsars. As pulsars become older, they lose energy and also pulses from top down. The high-energy gamma ray pulses first vanish, then gradually disappear x-ray and optical and at last they are left with only radio pulses.   Fig. 3: GemingaImage courtesy: ESA But every radio astronomer got shocked in the year 1973. In 1973, an object was found in the constellation Gemini which was a bright gamma–ray source. More precise observations showed that it is pulsing at x-ray energies with a period of 0. 237 seconds (4. 2 times per second). It was named “Geminga”. Located 800 light years away, the field of the sky showed few stars when photographed. After much tenuous research, one very dim star (visual apparent magnitude 25. 5) was identified as “Geminga”. The bizarre thing is that it is a pulsar which is radiating only high energy gamma rays and x-rays, not in optical and not even in radio! Its surface temperature is between 2,00,000-3,00,000 K and the age is estimated at around 3,40,000 years. It is the first known Gamma-Ray pulsar and extremely rare in its breed. Where are the radio waves? Is it really not emitting any radio emission? Or, is there something else? The answers to all these questions is,“Nobody knows”…Just think about “Geminga” which literally means ‘not there’! 7. HD93129A: Probably the most luminous star The Southern Hemisphere sky has a spectacular constellation (other than crux the Southern Cross) to watch-Carina. It contains Eta-Carinae: the most massive confirmed star in our Galaxy. Also it has another wonder not quite visible to the naked eye (visual magnitude 7. 3):- HD93129A - possibly the most luminous star of the Galaxy. This star is the luminary of a young dense cluster known as Trumpler 14 which is situated around 9000 light years away. It is a member of a binary system. Both it and its companion (HD93129B) is O3 star. Our star HD93129A, which is a supergiant, has an absolute magnitude of -6. 7. If it was as close as the bright star Vega, it would have been far brighter than Venus. The two stars are estimated to have an orbit of at least 50,000 years.   Fig. 4: HD93129AImage courtesy: windows2universe Now look for its luminosity. With surface temperature of about 52,000 K it pours most of its radiation in the ultraviolet range. Combining all types of radiation, it is around 25, 00,000 (2. 5 million) times brighter than Sun—somewhat less than Eta Carinae. But there is a catch. It has been revealed that about 1. 7 magnitudes of its radiation are absorbed by intervening interstellar dust between it and us. If this absorption would not have absorbed HD93129A’s radiation and considering the huge uncertainties in distance, it could in fact top Eta Carinae’s luminosity. Its birth mass may have been greater than 120 solar masses. To orbit this star and receive the same radiation as we receive from the Sun on Earth, out Earth would have to be at a distance of 1600A. U away from the star i. e. 40 times the distance between Pluto and Sun. If the companion B star was not there, this hypothetical earth would take about 4800 years to complete one orbit. Just think of a severe harsh winter of 1200 years with temperature falling well below -200 degree Celsius! 8. ETA CARINAE: The most massive known confirmed star in our Galaxy   Fig. 5: Hubble Space Telescope image showing Eta Carinae and the bipolar Homunculus Nebula. Image courtesy: Wikipedia Almost 8000 light years away in the constellation Carina lays a monster of the stellar world—Eta Carinae. One of the farthest visible naked eye star (apparent magnitude 5. 0), it is around 50,00,000 times brighter than the Sun and buried in a dense cloud of its own making (the ‘Homunculus’ nebula as it is called ). It is an extremely violent star which became brighter than Vega (app. mag-1) in 1840 due to a massiveeruption. Again shining to sixth magnitude in 1890, it faded away later and recently has become visible to the naked eye. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) revealed that the Homunculus is made of two oppositely moving (speed 400 kms/second) lobes nearly a light year across. They were created in the Great Eruption of 1840. The star’s terrific luminosity suggests a present mass of around 100 solar masses making it the most massive known confirmed star in our Galaxy. Modern observations in the nebular spectral lines also suggest a 5. 6 years orbit pointing to the fact that may be Eta Carinae is a massive binary star system. Current estimates tell that the “primary” star has a mass of around 80 solar mass and the “secondary” has around 60 solar mass. The two may have been born with 200 solar mass. Recently in 2010, a star named R136a1 has been discovered in the ‘Tarantula Nebula’ of our nearby galaxy ‘Large Magellanic Cloud’. It is estimated to have a present mass of around 260-265 solar mass and is thought to have been born with about 320 solar masses! Though it is under close scrutiny till now, if the mass revealed is true then this will be surely the most massive star known till now. 9. R LEPORIS: The sky’s reddest naked eye star Have you seen the constellation Lepus (the Hare) just below Orion? Perhaps some of you know it for the blazing globular cluster M79. But leave M79, Lepus contains a record holding star in it – R Leporis or Hind’s Crimson star discovered by J. R. Hind in 1845. It is a long period variable like ‘Mira’ changing its brightness over a long 430 days period by a factor of 300 (visual magnitude 5. 5 to 11. 7). Located at a distance of about 820 light years and still to be a ‘Mira’ type variable, R Leporis must be a cool giant. Cool stars are reddish (recall Betelgeuse, Antares). It is 300 times more luminous than the Sun. But as it is a cool star, it emits mainly in the infrared region.   Fig. 6: The superb red color of R LeporisImage courtesy: NASA There are two factors which contribute to its extreme red color. First it has exceptionally low surface temperature of about 2050K, making it one of the coolest giants known. Second, R Leporis is an arch ‘carbon star’. It is now a full blown carbon star. Injecting this carbon into interstellar space R Leporis is gradually forming a planetary nebula. Carbon molecules (mainly cyanogen) absorb a huge amount of blue light. So the more amount of carbon and the cooler the star, more and more blue light is absorbed. Thus, carbon stars are very red in colour. R Leporis, due to its extremely low surface temperature takes this redness to the highest limit. It is the reddest naked eye star of the sky!!Most of the carbon in our Galaxy seems to come from stars like this one. Every one of us is made of stellar dust which was parts of such long gone stars! 10. VV CEPHEI: The largest known star About 2000 light years away, in the constellation Cepheus lays a 4. 91 visual magnitude (absolute mag – 6. 75) M2 class supergiant star VV Cephei. It can dwarf any other known star in the sky due its massive size i. e. radius. It is the largest known star considering its radius. Being a part of a binary system its companion is a hot dwarf star whose spectral class is not properly known. Having a surface temperature of around 3,300 K, this super giant primary star VV Cephei has a luminosity of around 315000 times that of the Sun. From these properties, the radius of this star derived is about 8. 0 A. U i. e. 85 percent the size of the orbit of Saturn!!   Fig. 7: Size comparison of VV Cephei A with our SunImage courtesy: StarDate As it is a part of an eclipsing binary system, its companion dwarf star hides itself every 20. 2 years behind this M supergiant. These orbital studies predict the approximate radius of the supergiant M star to be 8. 8 A. U. Even a conservative analysis yields 7. 4 A. U. This grand supergiant’s size is roughly half the size of its companion star’s orbit! Both the stars are estimated to have 20 solar masses. VV Cephei is closely followed in the size race by another supergiant (this time a single, not binary) in the same Cepheus constellation: MU Cephei (also called Herschel’s Garnet star). It is the second largest known star with a radius of about 7 A. U i. e. 40 percent larger than Jupiter’s orbit. Its visual magnitude is 4. 1 and lies just a bit south of VV Cephei. So both the largest and second largest known stars of the sky can be seen through naked eye. 11. ACHERNAR: The flattest known star   Fig. 8: Location of Achernar in Eridanus ConstellationImage courtesy: astronomytrek The constellation Eridanus starting from just below the brightest star of Orion i. e. ‘Rigel’ is a large constellation with many famous stars. It stretches through the sky towards south and ends at a bright star named Achernar- the brightest star of Eridanus. Not only this, Achernar is also the flattest star known till date! Having an apparent magnitude of 0. 5 and at a distance of 143 light years it is rotating at a tremendous speed. This caused an appreciable equatorial bulge. Across its equator it is 55% wider than across its poles. Thus, the star’s equatorial regions are less dense and cooler than the areas near the poles. This phenomenon is called ‘gravity darkening’. Being a very bright star, it is easily observable through naked eye. This makes it a very rare celestial beauty- one of the very few stars in the sky with gravity darkening effect that can be observed easily with unaided eyes.   Fig. 9: Achernar: the flattest star knownImage courtesy: astronomytrek 12. SGR 1900 + 14: Ultra –Magnetic neutron star that ionized the earth’s atmosphere Looking at the beautiful sparkling stars far away from us, please do not think that they cannot create any harm to us from such huge distances. They can really reach us and show how excessively powerful they are- and how extremely helpless and insignificant we are compared to them!One such major caution came on August 27, 1998 at 10:22 Greenwich Mean time (i. e. 15. 52 P. M. IST) from a distance of about 20,000 light years in the direction of Aquila constellation. A newly formed pulsar is so dense that it develops a solid crust that re-adjusts as its rotation rate slows. The equator is bulged out due to its fast rotation. During this readjusting phase, severe star quakes take place releasing immense energy. The bursts of this power can be unbelievable. Some of these pulsars emit relatively low energy gamma rays that last about a hundredth of a second. Such pulsars are called ‘Soft Gamma ray Repeaters’ or in short ‘SGR’. SGRs are very rare – only four have been found in our Galaxy till now. Two of them, SGR 1806-20 and our one i. e. SGR 1900 + 14 are well studied. SGRs are not only neutron stars – they are radio quiet pulsars like ‘Geminga’. SGR 1900+14 carries pulses of period 5. 16 seconds. In 1992, theoreticians suggested that some supernovae can create neutron stars with unimaginable magnetic strengths, if conditions are correct. They are called ‘magnetars’. The more powerful the magnetic field, the greater the slowing down rate of their spin. The above mentioned two SGRs are actually magnetars with magnetic fields 500 billion times that of the Earth. They carry the strongest magnetic fields of the universe!!But the story does not stop here. On August 27, 1998 at 10. 22 GMT, the magnetar SGR 1900+14 blasted an immense amount of energy towards us - 500,00,00,000 (five billion) times the energy produced by Sun per second. The intense energy radiated from this tremendous outburst immediately saturated the electronics aboard orbiting spacecrafts. Also our atmosphere got terribly affected! The ionosphere we know about is at a height of around 85 kms from Earth’s surface during night time. During day, sunlight ionizes the air and as a result the ionosphere comes to a height of around 60 kms from Earth’s surface. The outburst from SGR 1900+14 drove the ionosphere from the standard night time level to its standard day time level! SGR 1900+14 is 20,000 light years away. If it would have been 100 light years away- the earth would have been shattered within seconds!SGR 1900+14 showed the gigantic powers that stars can posses. It also taught us- “Earth is not at all a safe place from the sudden dangers of deep space. ”So you see, the twinkling stars of the sky are not only mere dots, they can reach to us and even touch us!! 13. OGLE – TR – 122B: Smallest known main sequence star whose radius is measured Come to the southern constellation Carina again. Though not visible through naked eyes, it contains another star which is a record breaker among the stellar world. It is OGLE-TR-122B – the smallest known main sequence star whose radius is measured. Being a part of a binary system, this star was spotted by a sophisticated survey called OGLE i. e. Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. It has a radius which is only about 20% larger than Jupiter – around 1, 80,000 kms only (our Sun’s radius is 7, 00,000 kms). Its radius is about only 0. 12 times the solar radii and mass about 0. 1 solar masses. Thus, the average density is about 50 times that of the sun.   Fig. 10: Size Comparison of OGLE-TR-122B with our Sun &amp; JupiterImage courtesy: newscientist OGLE-TR-122B has a mass which is close to the lowest possible mass a star can possess for starting hydrogen fusion in its core. It is truly a ‘Little Master’ of the sky, so little that it is a record holder little one. 14. Epsilon Aurigae: The most unusual variable star system known Epsilon Aurigae (ε-Aurigae) is a star in the constellation of Auriga. It is one of the most mysterious variable star known till now. Traditionally known as Almaaz, Haldus or Al Anz, it is a completely unusual eclipsing binary system which consists of a F0 class supergiant star and a companion whose proper identity is unknown till now. This star is of utter interest due to the nature of its eclipse. Every 27 years, Epsilon Aurigae’s apparent visual magnitude (i. e. brightness) starts to drop down from +2. 92, and within a period of 640-730 days (about 2 years) the magnitude drops to +3. 83. Then gradually again the brightness starts increasing due to the end of the eclipse. Also within those 2 years of eclipse process, in addition to this eclipse, the system has a low amplitude pulsation with a non consistent period of about 66 days. Epsilon Aurigae is an easily visible naked eye star of the sky. But it was the German astronomer Johann Fritsch who first suspected it to be a variable star in 1821. Later observations of Edward Heis and Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander during 1842-1848 confirmed the fact. By their observations it was revealed that ε Aurigae did not just vary over a long period (640-730 days), but also experienced short term variations in brightness as well. We know that our Moon sometimes eclipses the Sun completely (Total Solar Eclipse). This eclipse time can be up to a maximum of 7 minutes and 29 seconds. But in case of Epsilon Aurigae, the companion object which eclipses the star goes on eclipsing it for a continuous 640-730 days. Also this unknown companion does not emit as much radiation (or light) as expected for an object of such a huge size which can eclipse a supergiant star for 640-730 days! Then what this companion object can be? What is its nature and properties?This unseen, unknown companion and the mysterious eclipse pattern of the star system have made this star the most unusual, debatable variable star of the sky. The distance of this system from the Earth is also a subject of debate, but modern astronomers place it about 2000 light years from Earth. This eclipsing component is the center for all attraction today. No one knows properly the nature of the eclipsing component. It emits very negligible amount of light and thus remains invisible to the naked eye. A heated region has been discovered at the center of this object. The last eclipse of ε-Aurigae started in the International Year of Astronomy: 2009. So, AAVSO (American Association for Variable Star Observation) started a project called Citizen Sky to observe and report the data of this star system. Trained participants also analyzed data while testing their own theories. It was a three year project funded by National Science Foundation which can shed light to the mystery of the star system. The eclipse ended on May 12, 2011. Data was submitted by around 400 observers all over the world.   Fig. 11: The dimming of Epsilon Aurigae with course of time after the start of eclipseImage courtesy: Wikipedia Many probable theories and hypothesis concerning the nature of this object have come forward. But till now the mystery remains an unsolved mystery. The true nature of the eclipsing component is still a matter of debate. Conclusion: After a journey through the bizarre stellar beauties, one can understand that they are not only tiny twinkling dots in the sky- all of them have a story to tell. Next time when you look towards a clear night sky studded with all these small dots, which we call stars, just think about their amazing powers, extreme size, devastating eruptions from them, unbelievable luminosities and so on. You will surely become quiet, speechless and feel an unearthly peace in mind. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. "

    "title": "Magnetic Field Measurements of the Solar Corona by Aditya L1",
    "body": "2021/12/07 -  One of the science goals of the Aditya L1 is to map the coronal magnetic field topology. The infrared channel of the VELC payload of the Aditya L1 is equipped with a spectropolarimeter to perform full stokes spectropolarimetric observations in the Fe XIII 1074. 7 nm line to measure the vector magnetic field. This article discusses the design and the working of the spectropolarimeter of the VELC. This article also discusses the challenges associated with the spectropolarimeter of the VELC, which are to optimize the data volume to be sent to the ground as no onboard data processing is planned, and the other is to account for the change in polarimeter characteristic due to mismatch in retarder rotation frequency and the length of signal detection time.  Aditya L1 is the first Indian space-based Solar observatory that will continuously observe the Sun to study coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, coronal magnetometry, origin, and monitoring of near-UV solar radiation. It is equipped with seven payloads. One of the payloads is Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC), developed by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) to study the diagnostic parameters of solar corona and dynamics and origin of Coronal Mass Ejections and magnetic field measurement of the solar corona. A coronagraph is a telescopic instrument that blocks the light of a star so that the nearby objects which would otherwise be hidden in the star’s glare be resolved. A solar coronagraph occults the bright solar disc to resolve the corona. The VELC is equipped with a spectrograph as a backend instrument. A spectrograph disperses the polychromatic light and records the intensities over a range of wavelengths called the spectrum. We study the properties of the spectrum to estimate the plasma parameters like velocity, electron density, temperature, etc.   Figure 1: A LASCO C2 Coronagraph. LASCO consists of three coronagraphs (C1/C2/C3) onboard NASA’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory satellite. Image courtesy: NASA The VELC is designed to record spectra simultaneously in three spectral lines at 530. 3 nm due to Fe XIV (green channel), 789. 2 nm due to Fe XI (red channel), and 1074. 7 nm due to Fe XIII (IR channel). It is a multi-slit spectrograph (4 equispaced slits) covering the FOV up to 1. 5R⊙, where R⊙ is the radius of the Sun. The IR channel is equipped with a polarimeter to carry out full Stokes polarimetric observations of the Fe XIII line. The polarisation of electromagnetic waves refers to the path or the locus of the electric field vector. If the electric field oscillates in a single direction, it is called linear polarisation. If the electric field rotates in a circular plane as the light travels forward, it is called circular polarisation. The plasma’s magnetic field information is encoded in the polarisation of the spectral lines via the Zeeman effect and the Hanle effect. The Zeeman effect is the splitting of the spectral line in the presence of an external magnetic field. The Zeeman splitting of the spectral line gives rise to three spectral components, 𝞼+, 𝞼-, and 𝜋 components, which are right circularly polarised, left circularly polarised, and linearly polarised, respectively. If the magnetic field is along the line of sight, in that case, only the 𝞼+, 𝞼- components are observed. If the magnetic field is perpendicular to the line of sight (LOS), all three components are observed as linearly polarised. Also, the separation between these components, an observable quantity, is directly related to the magnitude of the magnetic field. Hence by measuring the polarisation in spectral lines, we can estimate both the magnitude and the direction of the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere.   Figure 2: Subfigure (a) shows the break in the degeneracy between magnetic sublevels in the presence of an external magnetic field, and this break or split of the levels produces three spectral components (𝞼+, 𝞼-, and 𝜋). In subfigure (b), we see if the magnetic field is perpendicular to LOS, then 𝞼+, 𝞼-, and 𝜋 components are observed as linearly polarized. In the subfigure (c), the magnetic field direction is into the plane of the screen (i. e. , along the line of sight), therefore only 𝞼+, 𝞼- components are observed as right and left circularly polarized respectively. Image courtesy: Author The Hanle effect is observed when the splitting or separation between energy levels of a spectral line, in the presence of an external magnetic field, is less than or equal to the natural width of that line. The anisotropic radiation coming from the underlying photosphere or chromosphere gets scattered by the atoms in the upper layers like the transition region and corona (TR-corona). This scattering process leads to linear polarization of the emitted spectral lines. This is valid even when there is no external magnetic field. Now, in the weak magnetic field regions such as TR-corona (where expected field strength is 1 to 300 Gauss), there will be a modification of the scattering or linear polarization as well as rotation of the plane of linear polarization of the emitted lines. This effect of modification in the line polarization is called the Hanle effect. By measuring this change in the polarization of the lines, the weak magnetic field can be estimated in the TR-corona of the sun. As described above, we can estimate the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere by measuring the polarization in spectral lines. A polarimeter is an instrument used to measure polarization. A polarimeter consists of a polarization modulator and a linear polarizer/analyzer. First, the unpolarized light from the Sun enters the polarization modulator which changes the state of input polarization. Then the polarized light from the modulator enters the linear polarizer which cuts the intensity of light perpendicular to its orientation. Hence, we measure at the detector the intensity allowed by the linear polarizer, which in turn depends on the output from the polarization modulator, which in turn depends on the polarization state of the input light of the Sun. By measuring at the detector the output intensity of the incident light of the Sun through the polarimeter and knowing the characteristics of the polarimeter, we can estimate the input polarization.   Figure 3: Figure showing a Retarder acting as a Polarization Modulator and Linear polarizer acting as an analyzer. Image courtesy: Introduction to Spectropolarimetry The VELC polarimeter consists of a continuously rotating wave plate (RWP) followed by a polarizing beam displacer (PBD) as the polarization analyzer. The PBD produces two beams that are orthogonally polarized, which are simultaneously recorded by the detector. This setup is commonly known as a dual-beam polarimeter. The main advantage of dual-beam setup is to reduce the spurious polarisation, i. e. , cross-talk from Stokes I to Q, U, and V. The light enters the polarimeter setup (RWP + PBD), and a frame is recorded on the detector. Then RWP is rotated by an angle, and another frame is recorded. To measure the four Stokes parameters (I, Q, U, and V), a minimum of 4 such measurements, called samples, are required at different orientations of RWP. This is called modulation of the polarization state of light. One modulation cycle constitutes 4 samples per half rotation of the wave plate, so one complete rotation of the RWP provides 2 modulation cycles. Due to the limited number of photons in the solar corona, large integration times are required to build the required signal-to-noise ratio. Signal to noise ratio (SNR) is the ratio of the desired signal strength to the background noise level. When SNR is low, we need to add the signal for many time intervals (integration time), which adds up the signal and reduces or cancels the noise as the noise is assumed random. It poses several challenges concerning the polarimeter of the VELC. One of them is the increased data volume to be sent to the ground station as no on-board data processing is planned. The second is the change in the polarimeter characteristic. In typical polarimeters, first RWP rotates, then the detector frame is recorded, However, in the case of VELC, the RWP rotates, and the detector records independently of each other. There is a mismatch between the retarder’s rotation frequency and the length of the signal detection time, which causes a change in the characteristic of the polarimeter after one cycle of measurements. Nagaraju and the team discuss the above problems and suggest a potential solution to optimize the data volume and account for the change in polarimeter characteristics in successive modulation cycles. To optimize the data volume, Nagaraju and the team discuss the optimal efficiencies of measuring Stokes parameters as a function of the number of samples per half rotation (n) of the wave plate (RWP) and provide efficiencies when the retarder’s rotation frequency does not match the signal detection time. They find that efficiency slowly increases with an increase in the number of samples per half rotation of the wave plate. They find that the increase in efficiency of measuring Stokes I and Stokes U is close to 10% for the case of n=5 to n=95, for Stokes Q, it is about 8%, and for Stokes V, it is about 4%. However, as the number of samples per half rotation will increase from n=5 to n=95, the data size will proportionally increase, and this will offset any gains in efficiency. They estimate the data size of 3. 14 Mb per second for n=4 to 74. 19 Mb per second for n=95. Hence they suggest that the number of modulation steps or the samples per half rotation be chosen by considering the data volume and other measurement aspects.   Image courtesy: Original article Nagaraju and the team discuss the change in the elements of polarimeter characteristics with time to understand the effect of the mismatch between retarder rotation frequency and signal detection time. They model this change for the different number of samples per half rotation of the wave plate. They find a cyclical/periodic variation in the elements with time. They find that the larger the time difference between the retarder rotation frequency and signal detection time, the faster is the variation in the elements of polarimeter characteristics with time. Despite the significant variation in individual elements, the efficiency of measuring Stokes parameters does not change significantly throughout integration time. They suggest this change in the elements of the polarimeter characteristics can be taken into account through calibration. They notice that the elements corresponding to measuring Stokes Q and Stokes U vary two times faster than elements corresponding to measuring Stokes V. Hence, recording the calibration data to cover one entire cycle within which elements of polarimeter characteristics corresponding to measuring Stokes V complete one period of variation may suffice.   Image courtesy: Original article Hence, they find that the data volume can be optimized by choosing an appropriate number of samples per half rotation of the wave plate (RWP) without significantly affecting the efficiency of the Stokes parameters. The variation of elements of polarimeter characteristic with time is also addressed due to a mismatch between the retarder rotation frequency and signal detection time, and a potential solution is suggested.

    "title": "Identification of a new category of stars: stars in rare transition phase found",
    "body": "2021/12/03 -  Pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars evolve into the main-sequence (MS) phase over a period of time. Interestingly, we found a scarcity of studies in the existing literature that examine and attempt to better understand the stars in the PMS to MS transition phase. The purpose of this study is to detect such rare stars, which we named ‘transition phase’ (TP) candidates – stars evolving from the PMS to the MS phase. We identified 98 TP candidates using photometric analysis of a sample of 2167 classical Be (CBe) and 225 Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars. This identification is done by analyzing the near- and mid-infrared excess and their location in the optical colour–magnitude diagram. The TP candidates are found to possess rotational velocity and colour excess values in between CBe and HAeBe stars, which is reconfirmed by generating a set of synthetic samples using the machine learning approach.  Introduction: A clear night sky offers an ever-changing display of fascinating objects to see - the Moon, planets, stars, even a good number of star clusters and nebulae. Observing the night sky and studying it has a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. Modern science and present-day technology have certainly provided us the opportunity to view the universe in much depth, thus revealing the deep insights of different cosmic objects, which otherwise remained hidden from human eyes for centuries. We now have a pretty good understanding of the stars, their properties, and their evolution. It is known that the star formation of massive stars proceeds through well-studied, definitive stages such as the protostar and pre-main sequence phase, before reaching the main sequence. A protostar is a very young star that is still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud. The protostellar phase is the earliest one in the process of stellar evolution. For a low-mass star (i. e. that of the Sun or lower), it lasts about 500,000 years. In essence, this is the period of a star’s infancy. Next, Pre-main sequence (PMS) stars are those which are gradually attaining youth. Hydrogen fusion has not yet started in their cores, but the temperature is gradually rising. Loosely, we can say this is the child cum adolescent stage of a star. Later, when such PMS stars graduate to youth, we call them Main sequence (MS) stars. This is certainly the youth stage of stars where Hydrogen is fusing to helium in their cores, like our Sun.   Figure 1: On the left is a physico-mathematical model of the Be star Achernar, a main sequence star (Image courtesy: astronomytrek). The picture on the right captured by Atacama Large Millimeter array, is of HL Tauri, a pre-main sequence star. (Image courtesy: ESO). Pre-main sequence (PMS) stars evolve into the main sequence (MS) phase over a period of time. However, whether there exist stars that are in some transition phase between the PMS to MS stage remains an open question among astronomers. An understanding of the transition from the PMS to MS phase is vital to address the astrophysical aspects connected to disc dynamics and the rotation rate evolution of stars. Interestingly, a scarcity of studies is found in the existing literature that examines and attempts to better understand the stars in PMS to MS transition phase. This dearth of study naturally raises a few pertinent questions such as, ‘Why is such a scarcity in the studies of stars in the transition phase from PMS to MS?’ and ‘Which stellar parameter is a clear and definitive indicator to identify such candidates?’. In this context, we conducted a study in the work “Identification of emission-line stars in the transition phase from pre-main sequence to main sequence” to delve into such essential questions. Present Paper: Identification of emission-line stars in transition phase from pre-main sequence to main sequenceAim: As mentioned earlier, we found a scarcity of studies in the existing literature that examines and attempts to better understand the stars in the PMS to MS transition phase. The purpose of the present study is to detect such rare stars, which we named ‘Transition Phase’ (TP) candidates - stars evolving from the PMS to the MS phase. We identified 98 TP candidates using photometric analysis of a sample of 2167 classical Be (CBe) and 225 Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars. Both CBe and HAeBe examples of a rather uncommon class of stars known as ‘emission-line’ stars, which exhibit emission lines of several elements in their spectra. Emission-line stars: Stars usually show absorption lines in their optical spectra. However, there exist stars that also exhibit emission lines of different elements. Broadly known as ‘emission-line stars’, they belong to different categories such as T Tauri, Herbig Ae/Be, Of/ Oe/ Be/ Ae stars, Wolf Rayet (WR) stars, etc. Fig. 2 presents the representative spectra of one Be star HD 55606 showing different spectral features. A HAeBe star is an intermediate mass PMS star (between 2 and 8 times the mass of our Sun) with a gaseous disc surrounded by a dusty outer envelope (Waters &amp; Waelkens, 1998). On the other hand, a CBe star is a type of massive B-type main sequence star that is surrounded by a geometrically thin, equatorial, gaseous, decretion disc that orbits the star in Keplerian rotation (Meilland et al. , 2007). The existence of such a circumstellar, gaseous disc was first suggested by Struve (1931). One may read the article “Study of exotic Classical Be stars using optical spectroscopy” by Gourav Banerjee to know more about CBe stars and recent developments in the field of CBe star research.   Figure 2: Representative spectra of the star HD 55606 showing different spectral features in the wavelength range of 3800 – 5850 Å. Figure from Banerjee et al. (2021). The representative emission and absorption lines are indicated with arrows. Fig 3 shows the connection between absolute magnitude and spectral type of stars, which was not random but instead seemed to fall into discrete groupings, this figure is known as HR diagram or Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The enclosed regions in the illustration indicate the locations of various kinds of emission-line stars on the diagram. It is clear that emission-line stars are primarily concentrated in the region corresponding to early and late-type stars.   Figure 3: Distribution of different types of emission-line stars in the HR diagram. Figure is taken from Kogure &amp; Leung (2007). Brief summary: Some recent studies (e. g. Mathew et al. , 2008, Jamialahmadi et al. , 2015) presented convincing evidence that stars might possess an unseen and rare transition phase between PMS to MS. One reason why such stars remain unseen to date might be this: during the protostar and PMS phases, a star is usually surrounded by thick discs of dust and gas. This makes it difficult to observe such stars using ground based facilities. Mathew et al. (2008) studied 207 open clusters younger than 100 Myr and identified 152 CBe stars in 42 clusters. Interestingly, they also detected a few more stars that are situated in a region somewhere in between HAeBe and CBe stars in the near-IR color-color diagram. Fig. 4 presents the result which was observed by Mathew et al. (2008).   Figure 4: The diagram of 157 identified emission-line stars (open triangles) as found by Mathew et al. (2008). The known CBe stars (filled squares) and HBe stars (filled circles) are also shown in the figure. It is seen that a few stars are located in a region somewhere in between HBe and CBe stars. For representation purposes, the region containing the most concentration of CBe and HBe stars are marked with blue and red ellipses, respectively. The candidates which appear to fall in between these two regions are marked with a grey ellipse. This grey region constitutes stars which we termed as ‘Transition Phase' candidates. Then it was found by Jamialahmadi et al. (2015) that the star 51 Oph might be a probable example of this class of rare transition stars. According to them, ‘this star appears to be a peculiar source in an unusual transitional state’. This was the motivation for starting our ambitious research project. We analyzed a sample of 2167 CBe and 225 HAeBe stars. The main reason for selecting these two classes of stars is this: HAeBe stars are in the PMS phase, whereas CBe stars are in the MS stage. Hence, our selection helped us to detect those rare stars which are in the transition phase between HAeBe and CBe: meaning stars in between PMS and MS phase. Photometric analysis was performed on the sample of these HAeBe and CBe stars, which were obtained from the literature. Through developing machine learning and statistical technique and analysis, we were able to identify a sample of 98 stars evolving from PMS to MS phase (follow the paper for a detailed understanding of the methodology and analysis). This separate category of stars is termed as ‘Transition Phase’ (TP) candidates by the authors. They are likely to exhibit properties of both HAeBe and CBe stars. Interestingly, the detected 98 TP candidates are indeed found to possess rotational velocity in between CBe and HAeBe stars, which is reconfirmed by the machine learning approach. This provides compelling evidence that these stars might truly be passing through the rare transition phase between PMS and MS. Previous studies reported 14 among these 98 candidates to be HAeBe stars, whereas the other 84 were classified as CBe stars. We estimated the age and mass of 58 among the 98 TP candidates to be ranging within 0. 1-5 million years and 2-10. 5 times that of the Sun, respectively. However, the detailed properties of these newly identified stars are still unknown. Future Scope: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and also the largest study till date to detect and characterize TP candidates. Our study will motivate the community of emission-line star research about the significant need of detecting and studying TP candidates in more detail. Since the disc formation mechanism in CBe stars (known as the ‘Be phenomenon’) remains poorly understood after more than 150 years of CBe star research, identification and characterization of a larger number of TP candidates may shed new light on the evolutionary phases of various types of emission-line stars. We were unable to conduct a spectroscopic investigation on our samples since spectra are currently unavailable for the majority of TP candidates. As a result, we want to perform such a study for our newly identified sample of TP candidates in the future utilizing high resolution spectra. Spectroscopic investigations of TP candidates, as well as the comparison of their spectral features with that of CBe and HAeBe stars, will assist in the understanding of their disc characteristics.

    "title": "Technical aspects of VELC onboard ADITYA-L1: India’s first solar space mission",
    "body": "2021/11/29 -  This article is the review of a journal paper on the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph, the primary payload onboard India’s first solar space mission, ADITYA-L1. The paper discusses some technical details of VELC and the work done in analyzing them. This article is an attempt to introduce the reader to the instrument, its science and the content of the paper in a simplified manner.  ADITYA-L1 is an Indian satellite with seven payloads, planned to be launched next year. This satellite will not orbit the Earth; rather, it will be at the Lagrangian 1 (L1) point. The L1 point is the location in the Sun – Earth line where their combined gravitational pull equals the centripetal force needed for a small object to move with them. This will be India’s first space mission to study the Sun. The Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) is arguably the primary payload in this mission, and the paper under discussion here deals with characterizing certain technical aspects of VELC.   Figure 1: Illustration of the ADITYA-L1 satellite with its payloads. Credits: ISRO The VELC will observe the solar corona, which is the tenuous, outermost layer of the solar atmosphere. It will analyze the coronal temperature, plasma velocity, density, etc. It will also study Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and the solar wind. CMEs are large clouds of fast-moving plasma, formed by spectacular explosions in the corona, whereas the solar wind is a continuous stream of charged particles the Sun sends out to interplanetary space. The mesmerizing aurora (also called polar lights) are caused by the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth’s magnetic field. The details of VELC: The VELC consists of a coronagraph, spectrograph, polarimetry module and detectors, aside from auxiliary optics. A coronagraph is an instrument used to observe the very dim solar corona, by blocking the bright central disk of the Sun. Coronagraphs usually have a central occulter to block the light from the solar disk; like an artificial solar eclipse. This causes only the surrounding light from the corona to pass through the coronagraph and is available for further analysis or recording. In the case of VELC, instead of a central occulter, a mirror with a circular hole at its center is used to discard the disk light and reflect only the coronal light into the instrument. In general, coronagraphs occult not just the solar disk, but some of the surrounding regions also. This is to reduce the light scattered from the edge of the occulter. Here, the disadvantage is that we won’t be able to observe and study the lower corona, adjacent to the solar disk. For example, we say that the coronagraph field-of-view (FOV) starts from 2 radii of the Sun if it occults everything within a distance of twice the solar radius from the center of the Sun. The VELC will have the smallest occulting radius among coronagraphs, with the FOV starting from 1. 05 radii of the Sun. A spectrograph is an instrument that splits polychromatic light (consisting of multiple wavelengths) into its constituent wavelengths (spectrum). This is similar to a prism splitting white light into VIBGYOR – at different angles from the face of the prism, we get different wavelengths of light. In VELC, a component called grating is used to generate the spectrum. If in a prism, refraction causes white light to split into different wavelengths, in the VELC grating, reflection, diffraction and interference together create the spectra. The presence or absence of certain wavelengths in light and their relative amplitudes can be used to find out details of the source of the light and the medium through which it travelled. Thus, the spectrum gives us details of the solar corona. Next comes the polarimetry module. Polarimetry is the technique of understanding the direction of electric and magnetic fields associated with an electromagnetic (EM) wave. We know that light is an EM wave and that the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other, and they lie in a plane (say, Plane A) perpendicular to the direction of propagation of light. But these EM fields could be oriented in infinitely many perpendicular directions in Plane A. The electric field and magnetic field could be oriented North-South and East-West respectively, or they could be oriented North-East – South-West and North-West – South-East, just to mention two examples. Light is a collection of photons and different photons could have different orientations of EM fields in Plane A as described above. The orientation of the EM fields depends on the process that creates the photon and the environment in which it is created. In general, a source of light will be an equal mix of all these different processes, with the result that the generated light will have EM fields in all directions in Plane A. We say that all directions in Plane A are equally probable for the EM field, and we call the resultant light unpolarised light. Now, if the source of photons has an asymmetry, i. e. if the processes that create a particular orientation of the EM field are in abundance, and/or if the source environment (say ambient EM fields) aides the generation of EM fields in a particular direction, then the light we observe will have an abundance of EM field oriented in that direction; now the light is said to be polarised. The magnetic field in a region affects the polarization of light generated from that region, and thus we can calculate the magnetic field by measuring the polarization. Understanding the distribution of magnetic fields is crucial to our analysis of the solar atmosphere. Thus, this is one of the ways in which measuring the polarisation of light helps us study the solar corona. For measuring polarisation, the polarimetry module contains special optics called the polarisation modulator and analyser. The detectors in VELC are CMOS-based. The detectors in normal DSLR cameras are also CMOS based, with the difference that the VELC detectors have very low noise and are adapted for use in space. When light falls on the pixels of these detectors, electrons are generated by the photoelectric effect. Higher the intensity of light, the higher the number of electrons generated. When the detector is read out, the internal circuitry will convert the electron count in each pixel to a digital count. This is how an image is generated by a CMOS detector. The path of light through VELC: The light entering the instrument from the coronagraph is split into two, based on its wavelength. This is done by a Dichroic Beam Splitter (DBS) which reflects light of a certain wavelength while transmitting other wavelengths. The reflected light (wavelength &lt; 5100 Å) goes to a section called the continuum channel while the transmitted light goes to another section called the spectral channel. In the continuum channel, a filter is used to cut down the wavelength to 5000 Å ± 5 Å (ie. green colour light). This light is then focused on a CMOS camera and the image of the corona is recorded. In the spectral channel, the light transmitted by the DBS is focused on a multi-slit before it goes to the spectrograph. The multi-slit is a unique feature of the VELC. It consists of four slits parallel to and equidistant from each other. A slit is used to restrict not the intensity of light, but the region from which the light is originating. Thus, each slit will observe only a narrow strip of the region in the corona. A multi-slit with four slits will observe four different locations in the corona simultaneously. Now, by moving either the multi-slit or the focused image on the multi-slit, we can observe different parts of the corona; this is called scanning the field-of-view (FOV), and scanning is done perpendicular to the length of the slit. Compared to a single-slit setup, four slits take only one-fourth the time to scan the same (FOV). This means the VELC can do observations four times faster than a single-slit spectrograph. After passing through the multi-slit, the light falls on the spectrograph grating, where it is split into multiple wavelengths as a function of the angle of reflection from the grating. Three wavelength bands (5303 Å: cyan - green colour, 7892 Å: red - near-infrared, 10747 Å: near-infrared) are filtered from this section and each directed to a separate CMOS detector, where the spectra of the corona at that wavelength are recorded. The 10747-channel has a polarimetry module in front of its detector. Thus we can find the polarization of light from the 10747-spectra. Overview of the paper: Ritesh Patel and their team calculated the number of photons (photon count) and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) in all three wavelength bands in the spectral channel, for different exposure times, different widths of the multi-slit, different coronal heights, temperatures, etc. To calculate the photon count, we made use of the atomic database, CHIANTI. CHIANTI inputs environmental parameters like the temperature, electron density, etc. , and instrument parameters like the instrument’s full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) (which depends on the slit-width), spectral dispersion, etc. It then gives a distribution of the photon count as a function of the wavelength. The SNR is a measure of the goodness of a signal. Whenever we make an observation, in addition to our signal, we also get noise from the surroundings. This consists of signals from other sources and the internal noise of the instrument. SNR is the ratio of the strength (power or amplitude) of our signal to the strength of the noise. For example, SNR=1 means that the signal and noise levels are the same. If SNR &lt; 1, we say that our signal is embedded in the noise. In such a condition, it will be difficult to discriminate noise from our signal. Thus, a large value of SNR is always preferred. In the case of VELC, SNR is calculated by comparing the CHIANTI photon count with the photon count from simulated instrument scatter and noise. This is done for all three wavelengths in the spectral channel. A larger slit width means more photons and higher SNR, but a smaller exposure time for our detectors, since they can only observe a certain amount of photons before getting saturated. For the VELC 10747-channel, the exposure time is fixed. So based on this exposure time, the slit-width is optimized to achieve the required photon count and SNR. The CHIANTI spectra is also transformed into a multi-slit spectral image, one for each wavelength (Figure 4 in the paper). These are how the outputs of the VELC spectral channel will look like. In this particular case, the synthetic spectra are created for CME (Coronal Mass Ejection) data from the K-Coronagraph at Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO/KCor). So, in this paper, we calculated the slit-width to optimize the observations of the VELC. We also generated the synthetic spectra for a CME. The data we got here will help in setting up observation procedures of the VELC to perfectly capture CMEs and other dynamical solar events.

    "title": "Polarization of the light reflected from exoplanets: A new window into the study of exoplanets",
    "body": "2021/11/26 -  Polarization is an emerging technique in the field of exoplanets. Understanding the basic physics behind the polarization of the light observed from the planets can help us study them in detail. One such aspect is to study the polarization of the reflection from the exoplanets, which can tell us about their atmospheres, especially the clouds present in them and also, the surface features. Several big-budget missions are being planned for polarimetric observation of the exoplanets. Theoretical simulation and modeling of planetary polarization plays an important role in this regard as they help us decide the targets as well as prepare the roadmaps for those missions.  After the discovery of thousands of exoplanets, the scientists are on a desperate quest to arrive at new direct and indirect techniques to get a complete picture about the formation, dynamics and the atmospheres of the exoplanets. In that regard, polarimetric techniques have opened a new window into the study of the exoplanets by overcoming many of the limitations of the traditional techniques. Light is a wave of electric and magnetic fields. These waves oscillate at random direction perpendicular to the propagation of light. When light gets scattered by atoms, molecules or cloud particulates in the atmosphere or reflected by a surface, the waves oscillate in a particular direction. Then the light is called to be linearly polarized. An instrument called a polarimeter can measure the amount of polarization as it allows light waves oscillating only in a particular direction to pass. For example. if we watch the sky by using polarized sunglasses, we can see a change in the brightness of the sky at different directions. This is because of the fact that sunlight gets polarized due to scattering by the molecules and the dust particles in the atmosphere. Similarly, when planets reflect the light of the parent star, that light gets polarized. As a consequence, the reflected light of all the planets in the Solar system is polarized. So, we can leverage this property of light to study the reflecting exoplanets as well. Detecting light reflected from the exoplanets is difficult as the reflected light is feeble compared to the starlight itself and on top of that, only a small fraction of that reflected light is polarized. Moreover, in the case of planets that cannot be resolved from their host stars, the light from the host star contaminates the planetary light and the observable polarization in such a case can be as low as a few parts per million (10-6 order). As a result, detecting this polarization is extremely challenging. However, there are a few high-end instruments such as HIPPI, PlanetPol, POLISH, among others which are capable of detecting a polarization signal at parts per million (ppm) level. We have worked on a detailed theoretical calculation of the polarization observable from the Jupiter-like exoplanets. This will guide the existing instruments in framing observational strategies and will also help in the design of the future sophisticated instruments for detecting polarization from exoplanets. We published this work in the Astrophysical Journal (link given below). The projection of a 3D planet on sky facing us is a 2D disk (for example, the lunar disk) which is almost circular in shape. We developed a Python-based radiative transfer code (see Ref. 4) for the numerical simulation of the polarized intensity at each point on such a disk of a planet. We, then, calculated the total intensity by averaging this intensity over the disk, since we cannot resolve the planetary disk. The polarization of light from opposite hemispheres tend to be in opposite directions (see Figure 2). As a result, after disk averaging, the opposite polarizations tend to cancel out each other. This is why the disk averaged polarization from a star or a fully illuminated planet is close to zero. However, since the illuminated portion of the planetary disk varies with its phase angle (αorb; like when we see different phases of the Moon), the degree of polarization also changes. Polarization of the light reflected from a planet is maximum at half phases (αorb= 900 or αorb= 2700) and minimum at full phases (αorb= 00 i. e. when fully illuminated or αorb= 900 i. e. when fully dark). Another factor determining the degree of observable polarization is the orbital inclination (i) of the planet (angle at which we view the orbital plane of the planet; see Figure 1) i. e. whether the planetary orbit is at an edge-on view (transiting planets; i=900 ), or at a face-on view (i=00 ) or is at an intermediate angle.   Figure 1: Schematic diagram of a planet at an orbital phase αorb orbiting with an inclination angle i.   Figure 2: Intensity of the total reflected light and the polarized light (Q/I and U/I) in the visible wavelengths at different points of the partly illuminated face (orbital phase being 450) of the Exoplanet orbiting at face-on and edge-on views, two extreme cases of orbital inclination. Positive (greenish) and negative (bluish) polarizations produced at different longitudes tend to cancel out each other. The net non-zero detectable disk-averaged polarization arises because of an incomplete cancellation owing to the geometric asymmetry.   Figure 3: Predicted percentage of detectable disk-averaged polarization in the visible wavelength region and at different orbital phase angles of a cloudy exoplanet orbiting at different inclination angles. The polarization is constant with time if the planet is viewed face-on (i=00). For all other inclination angles, the polarization is maximum during the two half phases of the planet and minimum during the full phases i. e. , when the day (αorb=00) and the night (αorb=1800) sides face the observer. Unlike the traditional and popular methods such as Transit Photometry and Radial Velocity methods which can detect planets only if they are viewed almost edge-on, polarimetric method can detect and probe exoplanets orbiting with a broad range of orbital inclination angles. Hence, we can use this technique to detect exoplanets in future. Moreover, polarimetric studies can complement the other studies providing us with deeper insights into the structure of the atmospheres, especially about the clouds and hazes in the atmospheres as well as the surface features (for rocky planets) of the exoplanets. Using this powerful technique, we will be able to even detect liquid water on the surface of the exo-Earths in the future!

    "title": "The First Theoretical Model of the Near-Surface Shear Layer of the Sun",
    "body": "2021/11/24 -  It is well known that the Sun rotates differentially, i. e. its equator rotates faster than the pole. Not only at the surface, but the solar rotation profile also varies with the radius, which was discovered in helioseismic observation. This observation reveals an exciting feature close to the visible solar surface that the rotation profile of the Sun changes very sharply, which is named as Near-Surface Shear Layer (NSSL). In this work astronomers from ARIES and IISc have given the theoretical explanation for the existence of NSSL very the first time. They have used the thermal wind balance equation to explain the existence of NSSL.  The Sun, our life-giving star, has always been a star of many interests. Its importance for the living beings made many astronomers turn their telescope towards the Sun just after the advent of the telescope by Galileo Galilei. The early and regular observations of the Sun revealed the presence of dark spots, now known as sunspots, and 11 years of periodic variation in their number of appearances, popularly known as the solar cycle. The systematic observations of sunspots also show that the solar surface rotates differentially, which means the equator of the Sun spins faster than its pole. However, the internal rotation of the Sun has only been revealed after the helioseismology (technique of using sound waves to peek inside the Sun) era. Helioseismology has answered the many puzzling questions about the Sun while raising many questions about our nearest star at the same time. One of the crucial observations that helioseismology has made was the existence of the near-surface shear layer (NSSL).  The NSSL is the region very close to the visible solar surface, where there is a sharp change in the rotation profile of the Sun. The understanding of NSSL is crucial for the Sun, but it will also help us understand the other stars. Many researchers had indicated the presence of such a layer in the past based on solar surface observations but the real inference has been provided only after helioseismic measurements. Here in this work, researchers from ARIES, Nainital and IISc Bangalore have given the theoretical explanation for the existence of NSSL, for the very first time. Their study used the thermal wind balance equation, which tells about how the slight difference in temperature between solar poles and equator, which is called thermal wind term, is balanced by the centrifugal force appearing due to solar differential rotation. Now, the question is, why are they expecting the solar pole to have a slightly higher temperature? To understand this, we have to think about the motion of plasma blobs or convective blobs in the solar convection zone in which heat is transported by convection in the same way as it is transported in boiling water. Unlike boiling water, the Sun is rotating, and hence the upward moving blobs will experience Coriolis force. The effect of Coriolis force is zero on blobs moving along the axis of rotation (as in the case of a pole) and will be maximum when they are moving perpendicular to it (as in the case of the equator). Therefore, the heat transfer will be more efficient along the axis of rotation, leading to a higher temperature near the pole which drives the plasma from pole to equator. Another term is called centrifugal, which arises due to solar differential rotation driving the plasma in the opposite direction that is equator to pole. The temperature profile of the Sun shows a sharp decrease near the visible surface and authors have shown that the pole-equator temperature difference also decreases as we approach the surface. To balance these effects Solar rotation profile (centrifugal term) has to change sharply, giving rise to NSSL. Most scientists believe that this condition is valid only in the interior of the Sun, and it does not hold near the solar surface. In their work, the authors have shown that this belief actually holds near the surface as well. They have noted that if this condition is true near the solar surface it can explain the existence of NSSL which is inferred in helioseismology based observation.

    "body": "2021/11/21 -  Curiosity is what has driven mankind to observations of new phenomena. Every twinkling star in the night sky is definitely not due to the atmospheric refraction of earth. Rather, one might be looking at a variable star, each with a different origin story to tell. A study of variable stars enhances our understanding of the universe.  1. 	Introduction: One of the first nursery rhymes I might have been introduced to was the popular rhyme, “Twinkle twinkle little star”. Over the years, the verse took a different form once we were introduced to the astronomically correct idea of a star. Now the rhyme reads somewhat like below. Twinkle twinkle little starYou look small cause you are farLightyears out from here to thereYour light is distorted by the airSo you twinkle twinkle little star Elementary physics lectures have introduced us to the idea of atmospheric refraction, due to which observed starlight seems to vary in intensity. This phenomenon of twinkling is attributed to the varying densities of the atmosphere. However, not all twinkling stars attribute their twinkle to atmospheric refraction. Some twinkle due to their inherent properties. Such stars are called variable stars. The time scales associated with stellar evolution are generally so large that the Universe has been traditionally viewed as a static phenomenon. However, we have long known short human time scale events, such as Solar System events and stellar explosions. With the advent of robotically controlled telescopes and high cadence near all-sky monitoring in the last decade of the 1990s, the study of astronomical events on ever shorter time scales has exploded. With access to this new stream of data, our understanding of many phenomena has increased significantly. However, the number of unanswered questions have increased multiple times. One such question addressed the dilemma of why many celestial bodies varied in their brightness. This led to the study in the field of Time-Domain Astronomy and variable stars. 2. 	Time Domain Astronomy: Time domain astrophysics is a field of observational astronomy that studies the universe on all timescales from less than milliseconds to more than decades and at all wavelengths. This became possible due to the availability of great detectors and computing advances over the past decades. The idea of observations and analysis have now moved beyond the one-off photographic surveys in the past. Beginning from the 1990s, the MACHO(massive astrophysical compact halo object), OGLE(Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment), and SuperWASP projects used large field of view, highly sensitive cameras on manual or robotic optical or near-infrared telescopes and obtained deep digital images of large swathes of the sky. These scans were repeated to build up vast databases of time-resolved images. If we were to describe the elementary ideas of time-domain astronomy, we could explain it in the following manner. Observe a particular section of the sky. Note the physical limits visible in that section. After some time t, observe the area under consideration. If any of the physical quantities have changed from earlier, we tag the particular body in the database for future study. The time it takes for the instrument to re-observe the same patch of sky is referred to as the “cadence. ” The old strategy of looking deep and far into the Universe is used, and sources of a given brightness methodically mapped out in a three dimensional volume. In time-domain astronomy, sources that vary by some brightness with a rate equal to the inverse of the instrument cadence can be steadily mapped out. In a way, the time-domain adds another dimension, given by the frequency equal to the inverse cadence, to the properties of observed phenomena. The study of variable stars is an essential section of time-domain astronomy. 3. 	Variable Stars: Omicron Ceti was the first variable star to be identified in 1596 by David Fabricius. Johannes Holwards observed Omicron Ceti pulsating in a regular 11-month cycle in 1638. This discovery debunked the theory that the stars were eternal and invariable as ancient philosophers such as Aristotle had believed. Variable stars change in brightness over time. These changes can vary from as small as a few parts in a million or by a considerable factor. The changes observed can also range from a few milliseconds to a few years or decades, for that matter. Since many astronomical bodies can qualify as a “variable star”, an array of techniques are devised to discover and analyse the possibility of a variable star. The next obvious question is on the importance of studying variable stars. The study is of importance as the variations provide unique insights about nature, the origins, evolution and often the future trajectory of the star under observance. This information helps us deduce more fundamental knowledge about our universe. The variations may be due to the rotational motion executed by a spotted star, or due to a star being eclipsed by its companion star, or even by an unseen planet. The variations may also be due to the vibrations of a star. If these vibrations are complex, we might be able to get a rough picture of the internal structure and composition of this star. The variations may be due to eruptions on a star (flares), or an accretion disc (dwarf novae) or major explosions on a star (novae), or to the total disruption of a star in a supernova. Supernovae are one of the most violent incidents in the known universe. However, the existence of life is an indirect result of supernovae. They help to recycle the atoms created in stars into space. Some of these atoms became part of the Sun, others into planets, and for that matter, even the biosphere. It is deduced that the elements heavier than iron were mostly created in the supernova explosion. Supernovae may be dramatic and extreme, but they represent only one of the many roles that variable stars play in modern astrophysics and in our understanding of the universe and the processes which govern it. The organised study and recording of observations led to the establishment of the Variable Star Section of the British Astronomical Association (BAAVSS) in 1890, followed soon after by the establishment of variable star studies at Harvard College Observatory, which eventually led to the founding of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) in 1911. 4. 	Classification of Variable Stars: The General Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS) recommends an official classification system of variable stars based on:  Light Curve Temperature Luminosity Population typeBased on this system, a family tree of variable stars can be constructed. Such a tree is called a Variability Tree. A simplified version of the variability tree is given below.  Figure 1: Variability tree, denoting the various classes of variable stars. The image can be found here. The variable stars are classified into two groups based on the reason of variability in the observed intensities, Intrinsic and Extrinsic variable stars. They are further categorised into sub-classes, which are discussed below. 5. 	Intrinsic Variable Stars: Intrinsic variable stars vary their light output, hence their brightness, due to the physical variation in the star or stellar system. This type of star provides a large amount of information about the internal structure of the star that helps astronomers to model the stellar evolution. Pulsating stars and eruptive or cataclysmic variable stars belong to this category. 5. 1. 	Pulsating Variable StarsPulsating variables are the stars that show periodic expansion and contraction of their surface layers. The change in brightness occurs due to the change in size or shape. Most of the pulsating stars simply expand and contract repeatedly in a continuing cycle of size changes and this is known as the fundamental mode of pulsation. Some of the changes not only in their size but also in their internal arrangement of material. Some others vibrate in more than one way at the same time and this makes the system complex. Like most vibrating systems, pulsating variables repeat their changes and they tend to be periodic. Depending on the period, on the mass and evolutionary status of the star, pulsating variables are classified into many categories. We shall discuss each sub-category briefly. Cepheid variable starsCepheid variables form an important class of pulsating variables. These are large yellow stars pulsating with periods from 1 to 70 days, with an amplitude of light variation from 0. 1 to 2 magnitudes. They are very bright objects and have periodic oscillations. Cepheid light curves are distinctive and show a rapid rise in brightness followed by a more gradual decline that is shaped like a shark fin. The spectral class of Cepheid actually changes as it pulsates, being about an F type at maximum luminosity and down to G or K at minimum. Cepheids follow a period-luminosity relation. Period luminosity relationship states that ‘more luminous cepheids pulsated more slowly’. This concept was put forward by Henrietta Leavitt in 1912. The period of cepheid can be calculated from its light curve which can be used to estimate the Cepheid’s luminosity. Knowing its magnitude and luminosity we can calculate the distance using the relation m - M = 5 log(d/10) where m is the apparent magnitude, M the absolute magnitude and d the distance to the star in parsecs.   Figure 2: Light curve of cepheid Delta Cephei. The image can be found here. Long-period variables: One of the largest population of pulsating variables are the long-period variables (LPVS). They are pulsating red giants or supergiants with periods ranging from 30 to 1000 days. Long-period variables are further subdivided into two major subclasses, the Mira type and the semiregular variables. a. 	Mira variableThese are periodic red giant variables that vary with periods of 80 to 1000 days in magnitudes as high as 2. 5 in the visible bands. Mira type variables are red giant stars, often of enormous size. Their high luminosity means that they can be detected at large distances. Many of them are slowly ejecting a steady stream of matter into the surrounding space and this mass loss has dramatic consequences on their future evolution. They have weak outer layers in their atmosphere which gets heated from regular pulsations. These are interesting due to their similar size as the Sun and that they are undergoing a late stage of the same evolutionary path that all one-solar mass stars, including the Sun, will experience. b. 	Semi-regular variableSemiregular variables are giants or supergiants which show appreciable periodicity accompanied by semiregular or irregular light variation. Their periods range from 30 to 1000 days, generally with amplitude variations of fewer than 2. 5 magnitudes. RR LyraeRR Lyrae stars are of short period (. 05 to 1. 2 days), pulsating white giant stars, usually of spectral class A. They are older and less massive than Cepheids. The amplitude of variation of RR Lyrae is generally from . 3 to 2 magnitudes. RV Tauri StarRV Tauri stars are yellow supergiants having a characteristic light variation with deep and shallow minima. Their periods, defined as the interval between two deep minima range from 30 to 150 days. They show brightness variations of up to 3 magnitudes. Some of these stars show long term cyclic variations from hundreds of thousands of days. Generally, their spectral class ranges from G to K.   Figure 3: Light curve of RV Tauri star R Scuti. Image courtesy: Wikimedia commons 5. 2. 	Cataclysmic variable stars: Eruptive variables are stars varying in brightness because of violent outbursts caused by thermonuclear processes in their surface layers. They exhibit significant and rapid changes in their luminosity which is usually accompanied by mass outflow in the form of stellar winds of variable intensity. These are a system of two stars (binary system) orbiting very close to each other. One of them is a normal sunlike or giant star, while the other is a white dwarf. Some of the outermost material from the larger star is pulled away by the white dwarf’s gravity, but this material does not fall directly onto the white dwarf. Instead, it builds up in a disk called an accretion disk, which orbits the white dwarf. Thus, the eruptive variable star is a combination of normal or giant stars, white dwarf and accretion disk as shown in the following figure.   Figure 4: A cataclysmic variable star. The image can be found here. The combination of main-sequence or giant stars, white dwarf and accretion disk lead to celestial fireworks. So, instead of varying like pulsating variables, eruptive variables exhibit outbursts of activity. Some events may result in the destruction of the star while others can reoccur one or more times. These are called recurrent novae. The changes in their light curves are usually very unpredictable and tend to be sudden and dramatic. 5. 3. 	Supernovae: Supernovae are examples of such cataclysmic variable stars. These occur either during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion. The original object(progenitor) either collapses to a neutron star or black hole or gets destroyed. We will now look briefly into the types of supernovae. Type I supernovaeThese do not exhibit any hydrogen lines in spectra. Type Ia supernovae are understood to arise from white dwarf stars in a close binary system. As gas from the companion star accumulates on the white dwarf, the white dwarf is continuously undergoing compression. At the Chandrasekhar Limit, the white dwarf has accumulated too much mass to resist the force of gravity, thus setting off a runaway nuclear reaction inside. This leads to a cataclysmic supernova outburst. Type Ia supernovas are employed as “standard candles” to measure cosmic distances because they are believed to blaze with equal brightness at their peaks. Hence, they can be used as standard candles to determine the distance to a galaxy once the stretch factor is accounted for. Type II supernovaeA pre-requisite for a star to explode as a Type II supernova is that the star must be several times more massive than the sun (around 8 to 10 Msolar). Once the core of this star runs out of hydrogen and then helium at its core, it moves ahead with the nucleosynthesis process to create heavier metals. As a result, heavier elements accumulate at the centre, similar to a layered onion. Lighter elements are found in the outer regions of the star. Once the star’s core becomes heavier than the Chandrasekhar limit, the star begins to implode. This is why these supernovae are called core-collapse supernovae. Eventually, the core starts to heat up and becomes denser. The implosion bounces back off the core and expels the stellar material into space, forming the supernova. Type II supernovae show hydrogen lines in their early spectra. 6. 	Extrinsic Variable Stars: Extrinsic variable stars are those in which the light output changes due to some process external to the star itself. The two main classes of extrinsic stars are the eclipsing binaries and rotating variables. 6. 1. 	Eclipsing binariesEclipsing binaries are binary star systems whose members eclipse each other, blocking one another’s light. As a result, the system looks occasionally fainter to observers on earth. The light curve of an eclipsing binary depends on the sizes and brightness of the stars, their separation from each other and the geometry of view from the earth. The process of eclipsing and the corresponding light curve of an eclipsing system is shown in the figure below.   Figure 5: Eclipsing binary star. The image can be found here. 6. 2. 	Rotating starRotating variables are rapidly rotating stars, often in binary systems, that undergo small amplitude changes in light due to dark or bright spots on the star’s surface which is much similar to sunspots on the sun. Stars with sizeable sunspots show significant variations in brightness as they rotate. Stars that have ellipsoidal shapes also exhibit variation in brightness when they present varying areas of the surface to the observer. 7. 	Conclusion: Curiosity is what has driven mankind to observations of new phenomena. Every twinkling star in the night sky is definitely not due to the atmospheric refraction of earth. Rather, one might be looking at a variable star, each with a different origin story to tell. A study of variable stars enhances our understanding of the universe. Cepheid variables help in determining distances to galaxies and determining the age of the Universe. Mira variables help us in making an understanding of the future evolution of the Sun. Accretion disks in cataclysmic variables help us to understand the activity inside active galaxies with supermassive black holes. Type Ia supernovae have helped us conclude on the accelerated expansion of the Universe by acting as a standardisable candle. Transiting extrasolar planets provide clues into the processes of planetary formation.

    "body": "2021/11/18 -  The focus of this article is solar wind. I first take the reader through the theory &amp; observations, and various properties of solar wind. Then, I take a detour through machine and deep learning which form the basis of our work. Finally, I take the reader through our work on predicting, and investiagting sources of solar wind using deep learning.  Note: This article was originally given as a talk to the students of the Astro club of Fergusson college, Pune on 24 August 2021 . The night sky is one of the most primal sources of curiosities for many living creatures - more so for humanity. If you live in a village/town without the glaring lights and pollution, you can see the beautiful night sky dotted with stars, and possibly also the majestic Ganga of the heavens1. In the backdrop of these stars which follow regular paths in the sky lie the wanderers, who seem to move like kids in a park. Though these wanderers (or Planets, as we know them now) seem to move here and there, they also move in periodic paths that can very nearly be predicted. However, humans would see very different objects once in a while- sometimes with a tail of smoke, sometimes falling to the Earth, and sometimes as a guest star. These apparently unpredictable events would cause panic in people, and lead to associating such events with ‘good’ or ‘bad’ omens. One such class of objects which have long been observed, and feared by humans is the comets. Many thousand years have passed since, and now we know what these comets are (and hopefully given up on the superstition!). These are rocky balls covered with dust and ice which orbit the Sun in highly eccentric orbits. This means we see many of these comets extremely rarely – for instance, we can see Halley’s comet only once in 76 years2! In Fig. 1, an image of the comet Hale-Boop is shown. This image came in as an Astronomy Picture Of the Day. You will notice that by and large the comet has two general parts – a “nucleus” and a “tail”. The nucleus is the core, rocky body of the comet, while the tail is the fuzzy smoke-like stream coming out from the nucleus. As you will further notice, there are two tails for this comet. These tails are the white “dust” tail and the blue “ion” tail. If you draw a line connecting the Sun and the comet’s nucleus, the ion tail points directly away from the Sun, while the dust tail lags a bit. This observation was not missed by astronomers in the 1940s and 50s, and many sought to explain why this was the case. Then, in 1951, Ludwig Biermann proposed that while the dust tail comes due to the nucleus getting hot (so ice simply evaporates), the ion tail comes due to charged particles hitting the comet (Biermann L. , 1951).   Fig. 1: Dust and Ion Tales of Comet Hale-Bopp. Credit &amp; Copyright: John Gleason APOD 27/12/2000. This was a rather startling proposition. Remember, just a little over 50 years prior to this paper, Michelson and Morley had shown that interplanetary space is empty, with no matter. Then where would these charged particles come from? In 1958, Eugene Parker at the University of Chicago submitted a paper to The Astrophysical Journal on “Interplanetary gas and magnetic field”. He had asked the question: what happens to a star like the Sun, with a hot atmosphere3, as we move away from it? Parker had found that the atmospheric pressure pushes the atmosphere into a wind of particles, streaming across the solar system, and into the interplanetary medium. He called this the solar wind. Now, there was no shred of evidence yet for such a large scale wind (remember, Biermann had only hypothesized - science needs evidence4), and the referees5 rejected the paper while not finding any particular fault with it! But the journal’s editor was Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar - the man who had theoretically, among other things, predicted that a white dwarf can be stable only within a certain mass limit now called the Chandrasekhar limit (Venkataraman G. , 1992). Chandrasekhar found Parker’s paper to be well done mathematically, and hence overrode the referees to publish it (Arnab Rai Choudhuri, 2014; Parker, E. N. , 1958). Parker predicted quantities like velocity and pressure of the solar wind. He also performed a calculation of how the magnetic field of the Sun would look like in the solar wind. He found that the field lines would be buffeted in an Archimedian spiral, shown in Fig. 2. In 1959, the Soviet probe Luna 1 was launched with experiments to the moon. However, it performed measurements across the interplanetary space and found signatures of these high speed particles coming from the Sun. Thus, observationally, the hypothesis of the solar wind was validated! Fig 2: The “Parker Spiral”, taken from Eugene Parker’s original paper. Image source: Parker, E. N. , 1958 This caused an explosion of science on the solar wind. Then, sometime in the 1990s, the spacecraft Ulysses was launched to study the Sun from its equator to its poles. It tried to associate, on average, the source of the solar wind on the Sun. This observation is shown as the complicated Fig. 3, with an image of the Sun in the background, and the solar wind speed measurements as the lines. To read this plot, imagine that you are moving on a circle around the Sun’s image. The smaller your circle (closer to the Sun), slower is the wind – larger your circle, the faster the wind is. Ulysses found that the solar wind that comes approximately from the equator is slow - less than 500 km/s - and highly variable. The solar wind coming from the poles is much faster, peaks at around 700 km/s, and is quite steady. This observation suggested that the solar wind comes in two modalities - slow and fast.  Fig. 3: Overlay of SWOOPS solar wind speed and EIT/LASCO/Mauna Loa images of the solar corona. Image credit: ESA This opened Pandora’s box. Scientists started tackling these observations with two questions:  What are all the differences between the fast and the slow wind? Which regions in the Sun give rise to the two wind modalities? What physical processes give rise to the two wind modalities?Meanwhile, scientists found some clues on all the differences and which regions in the Sun give rise to the two modalities. First, both the winds have quite different compositions. This is an extremely technical topic for a later day, but it is enough to know that different ions are present in different proportions in the slow wind. But what about the “source regions” of the solar wind? In Fig. 4, I show the results obtained by Wang and Sheeley in 1990. They studied areas on the Sun called Coronal Holes (Wang and Sheeley, 1990) (henceforth, I call them CHs), which are seen as dark structures in the solar corona, and represent regions where magnetic field lines are open. Wang and Sheeley found that the fast wind speed showed variations similar to the CH area. So they hypothesized that the fast wind comes, at least in some measure, from CHs.    Fig 4: Solar wind speed and Coronal hole area comparison across the solar cycle. Notice that as CH area increases, the wind speed increases, and so on. Image courtesy: Wang and Sheeley, 1990.  The slow wind, on the other hand, is very tenuous. David Brooks and collaborators measured the composition of the solar corona, and attempted to narrow down on the origin of the solar wind (Brooks D. et al. , 2015). Brooks and others found that the Active Regions (ARs) boundaries show composition similar to the slow wind, and conjectured that the slow wind comes from these regions. The ARs are bright, complex structures that consist of numerous closed loops of magnetic field, holding hot plasma. However, in 2019, the Parker Solar Probe observations showed that the slow wind seems to come from CHs near the equator (Bale S. et al. , 2019). These are shown in Fig. 5. In summation, these observations showed how we could find potential sources of the solar wind by mapping the “wind properties” to “solar coronal properties”.    Fig. 5: Left: Slow wind from Active region boundaries by Brooks et al 2014. The blue image is an example of the solar corona, with the bright areas depicting the ARs. The red and green patches show the slow wind sources. Right: Equatorial Coronal hole . The region marked “Perihelion” is the location of the Parker Solar Probe, and the corresponding dark patch below is the potential source region. Image courtesy: Bale S. et al. , 2019 . Meanwhile, I and collaborators (or rather, my mentors!) were studying a slightly different problem. We were trying to develop a model that can predict what the solar wind measured near Earth, given coronal data. Since we don’t know the exact locations of the sources of different solar wind modalities, we were trying to understand how best we can circumvent this problem and automatically figure out the solar wind given an approximate source region. What inspired us? Artificial Intelligence (AI). When we started our work, we were at the cusp of rapid development and revival of machine &amp; deep learning algorithms. AI is a cool word that generally makes us think of Ultron, Jarvis, Transformers, or even the robot TARS from Interstellar. But in reality, it is a broad term for a set of algorithms that can ‘tune’ and ‘learn’ from the data. A simple example is shown in Fig. 6. What you see here is a game, like Need for Speed. Generally, a player controls the steering and throttle of the car, ensuring it stays in lane (or at least follows a trajectory). Fig. 6 is similar, except that the throttle and steering angle are adaptively ‘learned’ by an AI as we keep feeding in the car images at each instant. The core idea is similar to what is employed by self-driving cars. How cool is that? Fig. 6: A game showing the motion of a car along a road. No human is playing this game -- rather, a machine learning algorithm is predicting what the steering angle and throttle are, given each frame. Image Credits: Sergios Karagiannakos We interpreted from such development that the core idea behind such self driving car setups is to consider a time series of images, and generate a set of real values. The AI automatically figures out what the car is, where the car is, how fast it is moving, and so on. The AI does this by “predicting” the throttle and steering angle, matching the actual needed throttle and steering values, and iteratively reducing the error. Think of it as studying for an exam - you attempt to practise tests, and sure you will not get all the questions correct. But as you keep studying, you will keep learning more and more, and keep getting better and better. But what has this got to do with the Sun? We figured out that we study the Sun simply through a bunch of “images” of the Sun, while the solar wind speed is just a bunch of real values. And so, the solar wind speed prediction is pretty much complimentary to getting self-driving cars moving correctly! We then went ahead, and developed a complex AI called “WindNet”, which takes in images from the Sun and puts out the solar wind speed as a prediction. The WindNet showed pretty good performance – in fact, it was much better than the heuristically used models, and could predict 5-7 days in advance! This was a pretty cool result for a model which has no physics as input – we did not quite tell the model where the solar wind comes from! Till now people have asked what the solar wind is like, if you give an intelligently guessed region on the Sun. But our work has shown that we can ask the reverse question: with an AI which can predict the wind speed, can we ask which regions on the Sun it thinks are important for wind speed prediction? We asked an AI, trained purely on data, and not fed in with any physics, to answer a physics problem. Will it replicate known physics, or will it answer garbage? The first question we asked our model was: Where does the fast wind come from? The answer is shown in Fig. 7. The AI thinks that CHs are important for a fast wind prediction, and that too four days before prediction. This was pretty cool – we have seen that the CHs can give rise to fast wind, and the time taken to reach Earth is within the time frame of fast wind travel time! Fig. 7: The fast wind prediction, with the solar image on top, and importance map in the bottom. Blue corresponds to less important regions, while red corresponds to more important regions. Image courtesy: Author. Next, we asked our model: where does the slow wind come from? The response is shown in Fig. 8. The AI thinks that the ARs are important slow wind sources 5-7 days prior to prediction. This is in line with the observation of Brooks and collaborators. However, our AI also thinks the CHs are just a teensy bit important for the slow wind prediction. This is in line with the observation of Bale and collaborators. This was very interesting to us - AI systems have the potential to figure out the sources of the solar wind, without explicitly feeding in any physics mapping! How cool is that! Fig. 8: The slow wind prediction, with the solar image on top, and importance map in the bottom. Blue corresponds to less important regions, while red corresponds to more important regions. Image courtesy: Author. Finally, we evaluated this result statistically. That is, for all CHs, and all ARs, if one looks at this average importance, does it quite conform to known physics? Technical details apart, we found that the fast wind association to CHs was seen clearly by AI, with even the timing coming correct. However, while the slow wind showed strong relation to the ARs, the timing was quite wrong. This tells us that AI presents a potential way of studying the Sun, and the connection between Sun and Earth. However, it also needs to be perfectly trained to generate the mapping, and needs as much data as possible. This is a new era we enter, with the assimilation of AI with physics to generate models, target specific tasks, and even do good science. Let us take a giant leap forward in a quest to figure out the secrets of the Universe, aided by AI!

    "body": "2021/11/16 -  Prof. Thanu Padmanabhan, one of the stalwarts of theoretical physics, and a shining star of the Indian scientific community, left his mortal abode on the 17th of September this year. With a stellar career spanning over four decades, he has been immortalized through his contributions to advancement of theoretical physics and cosmology. In this article, Dr. Karthik Rajeev brings out the essence of some of Prof. Padmanabhan’s seminal works - ranging from the formation of cosmological large scale structure to the interface of quantum mechanics and gravity.    Thanu Padmanabhan (10 March 1957- 17 September 2021) Thanu Padmanabhan, fondly known as Paddy, was an internationally acclaimed Indian theoretical physicist, whose research works are spread across a variety of topics in gravitation, quantum theory and the study of our universe. Progress in theoretical physics happens in two different, but equally important, ways. The first corresponds to significant advances achieved using existing theoretical frameworks, while the second corresponds to, what may be called `paradigm shifts’. Padmanabhan’s immense contributions to physics have been on both of these fronts. About 300 papers in refereed international journals, about 10 books and numerous other articles that he has authored, spread over about four decades of his monumental career, is a testimonial to the impact he made in the field. In 1977, a 20-year-old Padmanabhan started his research journey by investigating the interaction between gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves. The results of his mathematical study were published in the reputed journal Pramana, while he was still an undergraduate student at University College, Trivandrum. Little did his friends and colleagues know that this was only the start of a stellar career of one of the brightest and fastest thinkers of our time. We shall now briefly glance through some of his contributions in the decades that followed.  It should be mentioned that the following `summary’ does not faithfully cover all of Padmanabhan’s contributions. This article is only an attempt to explain, in simpler terms, a few of his works that have influenced the author the most. When the Quantum meets Gravity: Quantum mechanics and the general theory of relativity are two of the foundational pillars on which theoretical physics, as we understand it today, is built. While quantum mechanics offers an efficient approach to understand physics at the smallest scales, general relativity furnishes the most satisfactory theory of gravitational interaction at our disposal today. Recall that according to our current understanding, there are four fundamental interactions in nature: the strong nuclear, the weak nuclear, the electromagnetic and the gravitational interactions (see: Fundamental interaction). A thorough understanding of the first three forces is essential to describe physics at the subatomic to the molecular level. On the other hand, while studying physics at these scales, theoretical physicists often ignore even the existence of gravity and get away with it quite safely! However, the effects of quantum mechanics are quite significant at these smallest scales. Hence, any sensible theory that attempts to describe phenomena at these levels must respect the principles of quantum mechanics. Fortunately, we have a remarkable model to describe the strong nuclear, weak nuclear and electromagnetic forces that incorporate quantum theory, namely, the Standard Model of particle physics (for a recent visual description of the Standard Model, see this link). Then the question arises: What about gravity?. It turns out that quantum mechanics does not play any significant role in the gravitational interactions that, say, govern the dynamics of our Solar system. This is true even for gravitational interactions at much larger scales, say galaxies, galaxy clusters and so on. Does that mean that we should not bother incorporating quantum theory into our models of gravity? The answer is NO! The reason is that there are scenarios in nature where both the effects of quantum mechanics as well as gravitational interactions are believed to be equally significant. One such scenario occurs, for instance, when we consider physics at the very early stages of our Universe. There is a simple trick that physicists use to decide whether a physical scenario demands a quantum theory of gravity. The idea is to check whether the typical length, time and energy scales of a given physical situation is comparable to a set of constants called the Planck length, Planck time and Plack energy, respectively. The reason this works is because the aforementioned Planck quantities are defined solely in terms of the fundamental constants c (the speed of light), h (the Planck’s constant) and G (gravitational constant) (see this link for further information). Recall that Planck’s constant (h) corresponds to quantum mechanics, the speed of light ( c ) to relativity and the gravitational constant (G), of course, to gravity. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the Planck quantities (constructed with h,c and G) correspond to quantum theories with general relativistic gravity! Now, imagine the very early stages of the universe, say, just after or during the Big-Bang, when our universe was extremely `tiny’. During that era, the typical length, time and energy scales are believed to become comparable to the corresponding Planck quantities, hence signaling the need for a quantum theory of gravity to explain the physics at that time. A similar argument can also be made for the extremely dense interior of a black-hole, indicating that quantum gravity effects might be relevant there as well! Therefore, a quantum theory of gravity (translates to “a consistent model of gravitational interaction that incorporates principles of quantum mechanics”) is crucial to understand nature deeply. Unfortunately, however, one of the major challenges in theoretical physics today is to combine the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, into a coherent quantum theory for gravity. The reason gravity has not been tamed this way is primarily because it is not simply a `force’ in the conventional sense. To better understand what makes gravity different, let us briefly review how gravity is described in Einstein’s general theory of relativity (GTR). Einstein taught us that spacetime– the union of space (the ‘where’) and time (the ‘when’)– is the most natural construct to base our understanding of gravity. When there is no matter, spacetime is quite uninteresting and ‘flat’, say, like a flat rubber sheet. The presence of matter introduces non-trivial geometric features on the spacetime, somewhat analogous to how placing a heavy ball on the rubber sheet stretches it.  Gravity, it turns out, is just a manifestation of such geometric features of spacetime. The geometry, in turn, can be mathematically described by a quantity called metric tensor. Imagine the metric tensor as an object that tells us two basic pieces of information about the spacetime: ‘distances’ between two nearby points and ‘angles’ between intersecting lines in the spacetime. Einstein’s famous field equations determine the precise manner in which metric tensor behaves in the presence of matter. On the other hand, in the absence of gravity, physicists usually consider the other interactions to play out in a flat background spacetime, much like how dancers (forces and particles) perform in an inert stage (spacetime). However, the presence of gravity has the consequence that the spacetime itself is dynamic! (Imagine the stage itself performing with the dancers!) To combine quantum mechanics with a realistic theory in which the spacetime itself is dynamic is a major challenge that theoretical physicists are facing even now. In the 1980’s Padmanabhan, along with his supervisor Prof. Jayant V Narlikar, made significant progress in tackling this challenge. An ingenious idea that was the key to some of their works was to consider a simpler scenario in which the dynamic content of gravity is captured by only a ‘piece’ of the metric-tensor, called the conformal factor. Roughly speaking, what this simple scenario meant was that they considered only the distance-providing piece of the metric tensor to be dynamic while restricting the angles to be ‘fixed’ (Recall that metric-tensor gives us ‘distances’ and ‘angles’ in spacetime. ). It turns out that this piece of gravity can be combined with quantum theory in a relatively straightforward way. Therefore, they could perform several calculations that would have been difficult or even impossible in attempts towards a ‘full’ quantum theory of gravity.  Although their model might sound simple, it leads to important insights about the structure of the universe and spacetime in general, of which here we shall briefly look at only two. Before going into the insights that emerged from Padmanabhan’s and his collaborators’ studies, we have to understand certain basics of our universe’s past. There is irrefutable evidence now that our universe is expanding at an accelerated pace. What this implies is that if we imagine the evolution of our universe as a movie and play it in reverse, we would expect that the universe is contracting. Now, using the principles of general relativity and the assumption that our universe is made of reasonably realistic matter content , this thought experiment leads to the fact that the universe must have emerged from a single point in the past! Such a point is technically called a singularity and, in physics, the presence of such singularities signifies potential deficiencies of a theoretical framework. It is generally believed that a quantum theory of gravity would cure this problem. One of the important insights that emerged out of the works of Padmanabhan and Narlikar was that this belief is in fact well-founded.  For instance, one of the outcomes of their simple model was that the singularity at the beginning of our universe may be absent when quantum theory is considered! This might be viewed as a strong indication that a more complete quantum theory of gravity may also have the cure for singularity. Another result that came out of their studies was that the distance between two points in spacetime cannot be made arbitrarily small, instead, there could be a lower limit called ‘zero-point length’. This is quite counter-intuitive because our intuition is that as we bring two points closer and closer, the distance between them eventually becomes zero! The reason for the breaking of our intuition is that quantum effects potentially modify the structure of spacetime at the smallest length scales. In fact, it is found that the presence of `zero-point length’, or something resembling that concept, is a universal feature in several approaches to a quantum theory of gravity. This later motivated Padmanabhan and his collaborators to also investigate the implications of the ‘zero-point length’ in several other important contexts in theoretical physics, which eventually led to many useful physical insights. The grand design of the cosmos:  The formation of large scale structures in the universe is probably the problem requiring a solution in cosmology. — Thanu Padmanabhan At sufficiently large scales, our universe is quite homogeneous and isotropic. It is important to understand what one means by sufficiently large scale. To understand this better, let us consider a very large white sheet of paper. When looked at with naked eyes, the paper looks the same no matter at what point on the paper we are looking and which direction we are looking. But, if we zoom in using a powerful microscope, we will see that the paper is made of a network of microscopic plant fibres, which are arranged to form a uniform flat sheet at scales visible to our naked eyes. Of course, if we zoom in further, we will also find that the fibres themselves are made of cells, which in turn is made of molecules and so on. Similarly, in our universe, the stars are organized into galaxies, which in turn form galaxy groups that form galaxy clusters. These clusters are then arranged into filament-like structures, sheet-like structures and so on. Such large structures are separated by immense voids, hence creating a somewhat foamy texture to our universe, at a very large scale. Just as a paper looks homogeneous to us at scales greater than, say, a few millimetres (although it consists of intricate microscopic plant fibres), our universe is homogeneous at scales much greater than a few hundred million light-years (although, at smaller scales, it consists of several structures like galaxies, galaxy clusters, filaments etc. , at various levels). The fact that the universe is quite homogeneous at sufficiently large scales and at the same time has elaborate structures at smaller scales provides us an important clue about the state of our universe when it was much younger. Scientists believe that in the very early stages of our universe, the density of matter must have been remarkably uniform (hence, the large-scale smoothness we observe today!). However, there must also have been very small variations in this density, as we move from one place to another in the universe. The large scale structures in our universe, that we described earlier, are believed to have formed due to the gravitational field of such density fluctuations. However, the precise manner in which these `primordial’ density fluctuations led to the formation of large scale structures is still not completely understood analytically. Efficient computer simulations have been developed by several scientists and collaborations to make progress in understanding this problem. Although such simulations are helpful in making concrete predictions, they often do not provide us with clear physical insight. To gain more insight one needs a greater analytical handle. According to Padmanabhan: “This is important since some people in this field use computers the way a drunkard uses a lamppost - for support, not illumination. ” Padmanabhan contributed significantly to this direction by employing a wide range of tools in theoretical physics, which include, in particular, statistical mechanics. For instance, although the problem of cluster formation itself, in its entirety, is difficult to study analytically, Padmanabhan proposed a simple model in which one can divide the process of formation of structure into three convenient regimes. Each of these regimes was defined such that they could be independently dealt with reasonable analytical ease. He then proceeded to show how the results, in the three independent regimes, can be carefully combined to make predictions that are in good agreement with those from computer simulations. Such an approach shed more light on the underlying physics that drives the structure formation. Cosmological constant and the microstructure of spacetime: Observations show that our universe is expanding at an accelerated rate. The current accelerated expansion, in turn, seems to indicate that our universe is uniformly filled with a rather strange kind of energy called ‘Dark Energy’. Unlike other kinds of matter and energy, dark energy seems to create a sort of repulsive force at large scales, which tends to accelerate the expansion of our universe. It turns out that the effect of a uniform distribution of dark energy is mathematically equivalent to introducing a certain fundamental constant to Einstein’s field equations of general theory relativity. In this picture, dark energy is viewed as the manifestation of a new fundamental constant for our universe, called the cosmological constant. Moreover, to best explain the current observations, the cosmological constant must be a very small positive value, in a suitable unit. On the other hand, according to the principles of quantum field theory (QFT), which is another pillar of theoretical physics, the ‘vacuum’ has a certain energy content and this energy has the same effect as that of a cosmological constant. I should caution that the term ‘vacuum’ technically means the lowest energy state of a system. Moreover, due to quantum effects, the ‘vacuum’ in QFT, unlike the vacuum in the English dictionary(vacuum = a space entirely devoid of matter), has a richer structure. Consequently, the vacuum, according to QFT, must have a certain energy which is referred to as the ‘vacuum energy’. Since this vacuum energy also has an effect similar to the introduction of a cosmological constant, a certain fraction of the observed value of the cosmological constant must be the contribution from the vacuum energy. The problem, however, is that theoretically, this contribution seems to be gigantically larger than the observed value of the cosmological constant! This embarrassing disagreement between the observed value of the cosmological constant and the theoretical value of vacuum energy is referred to as the cosmological constant problem. According to Padmanabhan, to resolve the cosmological constant problem, one must start by admitting that at the deeper level, spacetime is not the fundamental object describing gravity. Spacetime and gravity, according to Padmanabhan, must emerge from more fundamental microscopic structures. This is similar to how a large number of microscopic H2O molecules interact to form the emergent fluid that we call water. He also claimed, with compelling reasons, that a deeper theory of gravity should be sensitive to only the fluctuations of the vacuum energy, instead of the vacuum energy itself. In this framework, one should identify the cosmological constant with the fluctuations of the vacuum energy, instead of the total vacuum energy itself, which we already saw was gigantically large.  This furnishes a compelling approach for resolving the cosmological constant problem, which is still being seriously explored by many researchers across the world. Note that fluids, which is an example of emergent phenomena, are described to some extent by a set of equations called the Navier-Stokes equations. Moreover, the presence of microscopic structure also implies that one can ascribe thermodynamic properties to these fluids. These thermodynamic quantities, in turn, must also satisfy certain thermodynamic identities. On the other hand, we have already seen that the dynamics of spacetime is described by Einstein’s field equations. To summarize, while emergent objects are characterized by certain kinds of features and related equations, gravity (or equivalently spacetime) is described by, what seems like, a totally different kind of equations. How does one reconcile this with the fact that spacetime (gravity) is emergent? Padmanabhan and his collaborators showed that Einstein’s general relativity itself already contains strong evidence for the claim that spacetime is emergent. For example, they showed that when Einstein’s equations are suitably reformulated, it takes the form of the Navier-Stokes equation! In addition, in a different setting, Einstein’s equations also acquire the form of thermodynamic identities! They also demonstrated that this is a feature of a larger class of theories of gravity that are extensions of Einstein’s general relativity. This, clearly, can be considered as a strong hint of the emergent nature of spacetime and hence, gravity. This raises the deeper question: If spacetime is emergent, like say water, what is its microscopic structure, analogous to how water consists of microscopic H20 molecules? In his last decade, Padmanabhan had constantly considered this question, the answer to which would revolutionize physics forever. He also believed that the difficulties with combining quantum theory with gravity primarily arise because one usually assumes spacetime as the fundamental variable to describe gravity, while it is actually only an emergent variable. The answer to the above question could also lead to the simultaneous resolution of two of the most fundamental challenges in theoretical physics: (1) formulating a quantum theory of gravity and (2) the cosmological constant problem. If experimental and theoretical confirmation of Padmanabhan’s revolutionary perspective on gravity emerges in the future, it would mark the third significant paradigm shift in our understanding of gravity, following Newton’s law of gravitation and Einstein’s general theory of relativity!

    "title": "What is CosmicVarta?",
    "body": "2021/11/13 -  CosmicVarta is a team effort where we all come together to discuss astronomy and related tools and ideas. Come join us on this journey!  Astronomy is truly a global subject. The boundaries between nations, people and ethnicities do not exist for astronomers. Astronomers and astrophysicists strive to study the cosmos in the hope of understanding and realizing our place in the Universe. Thus it is the responsibility of astronomers to convey what is found in our studies to the general public. Many news platforms and science popularization websites do a wonderful job of letting the public know about the final results from a few studies that are carried out in certain reputed astronomy institutes. But a vast majority of exciting research that is done in many universities and institutes throughout India never come outside of the scientific community. Professional astronomers give a detailed description of all their studies including how it was conducted and how they came to conclusions about astronomical objects from their studies in peer-reviewed scientific journals. But these articles are written in a highly scientific language and it is full of jargon. This makes the content incomprehensible to not only the interested reader but also to novice students who are not dealing with the subject on a day-to-day basis. But we want every interested individual to have a glimpse of the exciting life of astronomers. To do so we have started this platform to connect all astronomers and astrophysicists in India with the general public. Here, researchers will explain the work that goes on in their laboratories or in their research area (not just the results but how the conclusion was reached, what happens with all the data that is obtained from satellites and telescopes, why do we build bigger and better instruments et cetera) in a non-technical language. While we can make videos and explain what we do, we need to acknowledge that not everyone is comfortable in front of the camera, but what every PhD student/researcher is comfortable with is writing. Thus, through CosmicVarta, we intend to present the content published in scientific journals in a simplified yet detailed way so that people from every background can grasp the essence of the results. Articles on CosmicVarta can even help students understand the concept in a non-technical way before they go on to read the original article published in scientific journals. We also plan on publishing interviews with eminent professors and scientists as well as students working in the field of astronomy and astrophysics all over India. Thus prospective students can use this platform to find guidance and understand what to expect when entering this field. Apart from positions in astronomy and astrophysics in prominent research institutions, research in astronomy in India is carried out in various state, central and deemed universities as well. Through this portal, prospective students may also find information regarding them. This platform will also serve as an information hub regarding various software and databases that are available to be used by the public for free. The idea of CosmicVarta was found to be interesting by a wide variety of people we discussed with which indeed is very encouraging. We want to thank all the researchers who have contributed to the website by writing about their own papers or papers in their field before we even went live! We request all our readers to connect with us and even share their ideas for improving the platform. We also request all researchers involved in astronomy and astrophysics in India to write about their work and contribute towards popularizing astronomical research. Finally, and most importantly, just join us on a journey that will take you to the wonderful world of stars, galaxies, and beyond; and feel enthralled by the unlocking of the keys to the mysteries of the universe which scientists are doing on a daily basis.
