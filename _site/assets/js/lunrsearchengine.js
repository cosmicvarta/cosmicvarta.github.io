    "body": " What is CosmicVarta?Astronomy is truly a global subject. The boundaries between the nations, people, ethnicities do not exist for astronomers. We all think of the entire humankind as one. Hence, it becomes necessary and a responsibility for professional astronomers to present a platform where the authentic research being carried out is presented and discussed in language which a non-expert individual can understand. Moreover, while high quality research is communicated through the reputed journals, the students who are not dealing with the subject on a day to day basis might find it difficult to grasp. We thought over this problem and came up with CosmicVarta as an online platform where we simplify the current astronomical research being carried out so that people from every background can grasp the essence of the results. CosmicVarta is intended to be a portal where the current research is presented in a simplified way and subsequently discussed by people so that everyone can have a glimpse into the exciting world of astronomical research. Through this portal, we will present reviews of recently published articles, interviews with the eminent scientists working in the field of astronomy and astrophysics all over India and also serve as a platform to discuss the research in a simplified manner. Research in astronomy is pursued at only a handful of research institutes, hence prospective students may often find it challenging to find relevant information. Through this portal you may find information regarding the various career options available, various positions available at astronomy institutes in India and other related information. This portal will also serve as an information hub regarding various softwares and databases that are available to be used by the public for free. We can even help students who are looking for short term projects using such a huge volume of data by connecting with the scientists working actively in that area of research. Come join us on a journey which will take you to the wonderful world of stars, galaxies and beyond; and feel enthralled by unlocking the keys to the mysteries of the universe which the scientists are doing on a daily basis. Who are we?We are a group of enthusiastic young researchers, mostly PhD scholars in astrophysics, who wish to make available lndian astronomy research to all interested minds. We keep a track of recent research papers published by lndian astronomers. Their works are written in simple language and published for others to read, understand, enjoy and perhaps motivate them to pursue astronomy research in the future. Allow us to introduce ourselves :)   Anusha R: I’m Anusha. I’m a Ph. D. scholar at the University of Western Ontario. My research mainly focuses on emission-line stars in general relating line properties, formation mechanism, statistical analysis depending on stellar parameters and the circumstellar environment, their disk physics. I am currently working on spectroscopic analysis of Disk forming hot stars and photometric analysis of the effect of binarity on the disk properties. I also perform polarimetric studies on these disk-forming stars exploring their geometry and kinematics as a group. Personally, I am a fanatic of crime thrillers. I’m a classical dancer, blogger, science communicator/enthusiast. I spend quite a good time writing about things I personally admire, from fan-fiction to genetics/cognitive abilities/psychology, etcetera.   Ketan Rikame: I am a PhD student at CHRIST (Deemed to be University). Field of Instrumentation has always fascinated me and it has been my primary research interest. However, while working with various astronomy instruments, I also got interested in learning about the underlying physical phenomenon these instruments try to study. I have previously worked in optical and radio instrumentation. I am currently part of the instrumentation team at RRI and we are building an X-ray polarimeter approved to be launched on ISRO’s dedicated satellite mission XPOSAT. I also study accretion powered pulsars which will be one of the primary scientific targets of our X-RAY polarimeter. I am very much interested in science popularization. Although not involved in any such activity right now, I love to talk to people about my research (and not bore them hopefully). I love to listen/read about fascinating research other researchers are doing. I also love football!   Lakshitha Nama: Hello. My name is Lakshitha Nama. I am a PhD student at Christ (Deemed to be University). My PhD research aims at understanding the relationship between magnetic field and the elemental abundances in the outer atmosphere of Sun and other main sequence stars. I make use of imaging and spectroscopic data from X-ray telescopes. My hobbies including reading and painting.   Vivek Kumar Jha: Hi everyone. I am Vivek. I am a Ph. D student at ARIES, Nainital. My research so far has been about understanding the inner regions of active galaxies.  My PhD thesis is aimed at resolving the inner (sub-parsec) regions of these objects through multi-band observations and infer the structure and kinematics of matter in those locations.  I am also interested in exploring the various all-sky surveys which provide huge amounts of data to be accessed publicly. When not doing research, I usually go trekking in the neighbouring mountains or spend some time listening to classical music. You may find more about me here Acknowledgements:: We thank the Astronomical Society of India (ASI) for supporting our initiative as a part of their golden anniversary celebrations (#ASI50).

    "title": "Futuristic gravitational wave observations to resolve dichotomy of compact objects",
    "body": "2021/12/11 -  Gravitational waves are invisible ripples in space travel at the speed of light. It is generated in different scenarios, such as when two celestial bodies orbit around each other, an isolated body with tri-axial symmetry spins, inhomogeneity in matter distribution in the early universe, etc. Gravitational-wave astronomy aims to study these waves to improve the understanding of objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, events such as supernovae, and processes including those of the early universe shortly after the Big Bang. The article describes how futuristic gravitational wave observatories can be used to resolve the dichotomy of compact objects.  Historically, astronomy primarily relies on electromagnetic radiation. Over the past hundred years, various interesting astronomical objects have been discovered with gamma-ray detectors to radio telescopes. In recent years, gravitational wave astronomy has opened a new window to probe various exciting objects, and we can now look into the universe from a very different perspective. LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave detectors have so far made tens of detections from the merger of various compact objects. These are ground-based detectors operating at frequencies more than 1 Hz. As time progresses, these detectors have been upgraded continuously to increase their sensitivities so that we can look objects residing at further distances. Moreover, around 2035, a space-based gravitational wave mission, LISA is planned to launch, which would operate at less than 1 Hz frequency. Many interesting objects such as galactic binaries, massive binaries, extreme mass ratio inspirals, etc. , emit gravitational radiation at less than 1 Hz frequencies. Hence the current ground-based detectors cannot detect these objects, and LISA is planned to probe them. It is important to note that none of these objects are isolated in nature. Recently, a group of researchers have claimed that LISA might detect some isolated compact objects too. The term compact objects primarily represent white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. White dwarfs are the end state of stars with mass less than (10&#177;2) M⊙, where M⊙ ~2 x 1030 kg is the mass of the sun, in which the hydrogen fusion has stopped. One such object is the super-Chandrasekhar white dwarf. Over the past couple of decades, various researchers have detected more than a dozen over-luminous type Ia supernovae. Based on these observations, they have inferred that these supernovae have to be originated from massive white dwarfs, which violate the standard Chandrasekhar mass limit of 1. 4 M⊙. As a result, these objects are often termed as super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs. It has been shown that if a white dwarf possesses strong magnetic fields at the center, such white dwarfs can indeed hold mass more than 1. 4 M⊙. Moreover, if such a white dwarf rotates in such a way that there is a misalignment between its magnetic and rotation axes, it can emit continuous gravitational waves. These researchers have explicitly shown that if a white dwarf has a strong central field but a weaker field at its surface, LISA can detect it within 1 year of detection period. On the other hand, if the white dwarf possesses a strong surface field or a weak central field, LISA will not be able to detect it. However, such white dwarfs can be detected by some other futuristic detectors, such as BBO, DECIGO, etc. In this way, LISA can directly confirm the existence of super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs (Fig. 1). Note that signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is proportional to the square root of observation time (T) such that S/N increases with the observation time and the signal is more likely to be detected (see Section 1. 4 of Sieniawska &amp; Bejger, 2019, Universe 5, 217). This likeliness of detection is due to the increase in observation period and not due to the increase in sensitivity of the detectors. If S/N &GreaterEqual; 5, such a signal can be detected by a gravitational wave detector (see Section~2. 1 of Pitkin, 2011, MNRAS, 415, 1849).   (a) Poloidally dominated white dwarf.   (b) Toroidally dominated white dwarf Figure 1: Gravitational wave S/N as a function of integration time for a white dwarf with central density= 2 × 1010 g cm−3. The thick orange line corresponds to &lt;S/N&gt; ≈ 5. Gravitational wave astronomy is also helpful to resolve the dichotomy of some other objects too. There are some isolated compact objects, named soft gamma repeater~(SGR) and anomalous X-ray pulsar~(AXP), which are mostly believed to be neutron stars as they are found to be associated with supernova remnants. However, some of them do not have a supernova remnant association, and their magnetic field is also unknown. Hence, some researchers have also shown that some of their features can be explained assuming they are white dwarfs. To resolve this controversy, the researchers have shown that gravitational wave astronomy is also a helpful tool. It was shown that if they are neutron stars, no proposed gravitational wave detector can detect them. On the other hand, if they are white dwarfs, they can be detected by BBO and DECIGO detectors within 1 year of detection period.

    "body": "2021/11/17 -  One of the science goals of the Aditya L1 is to map the coronal magnetic field topology. The infrared channel of the VELC payload of the Aditya L1 is equipped with a spectropolarimeter to perform full stokes spectropolarimetric observations in the Fe XIII 1074. 7 nm line to measure the vector magnetic field. This article discusses the design and the working of the spectropolarimeter of the VELC. This article also discusses the challenges associated with the spectropolarimeter of the VELC, which are to optimize the data volume to be sent to the ground as no onboard data processing is planned, and the other is to account for the change in polarimeter characteristic due to mismatch in retarder rotation frequency and the length of signal detection time.  Aditya L1 is the first Indian space-based Solar observatory that will continuously observe the Sun to study coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, coronal magnetometry, origin, and monitoring of near-UV solar radiation. It is equipped with seven payloads. One of the payloads is Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC), developed by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) to study the diagnostic parameters of solar corona and dynamics and origin of Coronal Mass Ejections and magnetic field measurement of the solar corona. A coronagraph is a telescopic instrument that blocks the light of a star so that the nearby objects which would otherwise be hidden in the star’s glare be resolved. A solar coronagraph occults the bright solar disc to resolve the corona. The VELC is equipped with a spectrograph as a backend instrument. A spectrograph disperses the polychromatic light and records the intensities over a range of wavelengths called the spectrum. We study the properties of the spectrum to estimate the plasma parameters like velocity, electron density, temperature, etc.   Figure 1: A LASCO C2 Coronagraph. LASCO consists of three coronagraphs (C1/C2/C3) onboard NASA’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory satellite. Image courtesy: NASA The VELC is designed to record spectra simultaneously in three spectral lines at 530. 3 nm due to Fe XIV (green channel), 789. 2 nm due to Fe XI (red channel), and 1074. 7 nm due to Fe XIII (IR channel). It is a multi-slit spectrograph (4 equispaced slits) covering the FOV up to 1. 5R⊙, where R⊙ is the radius of the Sun. The IR channel is equipped with a polarimeter to carry out full Stokes polarimetric observations of the Fe XIII line. The polarisation of electromagnetic waves refers to the path or the locus of the electric field vector. If the electric field oscillates in a single direction, it is called linear polarisation. If the electric field rotates in a circular plane as the light travels forward, it is called circular polarisation. The plasma’s magnetic field information is encoded in the polarisation of the spectral lines via the Zeeman effect and the Hanle effect. The Zeeman effect is the splitting of the spectral line in the presence of an external magnetic field. The Zeeman splitting of the spectral line gives rise to three spectral components, 𝞼+, 𝞼-, and 𝜋 components, which are right circularly polarised, left circularly polarised, and linearly polarised, respectively. If the magnetic field is along the line of sight, in that case, only the 𝞼+, 𝞼- components are observed. If the magnetic field is perpendicular to the line of sight (LOS), all three components are observed as linearly polarised. Also, the separation between these components, an observable quantity, is directly related to the magnitude of the magnetic field. Hence by measuring the polarisation in spectral lines, we can estimate both the magnitude and the direction of the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere.   Figure 2: Subfigure (a) shows the break in the degeneracy between magnetic sublevels in the presence of an external magnetic field, and this break or split of the levels produces three spectral components (𝞼+, 𝞼-, and 𝜋). In subfigure (b), we see if the magnetic field is perpendicular to LOS, then 𝞼+, 𝞼-, and 𝜋 components are observed as linearly polarized. In the subfigure (c), the magnetic field direction is into the plane of the screen (i. e. , along the line of sight), therefore only 𝞼+, 𝞼- components are observed as right and left circularly polarized respectively. Image courtesy: Author The Hanle effect is observed when the splitting or separation between energy levels of a spectral line, in the presence of an external magnetic field, is less than or equal to the natural width of that line. The anisotropic radiation coming from the underlying photosphere or chromosphere gets scattered by the atoms in the upper layers like the transition region and corona (TR-corona). This scattering process leads to linear polarization of the emitted spectral lines. This is valid even when there is no external magnetic field. Now, in the weak magnetic field regions such as TR-corona (where expected field strength is 1 to 300 Gauss), there will be a modification of the scattering or linear polarization as well as rotation of the plane of linear polarization of the emitted lines. This effect of modification in the line polarization is called the Hanle effect. By measuring this change in the polarization of the lines, the weak magnetic field can be estimated in the TR-corona of the sun. As described above, we can estimate the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere by measuring the polarization in spectral lines. A polarimeter is an instrument used to measure polarization. A polarimeter consists of a polarization modulator and a linear polarizer/analyzer. First, the unpolarized light from the Sun enters the polarization modulator which changes the state of input polarization. Then the polarized light from the modulator enters the linear polarizer which cuts the intensity of light perpendicular to its orientation. Hence, we measure at the detector the intensity allowed by the linear polarizer, which in turn depends on the output from the polarization modulator, which in turn depends on the polarization state of the input light of the Sun. By measuring at the detector the output intensity of the incident light of the Sun through the polarimeter and knowing the characteristics of the polarimeter, we can estimate the input polarization.   Figure 3: Figure showing a Retarder acting as a Polarization Modulator and Linear polarizer acting as an analyzer. Image courtesy: Introduction to Spectropolarimetry The VELC polarimeter consists of a continuously rotating wave plate (RWP) followed by a polarizing beam displacer (PBD) as the polarization analyzer. The PBD produces two beams that are orthogonally polarized, which are simultaneously recorded by the detector. This setup is commonly known as a dual-beam polarimeter. The main advantage of dual-beam setup is to reduce the spurious polarisation, i. e. , cross-talk from Stokes I to Q, U, and V. The light enters the polarimeter setup (RWP + PBD), and a frame is recorded on the detector. Then RWP is rotated by an angle, and another frame is recorded. To measure the four Stokes parameters (I, Q, U, and V), a minimum of 4 such measurements, called samples, are required at different orientations of RWP. This is called modulation of the polarization state of light. One modulation cycle constitutes 4 samples per half rotation of the wave plate, so one complete rotation of the RWP provides 2 modulation cycles. Due to the limited number of photons in the solar corona, large integration times are required to build the required signal-to-noise ratio. Signal to noise ratio (SNR) is the ratio of the desired signal strength to the background noise level. When SNR is low, we need to add the signal for many time intervals (integration time), which adds up the signal and reduces or cancels the noise as the noise is assumed random. It poses several challenges concerning the polarimeter of the VELC. One of them is the increased data volume to be sent to the ground station as no on-board data processing is planned. The second is the change in the polarimeter characteristic. In typical polarimeters, first RWP rotates, then the detector frame is recorded, However, in the case of VELC, the RWP rotates, and the detector records independently of each other. There is a mismatch between the retarder’s rotation frequency and the length of the signal detection time, which causes a change in the characteristic of the polarimeter after one cycle of measurements. Nagaraju and the team discuss the above problems and suggest a potential solution to optimize the data volume and account for the change in polarimeter characteristics in successive modulation cycles. To optimize the data volume, Nagaraju and the team discuss the optimal efficiencies of measuring Stokes parameters as a function of the number of samples per half rotation (n) of the wave plate (RWP) and provide efficiencies when the retarder’s rotation frequency does not match the signal detection time. They find that efficiency slowly increases with an increase in the number of samples per half rotation of the wave plate. They find that the increase in efficiency of measuring Stokes I and Stokes U is close to 10% for the case of n=5 to n=95, for Stokes Q, it is about 8%, and for Stokes V, it is about 4%. However, as the number of samples per half rotation will increase from n=5 to n=95, the data size will proportionally increase, and this will offset any gains in efficiency. They estimate the data size of 3. 14 Mb per second for n=4 to 74. 19 Mb per second for n=95. Hence they suggest that the number of modulation steps or the samples per half rotation be chosen by considering the data volume and other measurement aspects.   Image courtesy: Original article Nagaraju and the team discuss the change in the elements of polarimeter characteristics with time to understand the effect of the mismatch between retarder rotation frequency and signal detection time. They model this change for the different number of samples per half rotation of the wave plate. They find a cyclical/periodic variation in the elements with time. They find that the larger the time difference between the retarder rotation frequency and signal detection time, the faster is the variation in the elements of polarimeter characteristics with time. Despite the significant variation in individual elements, the efficiency of measuring Stokes parameters does not change significantly throughout integration time. They suggest this change in the elements of the polarimeter characteristics can be taken into account through calibration. They notice that the elements corresponding to measuring Stokes Q and Stokes U vary two times faster than elements corresponding to measuring Stokes V. Hence, recording the calibration data to cover one entire cycle within which elements of polarimeter characteristics corresponding to measuring Stokes V complete one period of variation may suffice.   Image courtesy: Original article Hence, they find that the data volume can be optimized by choosing an appropriate number of samples per half rotation of the wave plate (RWP) without significantly affecting the efficiency of the Stokes parameters. The variation of elements of polarimeter characteristic with time is also addressed due to a mismatch between the retarder rotation frequency and signal detection time, and a potential solution is suggested.

    "title": "Deciphering The Mysteries of The Quiet Sun Explosions",
    "body": "2021/10/17 -  XSM onboard Chandrayaan 2 observed the Sun during its minimum activity period in 2019-2020. Using this data, the researchers have for the first time detected a very large number of small scale explosions, called microflares, happening on the Sun. The physical parameters of the microflares have been calculated and their spatial location is also detected using various satellites. The study also gives evidence that such small scale heating events occur everywhere on the Sun and they contribute to coronal heating.  The outer atmosphere (the corona) of the Sun poses a long standing mystery regarding its temperature. The solar corona is composed of plasma (ionised gas) that emits strongly in X-rays and ultraviolet radiation. Its temperature exceeds a million degree kelvin, while the visible surface (the photosphere) is at 6000K. One of the theories to understand the so-called ‘coronal heating problem’ proposes the occurrence of a large number of small scale explosions (known as microflares and nanoflares) on the Sun. It is known that these flares are a manifestation of the magnetic field of the Sun that is generated in its interior. But the Sun’s magnetic field is not constant, it varies with an average period of 11 years, which is known as the solar cycle. Approximately every 11 years, the Sun’s magnetic field reverses. In other words, the north pole becomes the south pole, and vice versa. The flip of the poles is an end product of the slow evolution of Sun’s magnetic field over time. As the cycle progresses, all of the Sun’s activities related to its magnetic field (such as sunspots, flares, coronal mass ejections) builds to a maximum (when the magnetic field reverses). Then the Sun settles back down to a minimum, before the whole cycle starts again. The Sun was in a very low state of activity during the minima of solar cycle 24 covering the year 2019. It was in fact the quietest the Sun has been in the last 100 years! During this quiet period of the Sun, at the mid of the year 2019, Chandrayaan 2 was launched with the several instruments/payloads to observed our moon and the Sun. Among them CLASS is an instrument to understand the abundance of elements present on the moon. But this requires knowledge of the X-rays emitted from the Sun. Thus, the orbiter also carried an instrument called Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM). XSM observed the Sun during its deepest minima of solar cycle 24, covering the year 2019-2020 with a good temporal and energy resolution. Using observations during this time, Santosh Vadawale and his team has uncovered some fascinating information about the quiescent Sun. They have shown that during this period small scale transients, so-called microflares (smaller counterpart of the conventional solar flares) are occurring everywhere on the solar disk. Solar flares are eruptions of electromagnetic radiation of all wavelengths from the Sun. They last from a few minutes to a few hours. Flares are classified depending on the energy they release during its peak in the soft X rays. Though the number of large flares increase with the progress of the solar cycle, this study suggested that small flares, called microflares, keep exploding on the Sun at all times. Though the definition of microflares has varied though the years due to the sensitivity of the instrument, in this study flares having a peak flux below 10-8 W/m2 are considered as microflares. During this period of extremely quiet solar corona when no active regions were present on the disk, Santosh Vadawale and team identified a total of 98 microflares from 76 days. The microflares are marked in the lightcurve (Figure 1). Most of the microflares were seen to behave similar to larger flares having a fast rise and a slow decay. Some microflares did not follow this behaviour possibly due to blending of multiple microflares or they intrinsically have a different origin. The temperature and emission measure of these microflares are determined. Temperature tells how hot the plasma gets during the explosion while the emission measure gives an idea about the density of plasma emitted at that particular temperature. The temperature is found to be between 3-6 MK and the emission measure is in the order of 1046 cm-3.  Figure 1: XSM lightcurve during the period of deepest solar minima of the past century. Red vertical lines indicate the detected microflares outside the conventional active regions. Image source: S. Vadawale et al. , 2021. The XSM microflare locations are identified in the extreme ultraviolet images obtained from NASA’s ‘Solar Dynamics Observatory’ and from the X-ray images obtained by the Japanese HINODE X-ray Telescope. Most microflares were seen to be associated with X-ray Bright Points. ‘Solar Dynamics Observatory’ HMI magnetograms were used to analyse the corresponding photospheric magnetic field. They observed the microflares to be associated with magnetic bipolar regions having weaker field strengths, which indicates magnetic reconnection happening at smaller scales (Figure 2).

This is also the first statistical survey of X-ray microflares outside active regions. By plotting the frequency distribution of microflares, the team has given evidence for the hypothesis that small scale heating events occur everywhere on the Sun and they contribute to coronal heating.

    "title": "The First Theoretical Model of the Near-Surface Shear Layer of the Sun",
    "body": "2021/10/12 -  It is well known that the Sun rotates differentially, i. e. its equator rotates faster than the pole. Not only at the surface, but the solar rotation profile also varies with the radius, which was discovered in helioseismic observation. This observation reveals an exciting feature close to the visible solar surface that the rotation profile of the Sun changes very sharply, which is named as Near-Surface Shear Layer (NSSL). In this work astronomers from ARIES and IISc have given the theoretical explanation for the existence of NSSL very the first time. They have used the thermal wind balance equation to explain the existence of NSSL.  The Sun, our life-giving star, has always been a star of many interests. Its importance for the living beings made many astronomers turn their telescope towards the Sun just after the advent of the telescope by Galileo Galilei. The early and regular observations of the Sun revealed the presence of dark spots, now known as sunspots, and 11 years of periodic variation in their number of appearances, popularly known as the solar cycle. The systematic observations of sunspots also show that the solar surface rotates differentially, which means the equator of the Sun spins faster than its pole. However, the internal rotation of the Sun has only been revealed after the helioseismology (technique of using sound waves to peek inside the Sun) era. Helioseismology has answered the many puzzling questions about the Sun while raising many questions about our nearest star at the same time. One of the crucial observations that helioseismology has made was the existence of the near-surface shear layer (NSSL).  The NSSL is the region very close to the visible solar surface, where there is a sharp change in the rotation profile of the Sun. The understanding of NSSL is crucial for the Sun, but it will also help us understand the other stars. Many researchers had indicated the presence of such a layer in the past based on solar surface observations but the real inference has been provided only after helioseismic measurements. Here in this work, researchers from ARIES, Nainital and IISc Bangalore have given the theoretical explanation for the existence of NSSL, for the very first time. Their study used the thermal wind balance equation, which tells about how the slight difference in temperature between solar poles and equator, which is called thermal wind term, is balanced by the centrifugal force appearing due to solar differential rotation. Now, the question is, why are they expecting the solar pole to have a slightly higher temperature? To understand this, we have to think about the motion of plasma blobs or convective blobs in the solar convection zone in which heat is transported by convection in the same way as it is transported in boiling water. Unlike boiling water, the Sun is rotating, and hence the upward moving blobs will experience Coriolis force. The effect of Coriolis force is zero on blobs moving along the axis of rotation (as in the case of a pole) and will be maximum when they are moving perpendicular to it (as in the case of the equator). Therefore, the heat transfer will be more efficient along the axis of rotation, leading to a higher temperature near the pole which drives the plasma from pole to equator. Another term is called centrifugal, which arises due to solar differential rotation driving the plasma in the opposite direction that is equator to pole. The temperature profile of the Sun shows a sharp decrease near the visible surface and authors have shown that the pole-equator temperature difference also decreases as we approach the surface. To balance these effects Solar rotation profile (centrifugal term) has to change sharply, giving rise to NSSL. Most scientists believe that this condition is valid only in the interior of the Sun, and it does not hold near the solar surface. In their work, the authors have shown that this belief actually holds near the surface as well. They have noted that if this condition is true near the solar surface it can explain the existence of NSSL which is inferred in helioseismology based observation.

    "body": "2021/10/12 -  Starting from the history of star classification in the millinniums, this interesting note will take you through some of the very basic concepts on emission-line stars. You will be able to understand what they are and why these type of stars are my special children. The article will pose a number of very fundamental yet unresolved questions on these groups waiting to be unraveled from the nature. PS: You will not regret opening this link!   Figure 1: The most comprehensive Hubble deep field image of the evolving universe. Image source:Hubblesite . Author’s note:  I can stare all day at the image above showing details of a large number of Galaxies and stars which are the building blocks of the visible universe we know. The expanding universe, the infrared afterglow, litter from the most distant parts of our universe, remind me of the nearer still, the largely unaffected bounty of the space in my presence. Even being an ignorant survival, these depths and darkness leading one to their origin are intriguing. Introduction:: The best way to understand a system is to observe and question their behavior leading to logical reasons. In this manner, for ages, many incredible minds have corroborated the nature of stars, observed them over years, mapped their positions to good accuracy, and questioned their fundamentals, for many which even today we do not know answers to. As a first step towards this process, we explore the different types of stars and their nature using the stellar spectral classification. Stellar classification:: The oldest ever known catalogue of stars in the sky dates back to the 2nd millennium BC (1531- 1155 BC), which upgraded in number over years. But, the catalogued stars were classified into different categories based on their observable properties only by the late 19th century. Through observations, we understand that stars differ in colour and temperature. To understand these observable differences, we categorized stars based on their temperature into different ‘stellar spectral types’, assigning one alphabet for each class. The sequence of stars presently adopted, begins with the hottest stars, class O, and proceeds from hot to cool in the order: O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. Most of the stars in the visible universe can be classified into one of these groups.   Figure 2: The HR-diagram of stellar classifications. The X-axis shows different spectral types from hot massive O stars to cooler M stars. Image source: Astronomytrek . Hot massive stars usually include stars in the spectral type range O to A. It is interesting though that the physical properties, internal structure, chemical nature, and the observables of hotter stars are very different from that of their cooler counterparts. A special category of these hot stars is the emission-line stars which show prominent emission features in their spectrum. A closer look into this category reveals that not all hot massive stars show emission-line signatures. To date, we have insufficient details to explain why this nature is not universal. Many interesting studies have been conducted to date in examining the observational properties and statistical nature of these emission-line stars. What do we know about emission-line stars?: As mentioned earlier, the term emission-line stars (ELS) denote stellar objects that show emission features in their spectrum. In general, hot ELS include Classical Ae/Be type stars, Herbig Ae/Be type stars, Wolf-Rayet stars, supergiants, etc. The mechanism of the emission-line formation differs between each of these classes. Taking into consideration Classical Ae/Be stars, a group of ELS enclosing hot massive Oe, Be, and Ae stars (where ‘e’ stands for emission). The emission lines in this group of stars are known to originate from a cooler disk-shaped envelope surrounding the star. The disk is composed of ionized gas and surrounds the star equatorially. The mechanism of such a gaseous equatorial disk formation is termed the Be phenomenon.   Figure 3: An artistic impression of a Classical Be star. Note the presence of a circumstellar envelope in the shape of a disk surrounding the star. Image source: Wikimedia commons . Classical Be and Classical Ae stars: As mentioned earlier, I consider Classical Be (CBe hereafter) and Classical Ae (CAe hereafter) stars as one of the very interesting classes of objects. After 150+ years of their first detection, these stars still pose a great challenge in understanding them completely. The most fundamental (yet unresolved) question about these stars is that, Why do these stars form a circumstellar disk? It has to be noted that not all B-type stars are CBe stars, not all A-type stars CAe stars. Why do we see a selection for this emission mechanism in nature?. The better we study these stars in detail, the better we get to understand them. This research article titled Identification of new Classical Ae stars in the Galaxy using LAMOST DR5 intends at compiling the very first homogeneous catalogue of the CAe stars from our Galaxy. Identification of Classical Ae stars. : This article makes use of one of the largest spectroscopic databases of the Galaxy – Large sky Area Multi-Object fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), undertaken by the Chinese academy of sciences, situated at Xinglong Station, China. They identified about 4,789 A-type emission-line stars (Hα shows emission profile) from the LAMOST database. As quoted previously, many types of objects can show this emission feature. To identify the CAe stars, they made use of the infra-red photometric properties. The idea behind this selection is that the circumstellar disk of CBe/CAe stars will give rise to additional flux excess in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. By filtering out stars showing this additional flux, the team identified 159 new CAe stars from the Galaxy. CBe stars versus CAe stars: From Figure. 2 we understand that A-type stars are comparatively cooler than B-type stars.  Hence, the CAe stars are considered cooler counterparts of CBe stars. Though these systems show a similar presence of circumstellar disk, it is important to understand how their disk properties change concerning their temperature. This study provides a dedicated section on comparing the observed spectroscopic features of CBe stars and the CAe stars. They were able to predict that the CAe stars could host smaller disks compared to CBe stars. Apart from hydrogen, this study identified the presence of ionized metallic lines of FeII, Ca II, OI, etc in the spectra of the CAe stars and that these features are similar to that of CBe stars. This article provided new insights on the nature of the CAe stars and motivates the research community to study further study and compare them to CBe stars for a better understanding of the Be phenomenon.

    "title": "Twinkle twinkle little stars, should I wonder what you are? A brief account of variable stars",
    "body": "2021/10/12 -  Curiosity is what has driven mankind to observations of new phenomena. Every twinkling star in the night sky is definitely not due to the atmospheric refraction of earth. Rather, one might be looking at a variable star, each with a different origin story to tell. A study of variable stars enhances our understanding of the universe.  1. 	Introduction: One of the first nursery rhymes I might have been introduced to was the popular rhyme, “Twinkle twinkle little star”. Over the years, the verse took a different form once we were introduced to the astronomically correct idea of a star. Now the rhyme reads somewhat like below. Twinkle twinkle little starYou look small cause you are farLightyears out from here to thereYour light is distorted by the airSo you twinkle twinkle little star Elementary physics lectures have introduced us to the idea of atmospheric refraction, due to which observed starlight seems to vary in intensity. This phenomenon of twinkling is attributed to the varying densities of the atmosphere. However, not all twinkling stars attribute their twinkle to atmospheric refraction. Some twinkle due to their inherent properties. Such stars are called variable stars. The time scales associated with stellar evolution are generally so large that the Universe has been traditionally viewed as a static phenomenon. However, we have long known short human time scale events, such as Solar System events and stellar explosions. With the advent of robotically controlled telescopes and high cadence near all-sky monitoring in the last decade of the 1990s, the study of astronomical events on ever shorter time scales has exploded. With access to this new stream of data, our understanding of many phenomena has increased significantly. However, the number of unanswered questions have increased multiple times. One such question addressed the dilemma of why many celestial bodies varied in their brightness. This led to the study in the field of Time-Domain Astronomy and variable stars. 2. 	Time Domain Astronomy: Time domain astrophysics is a field of observational astronomy that studies the universe on all timescales from less than milliseconds to more than decades and at all wavelengths. This became possible due to the availability of great detectors and computing advances over the past decades. The idea of observations and analysis have now moved beyond the one-off photographic surveys in the past. Beginning from the 1990s, the MACHO(massive astrophysical compact halo object), OGLE(Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment), and SuperWASP projects used large field of view, highly sensitive cameras on manual or robotic optical or near-infrared telescopes and obtained deep digital images of large swathes of the sky. These scans were repeated to build up vast databases of time-resolved images. If we were to describe the elementary ideas of time-domain astronomy, we could explain it in the following manner. Observe a particular section of the sky. Note the physical limits visible in that section. After some time t, observe the area under consideration. If any of the physical quantities have changed from earlier, we tag the particular body in the database for future study. The time it takes for the instrument to re-observe the same patch of sky is referred to as the “cadence. ” The old strategy of looking deep and far into the Universe is used, and sources of a given brightness methodically mapped out in a three dimensional volume. In time-domain astronomy, sources that vary by some brightness with a rate equal to the inverse of the instrument cadence can be steadily mapped out. In a way, the time-domain adds another dimension, given by the frequency equal to the inverse cadence, to the properties of observed phenomena. The study of variable stars is an essential section of time-domain astronomy. 3. 	Variable Stars: Omicron Ceti was the first variable star to be identified in 1596 by David Fabricius. Johannes Holwards observed Omicron Ceti pulsating in a regular 11-month cycle in 1638. This discovery debunked the theory that the stars were eternal and invariable as ancient philosophers such as Aristotle had believed. Variable stars change in brightness over time. These changes can vary from as small as a few parts in a million or by a considerable factor. The changes observed can also range from a few milliseconds to a few years or decades, for that matter. Since many astronomical bodies can qualify as a “variable star”, an array of techniques are devised to discover and analyse the possibility of a variable star. The next obvious question is on the importance of studying variable stars. The study is of importance as the variations provide unique insights about nature, the origins, evolution and often the future trajectory of the star under observance. This information helps us deduce more fundamental knowledge about our universe. The variations may be due to the rotational motion executed by a spotted star, or due to a star being eclipsed by its companion star, or even by an unseen planet. The variations may also be due to the vibrations of a star. If these vibrations are complex, we might be able to get a rough picture of the internal structure and composition of this star. The variations may be due to eruptions on a star (flares), or an accretion disc (dwarf novae) or major explosions on a star (novae), or to the total disruption of a star in a supernova. Supernovae are one of the most violent incidents in the known universe. However, the existence of life is an indirect result of supernovae. They help to recycle the atoms created in stars into space. Some of these atoms became part of the Sun, others into planets, and for that matter, even the biosphere. It is deduced that the elements heavier than iron were mostly created in the supernova explosion. Supernovae may be dramatic and extreme, but they represent only one of the many roles that variable stars play in modern astrophysics and in our understanding of the universe and the processes which govern it. The organised study and recording of observations led to the establishment of the Variable Star Section of the British Astronomical Association (BAAVSS) in 1890, followed soon after by the establishment of variable star studies at Harvard College Observatory, which eventually led to the founding of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) in 1911. 4. 	Classification of Variable Stars: The General Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS) recommends an official classification system of variable stars based on:  Light Curve Temperature Luminosity Population typeBased on this system, a family tree of variable stars can be constructed. Such a tree is called a Variability Tree. A simplified version of the variability tree is given below.  Figure 1: Variability tree, denoting the various classes of variable stars. The image can be found here. The variable stars are classified into two groups based on the reason of variability in the observed intensities, Intrinsic and Extrinsic variable stars. They are further categorised into sub-classes, which are discussed below. 5. 	Intrinsic Variable Stars: Intrinsic variable stars vary their light output, hence their brightness, due to the physical variation in the star or stellar system. This type of star provides a large amount of information about the internal structure of the star that helps astronomers to model the stellar evolution. Pulsating stars and eruptive or cataclysmic variable stars belong to this category. 5. 1. 	Pulsating Variable StarsPulsating variables are the stars that show periodic expansion and contraction of their surface layers. The change in brightness occurs due to the change in size or shape. Most of the pulsating stars simply expand and contract repeatedly in a continuing cycle of size changes and this is known as the fundamental mode of pulsation. Some of the changes not only in their size but also in their internal arrangement of material. Some others vibrate in more than one way at the same time and this makes the system complex. Like most vibrating systems, pulsating variables repeat their changes and they tend to be periodic. Depending on the period, on the mass and evolutionary status of the star, pulsating variables are classified into many categories. We shall discuss each sub-category briefly. Cepheid variable starsCepheid variables form an important class of pulsating variables. These are large yellow stars pulsating with periods from 1 to 70 days, with an amplitude of light variation from 0. 1 to 2 magnitudes. They are very bright objects and have periodic oscillations. Cepheid light curves are distinctive and show a rapid rise in brightness followed by a more gradual decline that is shaped like a shark fin. The spectral class of Cepheid actually changes as it pulsates, being about an F type at maximum luminosity and down to G or K at minimum. Cepheids follow a period-luminosity relation. Period luminosity relationship states that ‘more luminous cepheids pulsated more slowly’. This concept was put forward by Henrietta Leavitt in 1912. The period of cepheid can be calculated from its light curve which can be used to estimate the Cepheid’s luminosity. Knowing its magnitude and luminosity we can calculate the distance using the relation m - M = 5 log(d/10) where m is the apparent magnitude, M the absolute magnitude and d the distance to the star in parsecs.   Figure 2: Light curve of cepheid Delta Cephei. The image can be found here. Long-period variables: One of the largest population of pulsating variables are the long-period variables (LPVS). They are pulsating red giants or supergiants with periods ranging from 30 to 1000 days. Long-period variables are further subdivided into two major subclasses, the Mira type and the semiregular variables. a. 	Mira variableThese are periodic red giant variables that vary with periods of 80 to 1000 days in magnitudes as high as 2. 5 in the visible bands. Mira type variables are red giant stars, often of enormous size. Their high luminosity means that they can be detected at large distances. Many of them are slowly ejecting a steady stream of matter into the surrounding space and this mass loss has dramatic consequences on their future evolution. They have weak outer layers in their atmosphere which gets heated from regular pulsations. These are interesting due to their similar size as the Sun and that they are undergoing a late stage of the same evolutionary path that all one-solar mass stars, including the Sun, will experience. b. 	Semi-regular variableSemiregular variables are giants or supergiants which show appreciable periodicity accompanied by semiregular or irregular light variation. Their periods range from 30 to 1000 days, generally with amplitude variations of fewer than 2. 5 magnitudes. RR LyraeRR Lyrae stars are of short period (. 05 to 1. 2 days), pulsating white giant stars, usually of spectral class A. They are older and less massive than Cepheids. The amplitude of variation of RR Lyrae is generally from . 3 to 2 magnitudes. RV Tauri StarRV Tauri stars are yellow supergiants having a characteristic light variation with deep and shallow minima. Their periods, defined as the interval between two deep minima range from 30 to 150 days. They show brightness variations of up to 3 magnitudes. Some of these stars show long term cyclic variations from hundreds of thousands of days. Generally, their spectral class ranges from G to K.   Figure 3: Light curve of RV Tauri star R Scuti. Image courtesy: Wikimedia commons 5. 2. 	Cataclysmic variable stars: Eruptive variables are stars varying in brightness because of violent outbursts caused by thermonuclear processes in their surface layers. They exhibit significant and rapid changes in their luminosity which is usually accompanied by mass outflow in the form of stellar winds of variable intensity. These are a system of two stars (binary system) orbiting very close to each other. One of them is a normal sunlike or giant star, while the other is a white dwarf. Some of the outermost material from the larger star is pulled away by the white dwarf’s gravity, but this material does not fall directly onto the white dwarf. Instead, it builds up in a disk called an accretion disk, which orbits the white dwarf. Thus, the eruptive variable star is a combination of normal or giant stars, white dwarf and accretion disk as shown in the following figure.   Figure 4: A cataclysmic variable star. The image can be found here. The combination of main-sequence or giant stars, white dwarf and accretion disk lead to celestial fireworks. So, instead of varying like pulsating variables, eruptive variables exhibit outbursts of activity. Some events may result in the destruction of the star while others can reoccur one or more times. These are called recurrent novae. The changes in their light curves are usually very unpredictable and tend to be sudden and dramatic. 5. 3. 	Supernovae: Supernovae are examples of such cataclysmic variable stars. These occur either during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion. The original object(progenitor) either collapses to a neutron star or black hole or gets destroyed. We will now look briefly into the types of supernovae. Type I supernovaeThese do not exhibit any hydrogen lines in spectra. Type Ia supernovae are understood to arise from white dwarf stars in a close binary system. As gas from the companion star accumulates on the white dwarf, the white dwarf is continuously undergoing compression. At the Chandrasekhar Limit, the white dwarf has accumulated too much mass to resist the force of gravity, thus setting off a runaway nuclear reaction inside. This leads to a cataclysmic supernova outburst. Type Ia supernovas are employed as “standard candles” to measure cosmic distances because they are believed to blaze with equal brightness at their peaks. Hence, they can be used as standard candles to determine the distance to a galaxy once the stretch factor is accounted for. Type II supernovaeA pre-requisite for a star to explode as a Type II supernova is that the star must be several times more massive than the sun (around 8 to 10 Msolar). Once the core of this star runs out of hydrogen and then helium at its core, it moves ahead with the nucleosynthesis process to create heavier metals. As a result, heavier elements accumulate at the centre, similar to a layered onion. Lighter elements are found in the outer regions of the star. Once the star’s core becomes heavier than the Chandrasekhar limit, the star begins to implode. This is why these supernovae are called core-collapse supernovae. Eventually, the core starts to heat up and becomes denser. The implosion bounces back off the core and expels the stellar material into space, forming the supernova. Type II supernovae show hydrogen lines in their early spectra. 6. 	Extrinsic Variable Stars: Extrinsic variable stars are those in which the light output changes due to some process external to the star itself. The two main classes of extrinsic stars are the eclipsing binaries and rotating variables. 6. 1. 	Eclipsing binariesEclipsing binaries are binary star systems whose members eclipse each other, blocking one another’s light. As a result, the system looks occasionally fainter to observers on earth. The light curve of an eclipsing binary depends on the sizes and brightness of the stars, their separation from each other and the geometry of view from the earth. The process of eclipsing and the corresponding light curve of an eclipsing system is shown in the figure below.   Figure 5: Eclipsing binary star. The image can be found here. 6. 2. 	Rotating starRotating variables are rapidly rotating stars, often in binary systems, that undergo small amplitude changes in light due to dark or bright spots on the star’s surface which is much similar to sunspots on the sun. Stars with sizeable sunspots show significant variations in brightness as they rotate. Stars that have ellipsoidal shapes also exhibit variation in brightness when they present varying areas of the surface to the observer. 7. 	Conclusion: Curiosity is what has driven mankind to observations of new phenomena. Every twinkling star in the night sky is definitely not due to the atmospheric refraction of earth. Rather, one might be looking at a variable star, each with a different origin story to tell. A study of variable stars enhances our understanding of the universe. Cepheid variables help in determining distances to galaxies and determining the age of the Universe. Mira variables help us in making an understanding of the future evolution of the Sun. Accretion disks in cataclysmic variables help us to understand the activity inside active galaxies with supermassive black holes. Type Ia supernovae have helped us conclude on the accelerated expansion of the Universe by acting as a standardisable candle. Transiting extrasolar planets provide clues into the processes of planetary formation.

    "title": "The scientific legacy of Thanu Padmanabhan",
    "body": "2021/10/11 -  Prof. Thanu Padmanabhan, one of the stalwarts of theoretical physics, and a shining star of the Indian scientific community, left his mortal abode on the 17th of September this year. With a stellar career spanning over four decades, he has been immortalized through his contributions to advancement of theoretical physics and cosmology. In this article, Dr. Karthik Rajeev brings out the essence of some of Prof. Padmanabhan’s seminal works - ranging from the formation of cosmological large scale structure to the interface of quantum mechanics and gravity.    Thanu Padmanabhan (10 March 1957- 17 September 2021) Thanu Padmanabhan, fondly known as Paddy, was an internationally acclaimed Indian theoretical physicist, whose research works are spread across a variety of topics in gravitation, quantum theory and the study of our universe. Progress in theoretical physics happens in two different, but equally important, ways. The first corresponds to significant advances achieved using existing theoretical frameworks, while the second corresponds to, what may be called `paradigm shifts’. Padmanabhan’s immense contributions to physics have been on both of these fronts. About 300 papers in refereed international journals, about 10 books and numerous other articles that he has authored, spread over about four decades of his monumental career, is a testimonial to the impact he made in the field. In 1977, a 20-year-old Padmanabhan started his research journey by investigating the interaction between gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves. The results of his mathematical study were published in the reputed journal Pramana, while he was still an undergraduate student at University College, Trivandrum. Little did his friends and colleagues know that this was only the start of a stellar career of one of the brightest and fastest thinkers of our time. We shall now briefly glance through some of his contributions in the decades that followed.  It should be mentioned that the following `summary’ does not faithfully cover all of Padmanabhan’s contributions. This article is only an attempt to explain, in simpler terms, a few of his works that have influenced the author the most. When the Quantum meets Gravity: Quantum mechanics and the general theory of relativity are two of the foundational pillars on which theoretical physics, as we understand it today, is built. While quantum mechanics offers an efficient approach to understand physics at the smallest scales, general relativity furnishes the most satisfactory theory of gravitational interaction at our disposal today. Recall that according to our current understanding, there are four fundamental interactions in nature: the strong nuclear, the weak nuclear, the electromagnetic and the gravitational interactions (see: Fundamental interaction). A thorough understanding of the first three forces is essential to describe physics at the subatomic to the molecular level. On the other hand, while studying physics at these scales, theoretical physicists often ignore even the existence of gravity and get away with it quite safely! However, the effects of quantum mechanics are quite significant at these smallest scales. Hence, any sensible theory that attempts to describe phenomena at these levels must respect the principles of quantum mechanics. Fortunately, we have a remarkable model to describe the strong nuclear, weak nuclear and electromagnetic forces that incorporate quantum theory, namely, the Standard Model of particle physics (for a recent visual description of the Standard Model, see this link). Then the question arises: What about gravity?. It turns out that quantum mechanics does not play any significant role in the gravitational interactions that, say, govern the dynamics of our Solar system. This is true even for gravitational interactions at much larger scales, say galaxies, galaxy clusters and so on. Does that mean that we should not bother incorporating quantum theory into our models of gravity? The answer is NO! The reason is that there are scenarios in nature where both the effects of quantum mechanics as well as gravitational interactions are believed to be equally significant. One such scenario occurs, for instance, when we consider physics at the very early stages of our Universe. There is a simple trick that physicists use to decide whether a physical scenario demands a quantum theory of gravity. The idea is to check whether the typical length, time and energy scales of a given physical situation is comparable to a set of constants called the Planck length, Planck time and Plack energy, respectively. The reason this works is because the aforementioned Planck quantities are defined solely in terms of the fundamental constants c (the speed of light), h (the Planck’s constant) and G (gravitational constant) (see this link for further information). Recall that Planck’s constant (h) corresponds to quantum mechanics, the speed of light ( c ) to relativity and the gravitational constant (G), of course, to gravity. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the Planck quantities (constructed with h,c and G) correspond to quantum theories with general relativistic gravity! Now, imagine the very early stages of the universe, say, just after or during the Big-Bang, when our universe was extremely `tiny’. During that era, the typical length, time and energy scales are believed to become comparable to the corresponding Planck quantities, hence signaling the need for a quantum theory of gravity to explain the physics at that time. A similar argument can also be made for the extremely dense interior of a black-hole, indicating that quantum gravity effects might be relevant there as well! Therefore, a quantum theory of gravity (translates to “a consistent model of gravitational interaction that incorporates principles of quantum mechanics”) is crucial to understand nature deeply. Unfortunately, however, one of the major challenges in theoretical physics today is to combine the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, into a coherent quantum theory for gravity. The reason gravity has not been tamed this way is primarily because it is not simply a `force’ in the conventional sense. To better understand what makes gravity different, let us briefly review how gravity is described in Einstein’s general theory of relativity (GTR). Einstein taught us that spacetime– the union of space (the ‘where’) and time (the ‘when’)– is the most natural construct to base our understanding of gravity. When there is no matter, spacetime is quite uninteresting and ‘flat’, say, like a flat rubber sheet. The presence of matter introduces non-trivial geometric features on the spacetime, somewhat analogous to how placing a heavy ball on the rubber sheet stretches it.  Gravity, it turns out, is just a manifestation of such geometric features of spacetime. The geometry, in turn, can be mathematically described by a quantity called metric tensor. Imagine the metric tensor as an object that tells us two basic pieces of information about the spacetime: ‘distances’ between two nearby points and ‘angles’ between intersecting lines in the spacetime. Einstein’s famous field equations determine the precise manner in which metric tensor behaves in the presence of matter. On the other hand, in the absence of gravity, physicists usually consider the other interactions to play out in a flat background spacetime, much like how dancers (forces and particles) perform in an inert stage (spacetime). However, the presence of gravity has the consequence that the spacetime itself is dynamic! (Imagine the stage itself performing with the dancers!) To combine quantum mechanics with a realistic theory in which the spacetime itself is dynamic is a major challenge that theoretical physicists are facing even now. In the 1980’s Padmanabhan, along with his supervisor Prof. Jayant V Narlikar, made significant progress in tackling this challenge. An ingenious idea that was the key to some of their works was to consider a simpler scenario in which the dynamic content of gravity is captured by only a ‘piece’ of the metric-tensor, called the conformal factor. Roughly speaking, what this simple scenario meant was that they considered only the distance-providing piece of the metric tensor to be dynamic while restricting the angles to be ‘fixed’ (Recall that metric-tensor gives us ‘distances’ and ‘angles’ in spacetime. ). It turns out that this piece of gravity can be combined with quantum theory in a relatively straightforward way. Therefore, they could perform several calculations that would have been difficult or even impossible in attempts towards a ‘full’ quantum theory of gravity.  Although their model might sound simple, it leads to important insights about the structure of the universe and spacetime in general, of which here we shall briefly look at only two. Before going into the insights that emerged from Padmanabhan’s and his collaborators’ studies, we have to understand certain basics of our universe’s past. There is irrefutable evidence now that our universe is expanding at an accelerated pace. What this implies is that if we imagine the evolution of our universe as a movie and play it in reverse, we would expect that the universe is contracting. Now, using the principles of general relativity and the assumption that our universe is made of reasonably realistic matter content , this thought experiment leads to the fact that the universe must have emerged from a single point in the past! Such a point is technically called a singularity and, in physics, the presence of such singularities signifies potential deficiencies of a theoretical framework. It is generally believed that a quantum theory of gravity would cure this problem. One of the important insights that emerged out of the works of Padmanabhan and Narlikar was that this belief is in fact well-founded.  For instance, one of the outcomes of their simple model was that the singularity at the beginning of our universe may be absent when quantum theory is considered! This might be viewed as a strong indication that a more complete quantum theory of gravity may also have the cure for singularity. Another result that came out of their studies was that the distance between two points in spacetime cannot be made arbitrarily small, instead, there could be a lower limit called ‘zero-point length’. This is quite counter-intuitive because our intuition is that as we bring two points closer and closer, the distance between them eventually becomes zero! The reason for the breaking of our intuition is that quantum effects potentially modify the structure of spacetime at the smallest length scales. In fact, it is found that the presence of `zero-point length’, or something resembling that concept, is a universal feature in several approaches to a quantum theory of gravity. This later motivated Padmanabhan and his collaborators to also investigate the implications of the ‘zero-point length’ in several other important contexts in theoretical physics, which eventually led to many useful physical insights. The grand design of the cosmos:  The formation of large scale structures in the universe is probably the problem requiring a solution in cosmology. — Thanu Padmanabhan At sufficiently large scales, our universe is quite homogeneous and isotropic. It is important to understand what one means by sufficiently large scale. To understand this better, let us consider a very large white sheet of paper. When looked at with naked eyes, the paper looks the same no matter at what point on the paper we are looking and which direction we are looking. But, if we zoom in using a powerful microscope, we will see that the paper is made of a network of microscopic plant fibres, which are arranged to form a uniform flat sheet at scales visible to our naked eyes. Of course, if we zoom in further, we will also find that the fibres themselves are made of cells, which in turn is made of molecules and so on. Similarly, in our universe, the stars are organized into galaxies, which in turn form galaxy groups that form galaxy clusters. These clusters are then arranged into filament-like structures, sheet-like structures and so on. Such large structures are separated by immense voids, hence creating a somewhat foamy texture to our universe, at a very large scale. Just as a paper looks homogeneous to us at scales greater than, say, a few millimetres (although it consists of intricate microscopic plant fibres), our universe is homogeneous at scales much greater than a few hundred million light-years (although, at smaller scales, it consists of several structures like galaxies, galaxy clusters, filaments etc. , at various levels). The fact that the universe is quite homogeneous at sufficiently large scales and at the same time has elaborate structures at smaller scales provides us an important clue about the state of our universe when it was much younger. Scientists believe that in the very early stages of our universe, the density of matter must have been remarkably uniform (hence, the large-scale smoothness we observe today!). However, there must also have been very small variations in this density, as we move from one place to another in the universe. The large scale structures in our universe, that we described earlier, are believed to have formed due to the gravitational field of such density fluctuations. However, the precise manner in which these `primordial’ density fluctuations led to the formation of large scale structures is still not completely understood analytically. Efficient computer simulations have been developed by several scientists and collaborations to make progress in understanding this problem. Although such simulations are helpful in making concrete predictions, they often do not provide us with clear physical insight. To gain more insight one needs a greater analytical handle. According to Padmanabhan: “This is important since some people in this field use computers the way a drunkard uses a lamppost - for support, not illumination. ” Padmanabhan contributed significantly to this direction by employing a wide range of tools in theoretical physics, which include, in particular, statistical mechanics. For instance, although the problem of cluster formation itself, in its entirety, is difficult to study analytically, Padmanabhan proposed a simple model in which one can divide the process of formation of structure into three convenient regimes. Each of these regimes was defined such that they could be independently dealt with reasonable analytical ease. He then proceeded to show how the results, in the three independent regimes, can be carefully combined to make predictions that are in good agreement with those from computer simulations. Such an approach shed more light on the underlying physics that drives the structure formation. Cosmological constant and the microstructure of spacetime: Observations show that our universe is expanding at an accelerated rate. The current accelerated expansion, in turn, seems to indicate that our universe is uniformly filled with a rather strange kind of energy called ‘Dark Energy’. Unlike other kinds of matter and energy, dark energy seems to create a sort of repulsive force at large scales, which tends to accelerate the expansion of our universe. It turns out that the effect of a uniform distribution of dark energy is mathematically equivalent to introducing a certain fundamental constant to Einstein’s field equations of general theory relativity. In this picture, dark energy is viewed as the manifestation of a new fundamental constant for our universe, called the cosmological constant. Moreover, to best explain the current observations, the cosmological constant must be a very small positive value, in a suitable unit. On the other hand, according to the principles of quantum field theory (QFT), which is another pillar of theoretical physics, the ‘vacuum’ has a certain energy content and this energy has the same effect as that of a cosmological constant. I should caution that the term ‘vacuum’ technically means the lowest energy state of a system. Moreover, due to quantum effects, the ‘vacuum’ in QFT, unlike the vacuum in the English dictionary(vacuum = a space entirely devoid of matter), has a richer structure. Consequently, the vacuum, according to QFT, must have a certain energy which is referred to as the ‘vacuum energy’. Since this vacuum energy also has an effect similar to the introduction of a cosmological constant, a certain fraction of the observed value of the cosmological constant must be the contribution from the vacuum energy. The problem, however, is that theoretically, this contribution seems to be gigantically larger than the observed value of the cosmological constant! This embarrassing disagreement between the observed value of the cosmological constant and the theoretical value of vacuum energy is referred to as the cosmological constant problem. According to Padmanabhan, to resolve the cosmological constant problem, one must start by admitting that at the deeper level, spacetime is not the fundamental object describing gravity. Spacetime and gravity, according to Padmanabhan, must emerge from more fundamental microscopic structures. This is similar to how a large number of microscopic H2O molecules interact to form the emergent fluid that we call water. He also claimed, with compelling reasons, that a deeper theory of gravity should be sensitive to only the fluctuations of the vacuum energy, instead of the vacuum energy itself. In this framework, one should identify the cosmological constant with the fluctuations of the vacuum energy, instead of the total vacuum energy itself, which we already saw was gigantically large.  This furnishes a compelling approach for resolving the cosmological constant problem, which is still being seriously explored by many researchers across the world. Note that fluids, which is an example of emergent phenomena, are described to some extent by a set of equations called the Navier-Stokes equations. Moreover, the presence of microscopic structure also implies that one can ascribe thermodynamic properties to these fluids. These thermodynamic quantities, in turn, must also satisfy certain thermodynamic identities. On the other hand, we have already seen that the dynamics of spacetime is described by Einstein’s field equations. To summarize, while emergent objects are characterized by certain kinds of features and related equations, gravity (or equivalently spacetime) is described by, what seems like, a totally different kind of equations. How does one reconcile this with the fact that spacetime (gravity) is emergent? Padmanabhan and his collaborators showed that Einstein’s general relativity itself already contains strong evidence for the claim that spacetime is emergent. For example, they showed that when Einstein’s equations are suitably reformulated, it takes the form of the Navier-Stokes equation! In addition, in a different setting, Einstein’s equations also acquire the form of thermodynamic identities! They also demonstrated that this is a feature of a larger class of theories of gravity that are extensions of Einstein’s general relativity. This, clearly, can be considered as a strong hint of the emergent nature of spacetime and hence, gravity. This raises the deeper question: If spacetime is emergent, like say water, what is its microscopic structure, analogous to how water consists of microscopic H20 molecules? In his last decade, Padmanabhan had constantly considered this question, the answer to which would revolutionize physics forever. He also believed that the difficulties with combining quantum theory with gravity primarily arise because one usually assumes spacetime as the fundamental variable to describe gravity, while it is actually only an emergent variable. The answer to the above question could also lead to the simultaneous resolution of two of the most fundamental challenges in theoretical physics: (1) formulating a quantum theory of gravity and (2) the cosmological constant problem. If experimental and theoretical confirmation of Padmanabhan’s revolutionary perspective on gravity emerges in the future, it would mark the third significant paradigm shift in our understanding of gravity, following Newton’s law of gravitation and Einstein’s general theory of relativity!

    "title": "Technical aspects of VELC onboard ADITYA-L1: India’s first solar space mission",
    "body": "2021/10/11 -  This article is the review of a journal paper on the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph, the primary payload onboard India’s first solar space mission, ADITYA-L1. The paper discusses some technical details of VELC and the work done in analyzing them. This article is an attempt to introduce the reader to the instrument, its science and the content of the paper in a simplified manner.  ADITYA-L1 is an Indian satellite with seven payloads, planned to be launched next year. This satellite will not orbit the Earth; rather, it will be at the Lagrangian 1 (L1) point. The L1 point is the location in the Sun – Earth line where their combined gravitational pull equals the centripetal force needed for a small object to move with them. This will be India’s first space mission to study the Sun. The Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) is arguably the primary payload in this mission, and the paper under discussion here deals with characterizing certain technical aspects of VELC.   Figure 1: Illustration of the ADITYA-L1 satellite with its payloads. Credits: ISRO The VELC will observe the solar corona, which is the tenuous, outermost layer of the solar atmosphere. It will analyze the coronal temperature, plasma velocity, density, etc. It will also study Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and the solar wind. CMEs are large clouds of fast-moving plasma, formed by spectacular explosions in the corona, whereas the solar wind is a continuous stream of charged particles the Sun sends out to interplanetary space. The mesmerizing aurora (also called polar lights) are caused by the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth’s magnetic field. The details of VELC: The VELC consists of a coronagraph, spectrograph, polarimetry module and detectors, aside from auxiliary optics. A coronagraph is an instrument used to observe the very dim solar corona, by blocking the bright central disk of the Sun. Coronagraphs usually have a central occulter to block the light from the solar disk; like an artificial solar eclipse. This causes only the surrounding light from the corona to pass through the coronagraph and is available for further analysis or recording. In the case of VELC, instead of a central occulter, a mirror with a circular hole at its center is used to discard the disk light and reflect only the coronal light into the instrument. In general, coronagraphs occult not just the solar disk, but some of the surrounding regions also. This is to reduce the light scattered from the edge of the occulter. Here, the disadvantage is that we won’t be able to observe and study the lower corona, adjacent to the solar disk. For example, we say that the coronagraph field-of-view (FOV) starts from 2 radii of the Sun if it occults everything within a distance of twice the solar radius from the center of the Sun. The VELC will have the smallest occulting radius among coronagraphs, with the FOV starting from 1. 05 radii of the Sun. A spectrograph is an instrument that splits polychromatic light (consisting of multiple wavelengths) into its constituent wavelengths (spectrum). This is similar to a prism splitting white light into VIBGYOR – at different angles from the face of the prism, we get different wavelengths of light. In VELC, a component called grating is used to generate the spectrum. If in a prism, refraction causes white light to split into different wavelengths, in the VELC grating, reflection, diffraction and interference together create the spectra. The presence or absence of certain wavelengths in light and their relative amplitudes can be used to find out details of the source of the light and the medium through which it travelled. Thus, the spectrum gives us details of the solar corona. Next comes the polarimetry module. Polarimetry is the technique of understanding the direction of electric and magnetic fields associated with an electromagnetic (EM) wave. We know that light is an EM wave and that the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other, and they lie in a plane (say, Plane A) perpendicular to the direction of propagation of light. But these EM fields could be oriented in infinitely many perpendicular directions in Plane A. The electric field and magnetic field could be oriented North-South and East-West respectively, or they could be oriented North-East – South-West and North-West – South-East, just to mention two examples. Light is a collection of photons and different photons could have different orientations of EM fields in Plane A as described above. The orientation of the EM fields depends on the process that creates the photon and the environment in which it is created. In general, a source of light will be an equal mix of all these different processes, with the result that the generated light will have EM fields in all directions in Plane A. We say that all directions in Plane A are equally probable for the EM field, and we call the resultant light unpolarised light. Now, if the source of photons has an asymmetry, i. e. if the processes that create a particular orientation of the EM field are in abundance, and/or if the source environment (say ambient EM fields) aides the generation of EM fields in a particular direction, then the light we observe will have an abundance of EM field oriented in that direction; now the light is said to be polarised. The magnetic field in a region affects the polarization of light generated from that region, and thus we can calculate the magnetic field by measuring the polarization. Understanding the distribution of magnetic fields is crucial to our analysis of the solar atmosphere. Thus, this is one of the ways in which measuring the polarisation of light helps us study the solar corona. For measuring polarisation, the polarimetry module contains special optics called the polarisation modulator and analyser. The detectors in VELC are CMOS-based. The detectors in normal DSLR cameras are also CMOS based, with the difference that the VELC detectors have very low noise and are adapted for use in space. When light falls on the pixels of these detectors, electrons are generated by the photoelectric effect. Higher the intensity of light, the higher the number of electrons generated. When the detector is read out, the internal circuitry will convert the electron count in each pixel to a digital count. This is how an image is generated by a CMOS detector. The path of light through VELC: The light entering the instrument from the coronagraph is split into two, based on its wavelength. This is done by a Dichroic Beam Splitter (DBS) which reflects light of a certain wavelength while transmitting other wavelengths. The reflected light (wavelength &lt; 5100 Å) goes to a section called the continuum channel while the transmitted light goes to another section called the spectral channel. In the continuum channel, a filter is used to cut down the wavelength to 5000 Å ± 5 Å (ie. green colour light). This light is then focused on a CMOS camera and the image of the corona is recorded. In the spectral channel, the light transmitted by the DBS is focused on a multi-slit before it goes to the spectrograph. The multi-slit is a unique feature of the VELC. It consists of four slits parallel to and equidistant from each other. A slit is used to restrict not the intensity of light, but the region from which the light is originating. Thus, each slit will observe only a narrow strip of the region in the corona. A multi-slit with four slits will observe four different locations in the corona simultaneously. Now, by moving either the multi-slit or the focused image on the multi-slit, we can observe different parts of the corona; this is called scanning the field-of-view (FOV), and scanning is done perpendicular to the length of the slit. Compared to a single-slit setup, four slits take only one-fourth the time to scan the same (FOV). This means the VELC can do observations four times faster than a single-slit spectrograph. After passing through the multi-slit, the light falls on the spectrograph grating, where it is split into multiple wavelengths as a function of the angle of reflection from the grating. Three wavelength bands (5303 Å: cyan - green colour, 7892 Å: red - near-infrared, 10747 Å: near-infrared) are filtered from this section and each directed to a separate CMOS detector, where the spectra of the corona at that wavelength are recorded. The 10747-channel has a polarimetry module in front of its detector. Thus we can find the polarization of light from the 10747-spectra. Overview of the paper: Ritesh Patel and their team calculated the number of photons (photon count) and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) in all three wavelength bands in the spectral channel, for different exposure times, different widths of the multi-slit, different coronal heights, temperatures, etc. To calculate the photon count, we made use of the atomic database, CHIANTI. CHIANTI inputs environmental parameters like the temperature, electron density, etc. , and instrument parameters like the instrument’s full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) (which depends on the slit-width), spectral dispersion, etc. It then gives a distribution of the photon count as a function of the wavelength. The SNR is a measure of the goodness of a signal. Whenever we make an observation, in addition to our signal, we also get noise from the surroundings. This consists of signals from other sources and the internal noise of the instrument. SNR is the ratio of the strength (power or amplitude) of our signal to the strength of the noise. For example, SNR=1 means that the signal and noise levels are the same. If SNR &lt; 1, we say that our signal is embedded in the noise. In such a condition, it will be difficult to discriminate noise from our signal. Thus, a large value of SNR is always preferred. In the case of VELC, SNR is calculated by comparing the CHIANTI photon count with the photon count from simulated instrument scatter and noise. This is done for all three wavelengths in the spectral channel. A larger slit width means more photons and higher SNR, but a smaller exposure time for our detectors, since they can only observe a certain amount of photons before getting saturated. For the VELC 10747-channel, the exposure time is fixed. So based on this exposure time, the slit-width is optimized to achieve the required photon count and SNR. The CHIANTI spectra is also transformed into a multi-slit spectral image, one for each wavelength (Figure 4 in the paper). These are how the outputs of the VELC spectral channel will look like. In this particular case, the synthetic spectra are created for CME (Coronal Mass Ejection) data from the K-Coronagraph at Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO/KCor). So, in this paper, we calculated the slit-width to optimize the observations of the VELC. We also generated the synthetic spectra for a CME. The data we got here will help in setting up observation procedures of the VELC to perfectly capture CMEs and other dynamical solar events.

    "body": "2021/10/11 -  The focus of this article is solar wind. I first take the reader through the theory &amp; observations, and various properties of solar wind. Then, I take a detour through machine and deep learning which form the basis of our work. Finally, I take the reader through our work on predicting, and investiagting sources of solar wind using deep learning.  Note: This article was originally given as a talk to the students of the Astro club of Fergusson college, Pune on 24 August 2021 . The night sky is one of the most primal sources of curiosities for many living creatures - more so for humanity. If you live in a village/town without the glaring lights and pollution, you can see the beautiful night sky dotted with stars, and possibly also the majestic Ganga of the heavens1. In the backdrop of these stars which follow regular paths in the sky lie the wanderers, who seem to move like kids in a park. Though these wanderers (or Planets, as we know them now) seem to move here and there, they also move in periodic paths that can very nearly be predicted. However, humans would see very different objects once in a while- sometimes with a tail of smoke, sometimes falling to the Earth, and sometimes as a guest star. These apparently unpredictable events would cause panic in people, and lead to associating such events with ‘good’ or ‘bad’ omens. One such class of objects which have long been observed, and feared by humans is the comets. Many thousand years have passed since, and now we know what these comets are (and hopefully given up on the superstition!). These are rocky balls covered with dust and ice which orbit the Sun in highly eccentric orbits. This means we see many of these comets extremely rarely – for instance, we can see Halley’s comet only once in 76 years2! In Fig. 1, an image of the comet Hale-Boop is shown. This image came in as an Astronomy Picture Of the Day. You will notice that by and large the comet has two general parts – a “nucleus” and a “tail”. The nucleus is the core, rocky body of the comet, while the tail is the fuzzy smoke-like stream coming out from the nucleus. As you will further notice, there are two tails for this comet. These tails are the white “dust” tail and the blue “ion” tail. If you draw a line connecting the Sun and the comet’s nucleus, the ion tail points directly away from the Sun, while the dust tail lags a bit. This observation was not missed by astronomers in the 1940s and 50s, and many sought to explain why this was the case. Then, in 1951, Ludwig Biermann proposed that while the dust tail comes due to the nucleus getting hot (so ice simply evaporates), the ion tail comes due to charged particles hitting the comet (Biermann L. , 1951).   Fig. 1: Dust and Ion Tales of Comet Hale-Bopp. Credit &amp; Copyright: John Gleason APOD 27/12/2000. This was a rather startling proposition. Remember, just a little over 50 years prior to this paper, Michelson and Morley had shown that interplanetary space is empty, with no matter. Then where would these charged particles come from? In 1958, Eugene Parker at the University of Chicago submitted a paper to The Astrophysical Journal on “Interplanetary gas and magnetic field”. He had asked the question: what happens to a star like the Sun, with a hot atmosphere3, as we move away from it? Parker had found that the atmospheric pressure pushes the atmosphere into a wind of particles, streaming across the solar system, and into the interplanetary medium. He called this the solar wind. Now, there was no shred of evidence yet for such a large scale wind (remember, Biermann had only hypothesized - science needs evidence4), and the referees5 rejected the paper while not finding any particular fault with it! But the journal’s editor was Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar - the man who had theoretically, among other things, predicted that a white dwarf can be stable only within a certain mass limit now called the Chandrasekhar limit (Venkataraman G. , 1992). Chandrasekhar found Parker’s paper to be well done mathematically, and hence overrode the referees to publish it (Arnab Rai Choudhuri, 2014; Parker, E. N. , 1958). Parker predicted quantities like velocity and pressure of the solar wind. He also performed a calculation of how the magnetic field of the Sun would look like in the solar wind. He found that the field lines would be buffeted in an Archimedian spiral, shown in Fig. 2. In 1959, the Soviet probe Luna 1 was launched with experiments to the moon. However, it performed measurements across the interplanetary space and found signatures of these high speed particles coming from the Sun. Thus, observationally, the hypothesis of the solar wind was validated! Fig 2: The “Parker Spiral”, taken from Eugene Parker’s original paper. Image source: Parker, E. N. , 1958 This caused an explosion of science on the solar wind. Then, sometime in the 1990s, the spacecraft Ulysses was launched to study the Sun from its equator to its poles. It tried to associate, on average, the source of the solar wind on the Sun. This observation is shown as the complicated Fig. 3, with an image of the Sun in the background, and the solar wind speed measurements as the lines. To read this plot, imagine that you are moving on a circle around the Sun’s image. The smaller your circle (closer to the Sun), slower is the wind – larger your circle, the faster the wind is. Ulysses found that the solar wind that comes approximately from the equator is slow - less than 500 km/s - and highly variable. The solar wind coming from the poles is much faster, peaks at around 700 km/s, and is quite steady. This observation suggested that the solar wind comes in two modalities - slow and fast.  Fig. 3: Overlay of SWOOPS solar wind speed and EIT/LASCO/Mauna Loa images of the solar corona. Image credit: ESA This opened Pandora’s box. Scientists started tackling these observations with two questions:  What are all the differences between the fast and the slow wind? Which regions in the Sun give rise to the two wind modalities? What physical processes give rise to the two wind modalities?Meanwhile, scientists found some clues on all the differences and which regions in the Sun give rise to the two modalities. First, both the winds have quite different compositions. This is an extremely technical topic for a later day, but it is enough to know that different ions are present in different proportions in the slow wind. But what about the “source regions” of the solar wind? In Fig. 4, I show the results obtained by Wang and Sheeley in 1990. They studied areas on the Sun called Coronal Holes (Wang and Sheeley, 1990) (henceforth, I call them CHs), which are seen as dark structures in the solar corona, and represent regions where magnetic field lines are open. Wang and Sheeley found that the fast wind speed showed variations similar to the CH area. So they hypothesized that the fast wind comes, at least in some measure, from CHs.    Fig 4: Solar wind speed and Coronal hole area comparison across the solar cycle. Notice that as CH area increases, the wind speed increases, and so on. Image courtesy: Wang and Sheeley, 1990.  The slow wind, on the other hand, is very tenuous. David Brooks and collaborators measured the composition of the solar corona, and attempted to narrow down on the origin of the solar wind (Brooks D. et al. , 2015). Brooks and others found that the Active Regions (ARs) boundaries show composition similar to the slow wind, and conjectured that the slow wind comes from these regions. The ARs are bright, complex structures that consist of numerous closed loops of magnetic field, holding hot plasma. However, in 2019, the Parker Solar Probe observations showed that the slow wind seems to come from CHs near the equator (Bale S. et al. , 2019). These are shown in Fig. 5. In summation, these observations showed how we could find potential sources of the solar wind by mapping the “wind properties” to “solar coronal properties”.    Fig. 5: Left: Slow wind from Active region boundaries by Brooks et al 2014. The blue image is an example of the solar corona, with the bright areas depicting the ARs. The red and green patches show the slow wind sources. Right: Equatorial Coronal hole . The region marked “Perihelion” is the location of the Parker Solar Probe, and the corresponding dark patch below is the potential source region. Image courtesy: Bale S. et al. , 2019 . Meanwhile, I and collaborators (or rather, my mentors!) were studying a slightly different problem. We were trying to develop a model that can predict what the solar wind measured near Earth, given coronal data. Since we don’t know the exact locations of the sources of different solar wind modalities, we were trying to understand how best we can circumvent this problem and automatically figure out the solar wind given an approximate source region. What inspired us? Artificial Intelligence (AI). When we started our work, we were at the cusp of rapid development and revival of machine &amp; deep learning algorithms. AI is a cool word that generally makes us think of Ultron, Jarvis, Transformers, or even the robot TARS from Interstellar. But in reality, it is a broad term for a set of algorithms that can ‘tune’ and ‘learn’ from the data. A simple example is shown in Fig. 6. What you see here is a game, like Need for Speed. Generally, a player controls the steering and throttle of the car, ensuring it stays in lane (or at least follows a trajectory). Fig. 6 is similar, except that the throttle and steering angle are adaptively ‘learned’ by an AI as we keep feeding in the car images at each instant. The core idea is similar to what is employed by self-driving cars. How cool is that? Fig. 6: A game showing the motion of a car along a road. No human is playing this game -- rather, a machine learning algorithm is predicting what the steering angle and throttle are, given each frame. Image Credits: Sergios Karagiannakos We interpreted from such development that the core idea behind such self driving car setups is to consider a time series of images, and generate a set of real values. The AI automatically figures out what the car is, where the car is, how fast it is moving, and so on. The AI does this by “predicting” the throttle and steering angle, matching the actual needed throttle and steering values, and iteratively reducing the error. Think of it as studying for an exam - you attempt to practise tests, and sure you will not get all the questions correct. But as you keep studying, you will keep learning more and more, and keep getting better and better. But what has this got to do with the Sun? We figured out that we study the Sun simply through a bunch of “images” of the Sun, while the solar wind speed is just a bunch of real values. And so, the solar wind speed prediction is pretty much complimentary to getting self-driving cars moving correctly! We then went ahead, and developed a complex AI called “WindNet”, which takes in images from the Sun and puts out the solar wind speed as a prediction. The WindNet showed pretty good performance – in fact, it was much better than the heuristically used models, and could predict 5-7 days in advance! This was a pretty cool result for a model which has no physics as input – we did not quite tell the model where the solar wind comes from! Till now people have asked what the solar wind is like, if you give an intelligently guessed region on the Sun. But our work has shown that we can ask the reverse question: with an AI which can predict the wind speed, can we ask which regions on the Sun it thinks are important for wind speed prediction? We asked an AI, trained purely on data, and not fed in with any physics, to answer a physics problem. Will it replicate known physics, or will it answer garbage? The first question we asked our model was: Where does the fast wind come from? The answer is shown in Fig. 7. The AI thinks that CHs are important for a fast wind prediction, and that too four days before prediction. This was pretty cool – we have seen that the CHs can give rise to fast wind, and the time taken to reach Earth is within the time frame of fast wind travel time! Fig. 7: The fast wind prediction, with the solar image on top, and importance map in the bottom. Blue corresponds to less important regions, while red corresponds to more important regions. Image courtesy: Author. Next, we asked our model: where does the slow wind come from? The response is shown in Fig. 8. The AI thinks that the ARs are important slow wind sources 5-7 days prior to prediction. This is in line with the observation of Brooks and collaborators. However, our AI also thinks the CHs are just a teensy bit important for the slow wind prediction. This is in line with the observation of Bale and collaborators. This was very interesting to us - AI systems have the potential to figure out the sources of the solar wind, without explicitly feeding in any physics mapping! How cool is that! Fig. 8: The slow wind prediction, with the solar image on top, and importance map in the bottom. Blue corresponds to less important regions, while red corresponds to more important regions. Image courtesy: Author. Finally, we evaluated this result statistically. That is, for all CHs, and all ARs, if one looks at this average importance, does it quite conform to known physics? Technical details apart, we found that the fast wind association to CHs was seen clearly by AI, with even the timing coming correct. However, while the slow wind showed strong relation to the ARs, the timing was quite wrong. This tells us that AI presents a potential way of studying the Sun, and the connection between Sun and Earth. However, it also needs to be perfectly trained to generate the mapping, and needs as much data as possible. This is a new era we enter, with the assimilation of AI with physics to generate models, target specific tasks, and even do good science. Let us take a giant leap forward in a quest to figure out the secrets of the Universe, aided by AI!

    "title": "Most Extreme Stars",
    "body": "2021/10/11 -  A general article exploring some of the most extreme stars of the universe. Each one of them deserves the word ‘most’ for varied reasons. Just read and enjoy the mysterious cosmos sitting at home.  Introduction: The splendor of the night sky has fascinated mankind since time immemorial. The divine beauty of the numerous twinkling stars caught the attention of the human beings since the ancient historic periods. I was also not an exception. I have loved the stars since childhood days. I watch them, observe their properties, research some of them and also like to write about them. The stars are not only for the astronomers, it is for all of us. In fact, recent advances in astronomy have proved that – “we are all Star Childs. ” Yes, it may seem unbelievable to anybody who is not aware about astronomy, but it’s true that the elements with which we all and everything around us (like the chair, table, rockets, food, all animals etc. ) are made of, were once created inside the centers of the stars. There are as many different kinds of stars, as there are stars themselves, each an individual. The nature of these stars, understanding their properties and evolution tell us the story of our own existence - the birth and death of the Sun on which we all depend. So, once in a sky observation camp at Murguma, Purulia district, West Bengal of India during the chill cold nights of November, 2007, I suddenly started thinking about the most extreme stars – the record holders in the stellar worlds! Within a year, I collected the details of more than 100 of such stars. Let us discuss about some of them today. After much hard work of about a month, I have selected 14 of them to talk. Though these are my personal favorites, I am sure some of my favorites will become yours also. Enough of introduction, now let’s dive into the bizarre worlds of the most extreme stars and try to appreciate the immense range of sparkling night sky beauties that nature has to offer. Stars of Extreme properties: 1. ADHARA: The brightest ultra violet star of the sky known till now.   Fig. 1: AdharaImage courtesy: astropixels The Northern Hemisphere constellation Canis Major is mainly appreciated for the star “Sirius” – the apparently brightest star of the night sky. But just near it twinkles another second magnitude (visual mag:- 1. 51) star – Adhara. Situated at a distance of around 425 light years it marks the western foot of the mythical ‘Great Dog’ – Canis Major. Though we may neglect Adhara, but it is about 50 times further than Sirius – and still a bright second magnitude star. It is visually about 3700 times brighter than the Sun. But when we consider the ultraviolet radiation radiated from its surface, it is about 15,000 times brighter than our Sun! The radius of Adhara is about 13 times that of the Sun. It has left the main sequence stage and started its journey towards death. Combining these properties it has gained the status to be the brightest ultraviolet star of the sky as seen from Earth. So, if we could have seen in the ultraviolet band of the EM spectrum, Adhara would have been the brightest star of the night sky – not apparently but absolutely! 2. BARNARD’S STAR: The fastest moving star of the sky known Located in the constellation Ophiuchus and at a distance of 6 light years – Barnard’s star is one of the closest stars to Earth. Its visual magnitude is 9. 5 and is too dim to be observed by naked eye.   Fig. 2: Location of Barnard's Star, ca. 2006 (south is up)Image courtesy: Wikipedia As all the stars of our galaxy go around the Milky Way galaxy on slightly different orbits, their positions change relative to each other. Such motions are extremely slow andare known as the ‘proper motion’ of stars. These motions are so slow that they are just unnoted and their positions change over a time longer than the history of the printed world. But discovered in 1916 by E. E. Barnard, Barnard’s star moves across the sky at a tremendous speed of 10 seconds of arc per year. Over an average human lifetime, it will move by two – tenths of a degree – almost half the angular diameter of the Full Moon. This may seem incredibly small to anyone reading this article. But it is a celestial record!! Barnard’s star is the fastest moving star known till date. It will leave Ophiucus for Hercules (on its way to Draco) in about the next 3300 years. When translated to a linear scale, its speed is measured as 140 kms per second – about seven times the speed of an average star. We need a modest telescope and a good star map to observe this ‘Usain Bolt’ of the starry sky. Just try to watch it once. 3. CD - 380 245: The most metal poor star known Located at a distance of about 5000 light years in the Southern Hemisphere constellation ‘Sculptor’ this star was first catalogued during the ‘Southern Hemisphere’ sky survey during 1885 to 1930 at the Cordoba Observatory in Argentina. The catalogue of these stars is known as CD. Our star’s bizarre name CD – 380 245 means that it is the 245th star within the band that lies between 380 and 390 South ‘declination’ in the ‘CD’ catalogue. CD – 380 245 is a record holder due to one of its mind-boggling property. It is the most metal poor star known! Due to its extremely low metal abundance, it becomes difficult to classify this star in a spectral classification scheme. From its spectrum, its iron content is measured to be about ten – thousandth of that of the Sun! It is also one of the oldest known stars. The Universe was created by an event called Big Bang. It is thought that the Big Bang event created only Hydrogen, Helium and very less amount of Lithium. So, the first stars (i. e. the oldest stars) that formed after Big Bang should have very less metal content. But the point is - we do not find much of these types of metal–poor stars. The question is: where are these first generation stars? Thus, we see that CD – 380 245 not only holds a record, but points to a deep mystery. It is really one of those rare, very old stars whom you can call; hello, the stellar Grandfather! 4. ESO 439 – 26: The faintest known White Dwarf When low mass (0. 8 – 2. 5 Solar mass) or intermediate mass (about &lt; 9 Solar mass) stars die, their carbon–oxygen core become exposed. These end states of low and medium mass stars are called white dwarfs – as they are very hot (so, white) and of very small size (like that of Earth) with diameter of about 10,000 kms (so, dwarf). The density of white dwarfs are extremely large – one sugar cube size mass of a white dwarf will weigh a ton! These white dwarfs are by nature very faint. Generally maximum white dwarfs are spotted in near distances (as we cannot see them at great distances due to their faintness) like the disks of our Galaxy. Their average absolute magnitude is about 16. But our star – ES0 439-269, located at a distance of about 140 light years in Hydra constellation, has an absolute magnitude of 17. 4. This makes it the faintest known white dwarf less than one hundredth the apparent brightness of Pluto! But, just wait friends…May be it is the faintest – but not the coolest. As we may expect that the faintest white dwarfs will also be the coolest ones – not true for ESO 439-26. It’s surface temperature (4560K) is warmer than the current record of 3500 K (surface temperature) for a bit brighter companionWDO 346+246 – the coolest known white dwarf. So you see, our general assumptions about nature does not always hold. 5. Gamma – 2 Velorum: A double star with the brightest known Wolf Rayet star Also called ‘Ragor’, this star is located about 840 light years away in the constellation Vela. With a visual magnitude of 1. 78 it is visually about 11,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Moreover, it is a double star. The components take 76 days to orbit each other and are completely inseparable except by means of sophisticated interferometry. Its spectrum depicts that one of the component is a Wolf Rayet (WR) star. WR stars were discovered by French astronomers Charles Wolf and Georges Rayet in the nineteenth century. The most striking property of WR stars is that they do not contain hydrogen - the main content of any other type of main sequence star! WR stars are very hot, rare, extremely luminous, and superbly blue in color. They are also losing mass madly. The type of WR star which we are concerned is a ‘WC’ star. It is one of the two kinds of WR stars. WC stars shine the spectra of helium and carbon. Our Gamma – 2 Velorum consist a WC star. Its estimated surface temperature is around 50,000 K. Though it is brilliantly luminous in the visual band of the EM spectrum, its most of the radiation is in ultraviolet spectrum. If all the radiation is combined, this WC star (a component of the double star of Gamma – 2 Velorum) is around 50,000 – 1,00,000 times more luminous than the Sun!This is the brightest WR star known till date. The WC star has lost almost 20 - 30 times the mass of Sun since its birth and till loses mass at a rate of nearly a ten – thousandth of a solar mass per year. This rate is just horrific. It is around 1 billion (100,00,00,000) times the flow in the solar wind. This wind of the WC star carries out the carbon that was created through helium fusion. The carbon enriches the nearby stellar environment from where new stars may born in distant future. Just think a bit. We can see the primary process which ultimately forms new stars, then may be planets around it and then may be life timming in one of those distant future planets. This particular star thus gives us the flavor of star formation process to be witnessed. Moreover, this star is visible through naked eye from any place south of 400N latitude in the constellation Vela during any suitable time of the year. It is designated as ‘Spectral Gem of the Southern Skies’. 6. Geminga: A weird radio-quiet Gamma Ray pulsar A massive star (9 - 25 Solar mass) dies in a violent supernova explosion leaving behind a highly magnetized, extremely dense and small (around only 15 - 20 kms diameter) core made up of completely neutrons. This dead core is called a neutron star. It spins extremely fast (many times per second). As a neutron star spins, its magnetic axis wobbles. It radiates energy along this magnetic axis which is titled to its rotational axis. If the Earth is in the way of such a magnetic axis of any neutron star, then we receive a shot of energy or ‘pulses’ from that particular neutron star. This is why; neutron stars are also called “pulsars” . The magnetic fields of pulsars are about 100 million times that of earth’s magnetic fields. The pulsars spin so fast and energetically that they radiate not only in radio waves, but also in the optical, x-ray and even in high energy gamma-ray domains. These pulses originate from the magnetic fields through the energy of rotation of the pulsars. As pulsars become older, they lose energy and also pulses from top down. The high-energy gamma ray pulses first vanish, then gradually disappear x-ray and optical and at last they are left with only radio pulses.   Fig. 3: GemingaImage courtesy: ESA But every radio astronomer got shocked in the year 1973. In 1973, an object was found in the constellation Gemini which was a bright gamma–ray source. More precise observations showed that it is pulsing at x-ray energies with a period of 0. 237 seconds (4. 2 times per second). It was named “Geminga”. Located 800 light years away, the field of the sky showed few stars when photographed. After much tenuous research, one very dim star (visual apparent magnitude 25. 5) was identified as “Geminga”. The bizarre thing is that it is a pulsar which is radiating only high energy gamma rays and x-rays, not in optical and not even in radio! Its surface temperature is between 2,00,000-3,00,000 K and the age is estimated at around 3,40,000 years. It is the first known Gamma-Ray pulsar and extremely rare in its breed. Where are the radio waves? Is it really not emitting any radio emission? Or, is there something else? The answers to all these questions is,“Nobody knows”…Just think about “Geminga” which literally means ‘not there’! 7. HD93129A: Probably the most luminous star The Southern Hemisphere sky has a spectacular constellation (other than crux the Southern Cross) to watch-Carina. It contains Eta-Carinae: the most massive confirmed star in our Galaxy. Also it has another wonder not quite visible to the naked eye (visual magnitude 7. 3):- HD93129A - possibly the most luminous star of the Galaxy. This star is the luminary of a young dense cluster known as Trumpler 14 which is situated around 9000 light years away. It is a member of a binary system. Both it and its companion (HD93129B) is O3 star. Our star HD93129A, which is a supergiant, has an absolute magnitude of -6. 7. If it was as close as the bright star Vega, it would have been far brighter than Venus. The two stars are estimated to have an orbit of at least 50,000 years.   Fig. 4: HD93129AImage courtesy: windows2universe Now look for its luminosity. With surface temperature of about 52,000 K it pours most of its radiation in the ultraviolet range. Combining all types of radiation, it is around 25, 00,000 (2. 5 million) times brighter than Sun—somewhat less than Eta Carinae. But there is a catch. It has been revealed that about 1. 7 magnitudes of its radiation are absorbed by intervening interstellar dust between it and us. If this absorption would not have absorbed HD93129A’s radiation and considering the huge uncertainties in distance, it could in fact top Eta Carinae’s luminosity. Its birth mass may have been greater than 120 solar masses. To orbit this star and receive the same radiation as we receive from the Sun on Earth, out Earth would have to be at a distance of 1600A. U away from the star i. e. 40 times the distance between Pluto and Sun. If the companion B star was not there, this hypothetical earth would take about 4800 years to complete one orbit. Just think of a severe harsh winter of 1200 years with temperature falling well below -200 degree Celsius! 8. ETA CARINAE: The most massive known confirmed star in our Galaxy   Fig. 5: Hubble Space Telescope image showing Eta Carinae and the bipolar Homunculus Nebula. Image courtesy: Wikipedia Almost 8000 light years away in the constellation Carina lays a monster of the stellar world—Eta Carinae. One of the farthest visible naked eye star (apparent magnitude 5. 0), it is around 50,00,000 times brighter than the Sun and buried in a dense cloud of its own making (the ‘Homunculus’ nebula as it is called ). It is an extremely violent star which became brighter than Vega (app. mag-1) in 1840 due to a massiveeruption. Again shining to sixth magnitude in 1890, it faded away later and recently has become visible to the naked eye. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) revealed that the Homunculus is made of two oppositely moving (speed 400 kms/second) lobes nearly a light year across. They were created in the Great Eruption of 1840. The star’s terrific luminosity suggests a present mass of around 100 solar masses making it the most massive known confirmed star in our Galaxy. Modern observations in the nebular spectral lines also suggest a 5. 6 years orbit pointing to the fact that may be Eta Carinae is a massive binary star system. Current estimates tell that the “primary” star has a mass of around 80 solar mass and the “secondary” has around 60 solar mass. The two may have been born with 200 solar mass. Recently in 2010, a star named R136a1 has been discovered in the ‘Tarantula Nebula’ of our nearby galaxy ‘Large Magellanic Cloud’. It is estimated to have a present mass of around 260-265 solar mass and is thought to have been born with about 320 solar masses! Though it is under close scrutiny till now, if the mass revealed is true then this will be surely the most massive star known till now. 9. R LEPORIS: The sky’s reddest naked eye star Have you seen the constellation Lepus (the Hare) just below Orion? Perhaps some of you know it for the blazing globular cluster M79. But leave M79, Lepus contains a record holding star in it – R Leporis or Hind’s Crimson star discovered by J. R. Hind in 1845. It is a long period variable like ‘Mira’ changing its brightness over a long 430 days period by a factor of 300 (visual magnitude 5. 5 to 11. 7). Located at a distance of about 820 light years and still to be a ‘Mira’ type variable, R Leporis must be a cool giant. Cool stars are reddish (recall Betelgeuse, Antares). It is 300 times more luminous than the Sun. But as it is a cool star, it emits mainly in the infrared region.   Fig. 6: The superb red color of R LeporisImage courtesy: NASA There are two factors which contribute to its extreme red color. First it has exceptionally low surface temperature of about 2050K, making it one of the coolest giants known. Second, R Leporis is an arch ‘carbon star’. It is now a full blown carbon star. Injecting this carbon into interstellar space R Leporis is gradually forming a planetary nebula. Carbon molecules (mainly cyanogen) absorb a huge amount of blue light. So the more amount of carbon and the cooler the star, more and more blue light is absorbed. Thus, carbon stars are very red in colour. R Leporis, due to its extremely low surface temperature takes this redness to the highest limit. It is the reddest naked eye star of the sky!!Most of the carbon in our Galaxy seems to come from stars like this one. Every one of us is made of stellar dust which was parts of such long gone stars! 10. VV CEPHEI: The largest known star About 2000 light years away, in the constellation Cepheus lays a 4. 91 visual magnitude (absolute mag – 6. 75) M2 class supergiant star VV Cephei. It can dwarf any other known star in the sky due its massive size i. e. radius. It is the largest known star considering its radius. Being a part of a binary system its companion is a hot dwarf star whose spectral class is not properly known. Having a surface temperature of around 3,300 K, this super giant primary star VV Cephei has a luminosity of around 315000 times that of the Sun. From these properties, the radius of this star derived is about 8. 0 A. U i. e. 85 percent the size of the orbit of Saturn!!   Fig. 7: Size comparison of VV Cephei A with our SunImage courtesy: StarDate As it is a part of an eclipsing binary system, its companion dwarf star hides itself every 20. 2 years behind this M supergiant. These orbital studies predict the approximate radius of the supergiant M star to be 8. 8 A. U. Even a conservative analysis yields 7. 4 A. U. This grand supergiant’s size is roughly half the size of its companion star’s orbit! Both the stars are estimated to have 20 solar masses. VV Cephei is closely followed in the size race by another supergiant (this time a single, not binary) in the same Cepheus constellation: MU Cephei (also called Herschel’s Garnet star). It is the second largest known star with a radius of about 7 A. U i. e. 40 percent larger than Jupiter’s orbit. Its visual magnitude is 4. 1 and lies just a bit south of VV Cephei. So both the largest and second largest known stars of the sky can be seen through naked eye. 11. ACHERNAR: The flattest known star   Fig. 8: Location of Achernar in Eridanus ConstellationImage courtesy: astronomytrek The constellation Eridanus starting from just below the brightest star of Orion i. e. ‘Rigel’ is a large constellation with many famous stars. It stretches through the sky towards south and ends at a bright star named Achernar- the brightest star of Eridanus. Not only this, Achernar is also the flattest star known till date! Having an apparent magnitude of 0. 5 and at a distance of 143 light years it is rotating at a tremendous speed. This caused an appreciable equatorial bulge. Across its equator it is 55% wider than across its poles. Thus, the star’s equatorial regions are less dense and cooler than the areas near the poles. This phenomenon is called ‘gravity darkening’. Being a very bright star, it is easily observable through naked eye. This makes it a very rare celestial beauty- one of the very few stars in the sky with gravity darkening effect that can be observed easily with unaided eyes.   Fig. 9: Achernar: the flattest star knownImage courtesy: astronomytrek 12. SGR 1900 + 14: Ultra –Magnetic neutron star that ionized the earth’s atmosphere Looking at the beautiful sparkling stars far away from us, please do not think that they cannot create any harm to us from such huge distances. They can really reach us and show how excessively powerful they are- and how extremely helpless and insignificant we are compared to them!One such major caution came on August 27, 1998 at 10:22 Greenwich Mean time (i. e. 15. 52 P. M. IST) from a distance of about 20,000 light years in the direction of Aquila constellation. A newly formed pulsar is so dense that it develops a solid crust that re-adjusts as its rotation rate slows. The equator is bulged out due to its fast rotation. During this readjusting phase, severe star quakes take place releasing immense energy. The bursts of this power can be unbelievable. Some of these pulsars emit relatively low energy gamma rays that last about a hundredth of a second. Such pulsars are called ‘Soft Gamma ray Repeaters’ or in short ‘SGR’. SGRs are very rare – only four have been found in our Galaxy till now. Two of them, SGR 1806-20 and our one i. e. SGR 1900 + 14 are well studied. SGRs are not only neutron stars – they are radio quiet pulsars like ‘Geminga’. SGR 1900+14 carries pulses of period 5. 16 seconds. In 1992, theoreticians suggested that some supernovae can create neutron stars with unimaginable magnetic strengths, if conditions are correct. They are called ‘magnetars’. The more powerful the magnetic field, the greater the slowing down rate of their spin. The above mentioned two SGRs are actually magnetars with magnetic fields 500 billion times that of the Earth. They carry the strongest magnetic fields of the universe!!But the story does not stop here. On August 27, 1998 at 10. 22 GMT, the magnetar SGR 1900+14 blasted an immense amount of energy towards us - 500,00,00,000 (five billion) times the energy produced by Sun per second. The intense energy radiated from this tremendous outburst immediately saturated the electronics aboard orbiting spacecrafts. Also our atmosphere got terribly affected! The ionosphere we know about is at a height of around 85 kms from Earth’s surface during night time. During day, sunlight ionizes the air and as a result the ionosphere comes to a height of around 60 kms from Earth’s surface. The outburst from SGR 1900+14 drove the ionosphere from the standard night time level to its standard day time level! SGR 1900+14 is 20,000 light years away. If it would have been 100 light years away- the earth would have been shattered within seconds!SGR 1900+14 showed the gigantic powers that stars can posses. It also taught us- “Earth is not at all a safe place from the sudden dangers of deep space. ”So you see, the twinkling stars of the sky are not only mere dots, they can reach to us and even touch us!! 13. OGLE – TR – 122B: Smallest known main sequence star whose radius is measured Come to the southern constellation Carina again. Though not visible through naked eyes, it contains another star which is a record breaker among the stellar world. It is OGLE-TR-122B – the smallest known main sequence star whose radius is measured. Being a part of a binary system, this star was spotted by a sophisticated survey called OGLE i. e. Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. It has a radius which is only about 20% larger than Jupiter – around 1, 80,000 kms only (our Sun’s radius is 7, 00,000 kms). Its radius is about only 0. 12 times the solar radii and mass about 0. 1 solar masses. Thus, the average density is about 50 times that of the sun.   Fig. 10: Size Comparison of OGLE-TR-122B with our Sun &amp; JupiterImage courtesy: newscientist OGLE-TR-122B has a mass which is close to the lowest possible mass a star can possess for starting hydrogen fusion in its core. It is truly a ‘Little Master’ of the sky, so little that it is a record holder little one. 14. Epsilon Aurigae: The most unusual variable star system known Epsilon Aurigae (ε-Aurigae) is a star in the constellation of Auriga. It is one of the most mysterious variable star known till now. Traditionally known as Almaaz, Haldus or Al Anz, it is a completely unusual eclipsing binary system which consists of a F0 class supergiant star and a companion whose proper identity is unknown till now. This star is of utter interest due to the nature of its eclipse. Every 27 years, Epsilon Aurigae’s apparent visual magnitude (i. e. brightness) starts to drop down from +2. 92, and within a period of 640-730 days (about 2 years) the magnitude drops to +3. 83. Then gradually again the brightness starts increasing due to the end of the eclipse. Also within those 2 years of eclipse process, in addition to this eclipse, the system has a low amplitude pulsation with a non consistent period of about 66 days. Epsilon Aurigae is an easily visible naked eye star of the sky. But it was the German astronomer Johann Fritsch who first suspected it to be a variable star in 1821. Later observations of Edward Heis and Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander during 1842-1848 confirmed the fact. By their observations it was revealed that ε Aurigae did not just vary over a long period (640-730 days), but also experienced short term variations in brightness as well. We know that our Moon sometimes eclipses the Sun completely (Total Solar Eclipse). This eclipse time can be up to a maximum of 7 minutes and 29 seconds. But in case of Epsilon Aurigae, the companion object which eclipses the star goes on eclipsing it for a continuous 640-730 days. Also this unknown companion does not emit as much radiation (or light) as expected for an object of such a huge size which can eclipse a supergiant star for 640-730 days! Then what this companion object can be? What is its nature and properties?This unseen, unknown companion and the mysterious eclipse pattern of the star system have made this star the most unusual, debatable variable star of the sky. The distance of this system from the Earth is also a subject of debate, but modern astronomers place it about 2000 light years from Earth. This eclipsing component is the center for all attraction today. No one knows properly the nature of the eclipsing component. It emits very negligible amount of light and thus remains invisible to the naked eye. A heated region has been discovered at the center of this object. The last eclipse of ε-Aurigae started in the International Year of Astronomy: 2009. So, AAVSO (American Association for Variable Star Observation) started a project called Citizen Sky to observe and report the data of this star system. Trained participants also analyzed data while testing their own theories. It was a three year project funded by National Science Foundation which can shed light to the mystery of the star system. The eclipse ended on May 12, 2011. Data was submitted by around 400 observers all over the world.   Fig. 11: The dimming of Epsilon Aurigae with course of time after the start of eclipseImage courtesy: Wikipedia Many probable theories and hypothesis concerning the nature of this object have come forward. But till now the mystery remains an unsolved mystery. The true nature of the eclipsing component is still a matter of debate. Conclusion: After a journey through the bizarre stellar beauties, one can understand that they are not only tiny twinkling dots in the sky- all of them have a story to tell. Next time when you look towards a clear night sky studded with all these small dots, which we call stars, just think about their amazing powers, extreme size, devastating eruptions from them, unbelievable luminosities and so on. You will surely become quiet, speechless and feel an unearthly peace in mind. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. "

    "title": "Measuring the ages of the Earth and Moon ",
    "body": "2021/10/11 -  A popular article exploring how the ages of the Earth and Moon were measured. Introduction: Scientists present their evidence in the form of a measurement. People make many statements in everyday life. Some are qualitative and some are quantitative. In science, we try to deal only with statements that can be quantified. Otherwise, we would have no way to compare results.  Scientists use measurements to arrive at precise and quantitative statements. Mathematics is the tool through which scientists study such topics like quantity. Regarded as the language of nature, mathematics has acted as the most essential weapon in almost every known field, including natural science, engineering, medicine, finance, and the social sciences. Earth’s age: the quest begins: During any cloudless night, if you go away from the city in a place free from light pollution and if you look up towards the night sky, you will be mesmerized by a spectacular sight of thousands of stars dazzling in the sky. Naturally various questions will come to your mind like: Who created this Universe? How and why did it begin? What is the fate of the Universe? Who are we? How we came from? Are we alone in this Universe? Twinkling like diamonds, the beauty of the night sky has indeed captured the imagination of human minds since prehistoric times. Curious by nature, since our first awakening, Homo sapiens or humans have been asking these questions.  This natural curiosity of humanity gave rise to science. If one looks at the long march of human understanding, one will find that science begins with the idea that we can understand our role in the universe using logic and observation. The stars and planets were mysterious objects for most of human history. Yet ancient Greek philosophers were able to use reasoned arguments and simple geometry to estimate the sizes and distances of our neighbors in space. Similarly, the most important scientific step in understanding Earth’s history was not one particular set of measurements, but rather the mental leap of realizing that Earth had a history that could be unraveled by scientific observations and measurements. This happened mostly in the 16th and 17th centuries with the Renaissance and then with a period of time called the Enlightenment. One example of how science works is humanity’s long, step-by-step search to find the age of the Earth. By studying the Earth and the Moon, scientists have been able to piece together their linked histories. In the Middle Ages, scholars thought they could calculate Earth’s age by finding out how long humans had lived on Earth. They assumed that humanity had been around almost since Earth itself formed. Therefore, scholars analyzed ancient records, especially Biblical scriptures that listed the generations since Adam and Eve. They concluded that humanity, Earth, and the whole cosmos were only a few thousand years old. The most famous calculation was made by Irish Archbishop James Ussher in 1650. Ussher deduced that the cosmos formed on Sunday, October 23, in 4004 B. C. , and that humanity was created on Friday, October 28 the same year.  Even today, some people — especially fundamentalist religious groups — still believe that the Earth is only a few thousand years old, based on this method of reasoning.   James Ussher, the person who first deduced that Earth was formed in 4004 B. C. Image credit: Wikimedia commons.  Then, gradually evidence mounted during the 19th century that the Earth was far older than previously believed. Presently we know with reasonable confidence that our planet and its only satellite, the Moon, are a double system that formed around 460 crore (i. e. 4. 6 billion) years ago.  The Moon probably originated during a gigantic collision in the late stages of planetary formation, after the Earth’s iron core formed. But, which weapon helps us to probe the age of the Earth and Moon? How can we tell the age of so confidently? Here comes the role of mathematics. Yes, mathematics equipped with brilliant minds of scientists became the invincible tool which ultimately revealed the age of our planet and its neighbour. Without mentioning the detail history of how this feat was achieved, I shall now discuss the mathematical technique which we use to measure the ages of our Earth, any rock, fossil or even any old architechtural artifacts. Radioactive decay process: The age of the Earth-Moon system and the chronology of the Earth’s history are measured using the technique of radioactive decay. This well-understood physical process also provides the energy that drives most of the Earth’s geological evolution. In the late 1800s, the crucial discovery of radioactivity made possible even more accurate estimates of the Earth’s age. The process is worth discussing in detail since it allows us to date not only Earth but also rock samples from other worlds, such as lunar rocks and meteorites. The discovery of radioactivity happened by accident. In 1896 French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel left some photographic plates in a drawer with some uranium-bearing minerals. Later he opened the drawer and found the plates fogged. Being a good scientist, he did not dismiss the event but investigated further. He found that the uranium emitted “rays,” which, like X-rays (discovered the previous year), could pass through cardboard. The new “rays” turned out to be not electromagnetic radiation, like ultraviolet light or X-rays, but rather energetic particles emitted by unstable atoms.   Alpha decay is one example type of radioactive decay, in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle, and thereby transforms (or 'decays') into an atom with a mass number 4 less and atomic number 2 less. Image credit: Wikimedia commons.  Here is how radioactivity works. A radioactive atom is an unstable atom that spontaneously changes (usually into a more stable form) by emitting one or more particles from its nucleus. The original atom thus becomes either a new element (change in the number of protons in the nucleus) or a new form of the same element, called an isotope (change in the number of neutrons in the nucleus). The original atom is called the parent isotope and the new atom is called the daughter isotope. The time required for half of the atoms of any original radioactive parent isotope to decay into daughter isotopes is called the half-life of the radioactive element. If a billion atoms of a parent isotope were present in a certain mineral specimen, a half billion would be left after one half-life, a quarter billion after the second half-life, and so on. Sometimes the result of the decay is another radioactive element, so the decay continues. But in every case, the final product of the decay (or chain of decays) is a stable element. For example, carbon-14 decays to nitrogen-14 with a halflife of only 5,570 years. Likewise, uranium-238 decays (in a series of steps) to lead-206 with a half-life of 4. 5 billion (1 billion = 100 crore) years. Radioactivity is a random process. This means that the exact time when an individual atom decays is impossible to determine. Yet the average time for half of a very large number of atoms to decay is well determined. Radioactive Half-Life: Using the general principles of radioactive decay, scientists have developed a simple equation to calculate a rock’s age. Let us examine how a scientist might use these principles to develop such an equation. Our goal is to give the age of a rock sample in terms of the number of atoms that have decayed. Suppose a radioactive isotope has a half-life of 1 million (1 million = 10 lakhs)years. A certain number of these atoms are trapped in a crystal as molten lava cools to form a rock. After 1 million years, half of them would be left. After 2 million years, half of that amount would be left. This would be ½ × ½ = ¼ of the original number. How many would be left after 3 half-lives, or 3 million years? It would half that number again, or ½ × ½ × ½ = ⅛. From the progression of half-lives, it is easy to see how to convert from this specific description to a formula for the general case. Let’s define the fraction of the atoms that are left as F. Suppose that we wait N half-lives, and ask how many atoms would be left. Based on the paragraph above, we see that the answer would be: F = N/2 To make the same equation even more useful if you have a calculator, we can take the logarithm of both sides (base 10 logarithm), which gives: log F = N log (1/2) = -0. 301 N We can check this result. From the discussion above, we know that when N = 3 half-lives, the fraction of atoms left is 1/8. Substituting N = 3, we get log F = -0. 903. A calculator confirms F = 0. 125, or 1/8. Suppose we want to determine the age of a rock crystal and its potassium atoms. A particular radioactive form of potassium decays with a half-life of 1. 25 billion years (known to 3 significant digits), yielding a certain form of argon atoms. Suppose we measure the argon and potassium in the rock crystal, and we find that 58% of the radioactive potassium has already decayed into argon, while 42% of the original radioactive potassium atoms are left in the crystal.  How old is the rock? Our measurement has told us that F is 0. 42, and so our equation gives - 0. 376 = -0. 301 N. Thus, N = 1. 25 half-lives. That would mean that the rock is 1. 62 billion years old. Ages of the Earth and Moon: Understanding the age of the Earth was more difficult than early scientists imagined. The answer couldn’t be found by counting generations of humans. The answer couldn’t be found by measuring sedimentary layers. It wasn’t until radioactive decay processes started to be understood in the 1890s that people could begin to get an accurate measure of the age of both the Earth and the Moon. How did scientists pin down the ages of the Earth and the Moon? Using radioactive dating of rocks, we can measure the time since the rock was last melted. When rocks form from molten material, parent (and forming daughter) isotopes get locked into a single location. Prior to the rock’s formation, the products of radioactive decays could escape (for instance in the mixing of liquid lava). Once the rock solidifies, decays happen in situ. By knowing the rate of decay processes, and measuring the ratio of parent and daughter isotopes, it’s possible to place constraints on the age of a rock. Armed with the technique of radioactive dating, geologists set out to find the oldest rocks on Earth. These oldest rocks are very rare because, after billions of years, most have been destroyed by the Earth’s active geology. The oldest regions of unaltered crust are in Greenland, Western Australia, and South Africa, and they are about 3. 9 to 4. 0 billion years old. In one remarkable discovery from the Jack Hills region of Western Australia, a small zircon crystal was found with a radiometric age of 4. 404 billion years. Think of it - a mineral smaller than the head of a nail that tells us about billions of years of history! We have to add to this age an uncertain number representing the time the Earth was molten and the surface was being heavily bombarded by Solar System debris. An upper bound to the age of the Earth comes from the most primitive meteorite materials, which are inclusions rich in calcium and aluminum. This measured age of the Solar System is 4. 567 billion years. The best estimate for the total age of the Earth is 4. 54 billion years with an uncertainty of only 1%.   Lunar Olivine Basalt 15555 sample collected from the Moon by the Apollo 15 mission. It was formed around 330 crore (or 3. 3 billion years ago. It is on display in the National Museum of Natural History of USA. Image credit: Wikimedia commons.  To verify this number, scientists also wanted to date lunar rocks to see if they were comparable in age to the Earth. Each Apollo mission brought back a precious cargo of lunar rocks, soil samples, and drill cores. Together with some smaller samples brought back by earlier, unmanned Soviet probes, scientists gathered several hundred kilograms of rocks from nine different lunar sites. Lunar scientists eagerly tested these samples and began to unravel the history of the Moon.  Many of the rocks were in the range of 3 to 4 billion years old, with a few chips dating back to 4. 4 or 4. 5 billion years ago. Apparently, most rocks from the first few hundred million years of the Moon’s history were pulverized and destroyed by the intense bombardment that occurred at that time, which is why the earliest rocks and chips are rare. Scientists add about 100 million years to this age for the time it took the molten Moon to solidify. The best estimate of the age of the Moon from radiometric dating is 4. 527 billion years, slightly younger than the Earth. Absolute ages from radiometric dating were used to calibrate the relative ages of different parts of the lunar surface from crater-counting methods (see related article). Radioactive datingconfirmed what the lunar cratering record indicated: the smooth dark plains, the maria, are considerably younger than the heavily cratered highlands. Once relative ages from the cratering record were calibrated, absolute ages could also be found for other planetary surfaces, such as Mercury and Mars by assuming cratering rates were consistent throughout the inner solar system. Conclusion: The methods of radiometric dating have been refined over sixty years, and dozens of different radioactive species can be used for this research. When we apply the radioactive dating technique to all sorts of Solar System samples — terrestrial rocks, lunar rocks, and meteorites from deep space — they all yield an age of approximately 4. 6 billion years. The technique is based on the well-understood physics of radioactivity, which can be tested in the laboratory.  Scientists consider this proof of the age of the Earth, and it also led to the chronology of the entire Solar System. Consider this vast number for a moment. Compared to this, all the generations of humanity are only the blink of a cosmic eye. We’ve been around for less than a tenth of one percent of the history of our planet!

Interestingly, we found a scarcity of studies in the existing literature that examine and attempt to better understand the stars in the PMS to MS transition phase. The purpose of this study is to detect such rare stars, which we named ‘transition phase’ (TP) candidates – stars evolving from the PMS to the MS phase. We identified 98 TP candidates using photometric analysis of a sample of 2167 classical Be (CBe) and 225 Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars. This identification is done by analyzing the near- and mid-infrared excess and their location in the optical colour–magnitude diagram. The TP candidates are found to possess rotational velocity and colour excess values in between CBe and HAeBe stars, which is reconfirmed by generating a set of synthetic samples using the machine learning approach.  Introduction: A clear night sky offers an ever-changing display of fascinating objects to see - the Moon, planets, stars, even a good number of star clusters and nebulae. Observing the night sky and studying it has a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. Modern science and present-day technology have certainly provided us the opportunity to view the universe in much depth, thus revealing the deep insights of different cosmic objects, which otherwise remained hidden from human eyes for centuries. We now have a pretty good understanding of the stars, their properties, and their evolution. It is known that the star formation of massive stars proceeds through well-studied, definitive stages such as the protostar and pre-main sequence phase, before reaching the main sequence. A protostar is a very young star that is still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud. The protostellar phase is the earliest one in the process of stellar evolution. For a low-mass star (i. e. that of the Sun or lower), it lasts about 500,000 years. In essence, this is the period of a star’s infancy. Next, Pre-main sequence (PMS) stars are those which are gradually attaining youth. Hydrogen fusion has not yet started in their cores, but the temperature is gradually rising. Loosely, we can say this is the child cum adolescent stage of a star. Later, when such PMS stars graduate to youth, we call them Main sequence (MS) stars. This is certainly the youth stage of stars where Hydrogen is fusing to helium in their cores, like our Sun.   Figure 1: On the left is a physico-mathematical model of the Be star Achernar, a main sequence star (Image courtesy: astronomytrek). The picture on the right captured by Atacama Large Millimeter array, is of HL Tauri, a pre-main sequence star. (Image courtesy: ESO). Pre-main sequence (PMS) stars evolve into the main sequence (MS) phase over a period of time. However, whether there exist stars that are in some transition phase between the PMS to MS stage remains an open question among astronomers. An understanding of the transition from the PMS to MS phase is vital to address the astrophysical aspects connected to disc dynamics and the rotation rate evolution of stars. Interestingly, a scarcity of studies is found in the existing literature that examines and attempts to better understand the stars in PMS to MS transition phase. This dearth of study naturally raises a few pertinent questions such as, ‘Why is such a scarcity in the studies of stars in the transition phase from PMS to MS?’ and ‘Which stellar parameter is a clear and definitive indicator to identify such candidates?’. In this context, we conducted a study in the work “Identification of emission-line stars in the transition phase from pre-main sequence to main sequence” to delve into such essential questions. Present Paper: Identification of emission-line stars in transition phase from pre-main sequence to main sequenceAim: As mentioned earlier, we found a scarcity of studies in the existing literature that examines and attempts to better understand the stars in the PMS to MS transition phase. The purpose of the present study is to detect such rare stars, which we named ‘Transition Phase’ (TP) candidates - stars evolving from the PMS to the MS phase. We identified 98 TP candidates using photometric analysis of a sample of 2167 classical Be (CBe) and 225 Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars. Both CBe and HAeBe examples of a rather uncommon class of stars known as ‘emission-line’ stars, which exhibit emission lines of several elements in their spectra. Emission-line stars: Stars usually show absorption lines in their optical spectra. However, there exist stars that also exhibit emission lines of different elements. Broadly known as ‘emission-line stars’, they belong to different categories such as T Tauri, Herbig Ae/Be, Of/ Oe/ Be/ Ae stars, Wolf Rayet (WR) stars, etc. Fig. 2 presents the representative spectra of one Be star HD 55606 showing different spectral features. A HAeBe star is an intermediate mass PMS star (between 2 and 8 times the mass of our Sun) with a gaseous disc surrounded by a dusty outer envelope (Waters &amp; Waelkens, 1998). On the other hand, a CBe star is a type of massive B-type main sequence star that is surrounded by a geometrically thin, equatorial, gaseous, decretion disc that orbits the star in Keplerian rotation (Meilland et al. , 2007). The existence of such a circumstellar, gaseous disc was first suggested by Struve (1931). One may read the article “Study of exotic Classical Be stars using optical spectroscopy” by Gourav Banerjee to know more about CBe stars and recent developments in the field of CBe star research.   Figure 2: Representative spectra of the star HD 55606 showing different spectral features in the wavelength range of 3800 – 5850 Å. Figure from Banerjee et al. (2021). The representative emission and absorption lines are indicated with arrows. Fig 3 shows the connection between absolute magnitude and spectral type of stars, which was not random but instead seemed to fall into discrete groupings, this figure is known as HR diagram or Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The enclosed regions in the illustration indicate the locations of various kinds of emission-line stars on the diagram. It is clear that emission-line stars are primarily concentrated in the region corresponding to early and late-type stars.   Figure 3: Distribution of different types of emission-line stars in the HR diagram. Figure is taken from Kogure &amp; Leung (2007). Brief summary: Some recent studies (e. g. Mathew et al. , 2008, Jamialahmadi et al. , 2015) presented convincing evidence that stars might possess an unseen and rare transition phase between PMS to MS. One reason why such stars remain unseen to date might be this: during the protostar and PMS phases, a star is usually surrounded by thick discs of dust and gas. This makes it difficult to observe such stars using ground based facilities. Mathew et al. (2008) studied 207 open clusters younger than 100 Myr and identified 152 CBe stars in 42 clusters. Interestingly, they also detected a few more stars that are situated in a region somewhere in between HAeBe and CBe stars in the near-IR color-color diagram. Fig. 4 presents the result which was observed by Mathew et al. (2008).   Figure 4: The diagram of 157 identified emission-line stars (open triangles) as found by Mathew et al. (2008). The known CBe stars (filled squares) and HBe stars (filled circles) are also shown in the figure. It is seen that a few stars are located in a region somewhere in between HBe and CBe stars. For representation purposes, the region containing the most concentration of CBe and HBe stars are marked with blue and red ellipses, respectively. The candidates which appear to fall in between these two regions are marked with a grey ellipse. This grey region constitutes stars which we termed as ‘Transition Phase' candidates. Then it was found by Jamialahmadi et al. (2015) that the star 51 Oph might be a probable example of this class of rare transition stars. According to them, ‘this star appears to be a peculiar source in an unusual transitional state’. This was the motivation for starting our ambitious research project. We analyzed a sample of 2167 CBe and 225 HAeBe stars. The main reason for selecting these two classes of stars is this: HAeBe stars are in the PMS phase, whereas CBe stars are in the MS stage. Hence, our selection helped us to detect those rare stars which are in the transition phase between HAeBe and CBe: meaning stars in between PMS and MS phase. Photometric analysis was performed on the sample of these HAeBe and CBe stars, which were obtained from the literature. Through developing machine learning and statistical technique and analysis, we were able to identify a sample of 98 stars evolving from PMS to MS phase (follow the paper for a detailed understanding of the methodology and analysis). This separate category of stars is termed as ‘Transition Phase’ (TP) candidates by the authors. They are likely to exhibit properties of both HAeBe and CBe stars. Interestingly, the detected 98 TP candidates are indeed found to possess rotational velocity in between CBe and HAeBe stars, which is reconfirmed by the machine learning approach. This provides compelling evidence that these stars might truly be passing through the rare transition phase between PMS and MS. Previous studies reported 14 among these 98 candidates to be HAeBe stars, whereas the other 84 were classified as CBe stars. We estimated the age and mass of 58 among the 98 TP candidates to be ranging within 0. 1-5 million years and 2-10. 5 times that of the Sun, respectively. However, the detailed properties of these newly identified stars are still unknown. Future Scope: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and also the largest study till date to detect and characterize TP candidates. Our study will motivate the community of emission-line star research about the significant need of detecting and studying TP candidates in more detail. Since the disc formation mechanism in CBe stars (known as the ‘Be phenomenon’) remains poorly understood after more than 150 years of CBe star research, identification and characterization of a larger number of TP candidates may shed new light on the evolutionary phases of various types of emission-line stars. We were unable to conduct a spectroscopic investigation on our samples since spectra are currently unavailable for the majority of TP candidates. As a result, we want to perform such a study for our newly identified sample of TP candidates in the future utilizing high resolution spectra. Spectroscopic investigations of TP candidates, as well as the comparison of their spectral features with that of CBe and HAeBe stars, will assist in the understanding of their disc characteristics.

    "title": "Understanding the evolution of the binary star system ‘Cen X-3’: New measurements of the spin and orbital parameters of the system ",
    "body": "2021/10/11 -  Researchers from Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, present the new measurements of the spin and orbital parameters of the binary star system ‘Cen X-3’. This work is a step forward in understanding the complex dynamics of the binary star systems and their evolution.  ‘Cen X-3’ is a binary star system observed in the constellation ‘Centaurus’. It is one of the most luminous X-ray sources in our galaxy and the first-ever X-ray pulsar to be discovered. Scientists from the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune present the new measurements of spin and orbital parameters of ‘Cen X-3’. The results are crucial in understanding the life-cycle and evolution of X-ray binary systems. The work is published in the ‘Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy on AstroSat: Five Years in Orbit’. Researchers used the data from the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters (LAXPCs) onboard Astrosat, for the analysis. Astrosat is India’s first dedicated multi-wavelength space telescope launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 2015. Cen X-3 is a two-star system consisting of a pulsar, a highly magnetized neutron star beaming X-rays, and a companion star. The neutron star is an extremely compact object; as massive as our sun but only a few kilometers across in size! The neutron star in Cen X-3 gravitationally accretes matter from its companion star. The kinetic energy of the infalling matter is converted to other forms of energy including electromagnetic radiation. The neutron star’s magnetic field dictates the accretion flow inside the magnetosphere. The accreting matter is channeled along the magnetic field lines and onto the magnetic poles forming an accretion column. The neutron star’s rotational axis is not necessarily aligned with its magnetic axis. Such misalignment gives rise to highly periodic pulsations hence the name ‘pulsars’.  Figure 1: Illustration of an accretion-powered pulsar. The magnetic axis sweeps earth in every rotation of the neutron star due to misalignment between the rotational axis and the magnetic axis giving rise to highly periodic pulsations. The image used here is available at this URL. Both stars are gravitationally bound and revolve around each other. The binary orbit can evolve due to matter exchange between the stars, mass loss from the binary system, and due to tidal interaction between the two stars. Studying the evolution of the orbit of such systems is important in understanding stellar structure and evolution. The results of these studies can be a direct test for stellar structure models and evolution theories. The first step in doing such a study is to determine the binary orbit.  Figure 2: Determination of a binary orbit from the doppler shift (NS: Neutron Star), Image courtesy: Author In systems like Cen X-3, the companion star is almost 10-15 times heavier than the neutron star. Thus the center of mass of the binary system is much closer to the center of the companion star than the neutron star. In such cases, one can visualize the binary orbit, as illustrated in figure 2 where the neutron star is orbiting around the companion star.  Due to its motion in the binary orbit, the neutron star moves back and forth along the line of sight. The observed frequency of the pulses from the neutron star is shifted due to this motion owing to the phenomenon called the ‘Doppler effect’. Due to this effect, when the neutron star is moving towards the observer, the pulses arrive faster and when the neutron star is moving away from the observer, the pulses are delayed as shown in figure 2. This results in a periodic variation with time in the observed pulse frequency. The rate of this variation corresponds to the orbital period of the system. For a perfectly circular orbit, the pulse frequency variation is sinusoidal. The deviation from the sinusoidal behavior is indicative of the eccentricity in the orbit. Eccentricity is a measure of how elongated the orbit is. The eccentricity of a perfectly circular orbit is zero. The higher the eccentricity, the more elongated the orbit. The binary orbit can be determined completely from this. For a system with a nearly circular orbit like Cen X-3, parameters that can describe the system dynamics completely are:  Neutron star spin period and its rate of change Period of the binary orbit and its rate of change Orbital velocity and radius EccentricityThe evolution of the orbit can be understood by comparing the orbital parameters at various instances of time. Parisee Shirke (IUCAA, Pune) and the team found that the spin period of the neutron star has reduced to 4. 80s from 4. 81s. This means that the neutron star is spinning up which is as per its known behavior. However, the rate at which the neutron star is spinning up has halved. This can be due to variation in the rate of matter accretion from the companion star. The orbital period was found to be around 2. 03 days. The rate of change of the orbital period was observed to be substantially large compared to the previously reported values. The authors state that this could be due to short time-scale variations in the orbital period. The orbital velocity is measured to be around 410 Km/s which agrees with the previous measurements. The projected radius of the orbit has decreased from 39. 66 lt-s to 38. 23 lt-s. This change is in accordance with the observed orbital decay in Cen X-3. The binary orbit is observed to be nearly circular with a very small eccentricity. This work is a step forward in understanding the complex dynamics of the binary star systems and their evolution.

    "title": "Understanding the solar chromosphere through spectral lines",
    "body": "2021/10/10 -  This article takes the reader through a journey of inferring the cosmos - specifically our dear neighbour Sun - through various properties of light. The journey meanders through our work on understanding solar chromospheric properties through spectral lines, and seems to cluminate in the sea of questions raised by our work!  Light is one of the most fundamental, complex and inherently mind blowing things to exist in this world. Every culture across the globe attributes (or attributed) great significance to light, while adding multiple layers of symbolism and meaning. Light has its influence right from the chloroplasts in plants converting water &amp; nutrients to sugar and Oxygen, to the largest of solar panels to generate electricity for entire cities. Light is, in some sense, our window to this world. The same is true for astronomers. Imagine an astronomer working - I am pretty sure your immediate thought is a person looking through a telescope in the night sky. Well, you are pretty correct - in that most information about the universe comes to us through light! But light is not just what we see: the radio frequency on which mobile phones operate is light, and so are the X-rays which are used to check for bone fractures. What kind of light exists depends on how it is generated in the first place. The simplest way to make light is to get objects hot. A hot iron rod glows red, while an arc welding plasma glows blue. Heat, and temperature are primary drivers of what kind of light comes out. This colour of light is given by the wavelength (or the frequency) of light. The larger this frequency of light, smaller the wavelength is, and more the energy in light. X rays have a very short wavelength (and so high energy), while Radio waves have a very long wavelength (and low energy). Similarly, red light has a larger wavelength than blue (or violet) light. So, in general, hotter objects have more energy, and hence emit more in short wavelengths, while cooler objects have lesser energy, and emit more in longer wavelengths. This is the reason why X-rays are generally much more harmful than Radio waves1. The Sun we see every day is obviously a hot object. So logically, we also expect it to give light corresponding to how hot it is. And this is quite true – the solar surface or the solar disc we see in the sky is at 5500 Kelvin. Hence, it emits most of its energy near greenish-yellow light2. But all parts of the Sun do not preferentially emit this greenish-yellow light – rather, depending on the temperature, different parts of the Sun emit in different colours. In Fig. 1 below, I have displayed the same region of the Sun as seen in different wavelengths. The hottest plasma is seen in the 94 Å image, while the coolest is seen in the 2796 Å image - with temperature (approximately) reducing with increasing wavelength. Each structure contains material at different temperatures - this is because different structures form at different heights! A general rule of thumb in the solar atmosphere is “hotter stuff forms at greater height than cooler stuff”3, so the S shaped loop in the 94 Å image forms much higher than the structure in the 2796 Å image.   Fig. 1: A solar flare as seen in different wavelengths (listed on top of each panel). Shorter wavelengths mean more energy. From 94 &Aring; to 2796 &Aring;, as temperature reduces, different structures in the solar atmosphere are clearly seen, from S shaped loops to longer loops to finally a dark sunspot-like patch from 1600 &Aring; onwards! Images assembled from AIA data (corona) and Slit-Jaw Imager (chromosphere).  This is just one aspect of the light that comes to us. The other aspect is that the material which emits this light, also leaves an imprint on “how bright” the light is at different wavelengths. This is slightly different from the Thermal radiation, which depends only on the temperature. The typical brightness at every wavelength for light coming due to an object being hot, looks somewhat like the top row in Fig. 2. Here, notice that the brightness shows some variation with wavelength (which, I remind you, is given by the colour of light) - but the essential point is that every wavelength has some amount of brightness. Now, check out the second row - corresponding to a Sodium atom. You will see that the brightness is present at discrete locations in wavelength, and most of the wavelengths have no brightness. This is in stark contrast to the thermal radiation, and is followed similarly by all other elements listed in the rows below Sodium. But note that the pattern, or location &amp; brightness of these spectral lines of different elements is unique for each element. In a sense, spectral lines can be thought of as a fingerprint of atoms and molecules. Just like each human has a unique set of fingerprints, similarly each atom or molecule has a specific set of spectral lines as its signature. These lines you see are bright in specific wavelengths, and are called emission lines.   Fig. 2: Examples of many spectrum (=spectra). On the bottom most axis, the wavelength increases from 4000 &Aring; (left) to more than 7000 &Aring; (right). The top row shows what is called a continuous spectrum, which depends only on the temperature of the object. Each subsequent row shows how much bright light is in each wavelength, for different atoms listed to the left. Image source: OpenStax . Astronomers study the spectral lines of different objects like stars, galaxies, etc, and try to figure out which all atoms, ions and molecules are present in the object of study. Remember, what I have shown in Fig. 2 is the light coming from one vertical slit - that is why, the spectral lines are all seen as vertical lines. But this need not be the case - I can also look at approximately one point on the Sun (or even average over the vertical line), for example, and get its spectrum out. This exercise will give us a result similar to Fig. 3, where we just have the brightness of light for every wavelength. This is the kind of spectrum astronomers generally analyze.   Fig. 3: The intensity of various spectral lines as a function of wavelength. Taken from CHIANTI.  A side note here: The spectrum shown Fig. 3 is the brightness (or rather the intensity) for every wavelength. We can then construct a similar spectrum for a large region of the Sun, and obtain such spectra for each point. Now, if we consider the intensity at, let’s say 2796 Å for each point, we will get an image similar to the last panel in Fig. 1. How cool is that!4 You will now have many questions: why is the spectrum of individual elements only at specific wavelengths, and not everywhere? What conditions give rise to the brightness of these lines? First off, you find the spectrum of elements at discrete wavelength locations because these arise from atomic transitions between two approximately fixed energy levels. The quantum of Quantum mechanics gives rise to this discrete nature5. Next, the spectrum itself depends on, among other parameters, 4 critical properties: the temperature of the region where the spectrum is generated, density of the material giving rise to the spectrum, velocity of this material, and turbulence6. These properties, under certain circumstances, can be easily inferred from just the spectrum of an atom. First off, note that the material which emits this light is a fluid (more precisely, plasma) in our case. Hence, the temperature and density of the plasma determine if a given spectral line will even form. So just knowing the fact that a given line is seen tells us the possible range of values temperature and quantity can take. Next, the brightness of the line is in most cases dominated by the density of plasma – more density, more brightness, but you do have the effect of atomic physics and temperature. Third, the wavelength where we expect the line brightness to peak can be shifted to different wavelengths too! This is called Doppler shift. If the plasma is moving towards us, the shift is toward shorter wavelengths (called Blueshift), and if the plasma is moving away from us, the shift is toward longer wavelengths (called Redshifts)7.  Finally, if you see in Fig. 3, the line does not immediately peak at one wavelength. Rather, it starts to increase from one wavelength, reaches a maximum, and then reduces. This is called the line width, and is determined by the temperature, and turbulence in the plasma. Turbulence basically is a measure of how much fluctuation of different spatial sizes is present in the fluid - it is yet another measure of what the plasma we consider is like. So TLDR in summary, using spectral lines, we can get an estimate of local temperature, velocity, density and turbulence of these plasma parcels through spectral lines. So what is the big idea? The big idea is that some specific regions on the Sun are thought to give rise to a stream of particles called the solar wind. We know that these regions are important, but we don’t know at what height the solar wind starts to form. Now, the solar wind is basically a stream of particles coming out of the Sun. So if you are looking “down” on the Sun, you will see that the particles are coming towards you. This means the spectral line which the particles emit will be blueshifted. So the basic idea is that we study these Doppler shifts for plasma which correspond to different wavelengths (and so different heights and temperatures, like Fig. 1), and see where the blueshifts start! Now, these regions, which are thought to give rise to the solar wind, are called Coronal holes (CHs) - because they are seen as dark patches in the solar corona. In Fig. 4b below, all dark regions belong to CHs, while the brighter regions belong to Quiet Sun8 (QS). These regions appear very different in the solar corona. However, if we check what these regions look like at lower heights called the chromosphere, the differences are reduced (see Fig. 4a)! Why so? Has this “vanishing” of difference got anything to do with the solar wind? Can we do specific studies of these regions, and figure out what causes these differences? Are they dependent on the underlying magnetic field in any way? This was our primary objective of study. At this juncture, I should tell you that scientists have done extensive studies of the CHs and QS regions in the corona, and all of the information I have presented in the last two or so paragraphs was generated in the last three decades. So we do stand on the shoulders of other giants – while we do bring our own thought process to the table!  Fig. 4: An image of the CHs and surrounding QS region in the upper chromosphere (left panel) and the corona (right panel). The green lines demarcate CHs from QS in both the figures. Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2021 . Back to our work: we studied one spectral line (yep, just one line, and you will see how much information we can infer from it!), and its properties across both the CHs and QS regions. This line forms due to a transition of the C+ ion (called CII by astrophysicists) at a wavelength of 1334 Å. How do we know the correct wavelength? We can perform controlled experiments in labs on Earth and figure it out. Now, you have already seen how there is not a great difference between CH and QS in the intensity image of Fig. 4a. Similar results hold if we look at what the plasma velocity and line width are in Fig. 5. This tells us that if I were to not tell you where the CH and QS regions are, you cannot figure them out from either the intensity, velocity, or the width of the C II line. Thus, on a gross scale, the CH and QS are very similar! Interesting things happen if we account for the underlying magnetic field. How do we do this? We ask: what is the intensity in CH and QS at similar magnetic field strengths? Similarly, what are the velocities and line widths? The underlying magnetic field strength9 might be similar, but the structure of the magnetic field can be different! The structure of magnetic field (a. k. a magnetic topology) is important, because we know that the CHs are regions where the magnetic field comes out predominantly in open lines10, while in QS the same magnetic field comes as short closed loops. These differences are seen clearly in the corona – but are they also seen in the chromosphere?  Fig. 5: Velocity (left) and line width (right) of the C II line in CH and QS. The positive velocity is called “redshift” and tells how fast plasma is moving away from us, while the negative velocity is called “blueshift”, and tells how fast plasma is moving towards us. The larger line width means the line is broader, indicating larger turbulence effects and some non trivial effects. Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2021. Turns out it is the case! We can indeed differentiate between CH and QS if we consider regions with similar magnetic field strength. In Fig. 6, the black dots correspond to the average of quantity in Y-axis (Intensity, velocity, width) for regions with similar magnetic field strength (in X-axis). On an average, you see that the QS intensity is larger than the CH intensity in Fig. 6a – reminiscent of the differences in the corona, and seen statistically here. So one question is answered: CHs and QS are already differentiated in the chromosphere, but you can see this only statistically!11 Next, look at panel (b) of the same figure. The velocity is mostly positive - indicating plasma moving away from us, and down towards the photosphere. Thus, the chromosphere is, on average, flowing downwards into the Sun. However, it is interesting to see that at 40 Gauss, a switchover occurs: for less field strength, the QS has plasma flowing down faster, while it is CH for larger field strength. This is counter intuitive – if the solar wind comes out and towards us in the CH, why is plasma moving away from us in CH? Finally, see panel (c) of the same figure. The line width is seen to increase with field strength. This tells us that the profiles are getting broader, possibly implying larger turbulence with increasing field strength. Here too, CHs are broader than QS for large field strengths!  Fig. 6: Different properties of CH (black) and QS (orange) as a function of magnetic field strength (|B|). Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2021. Things don’t stop here. The velocity panel in Fig. 6b raises many questions. And so, we repeat the analysis with a tweak - this time, we consider the blueshifts and redshifts separately. Why so? This is important to understand if the field strength has preferentially some effect on the blueshifts and redshifts, which get averaged out in Fig. 6b. And so, we check what the speeds look like in Fig. 7. In panel (a) of Fig. 7, the CHs have larger blueshifts over QS, telling us plasma is indeed preferentially moving towards us in the CHs. Thus, in principle, these blueshifts could be a signature of the solar wind. Now we are in business! In panel (b), we check what the downflows look like. It seems for regions with large field strength, plasma is flowing into the Sun faster in CHs over QS. This was the signature which confused us in Fig. 6b. Why does the CH, which is understood to be a source of particles coming out towards the Earth, have particles going into the Sun, and away from the Earth preferentially? Are we doing something wrong? Or are the spectral profiles, and thus the process which generates these lines different in CHs and QS? Turns out it is not the case. I will not show the plot here (already there is an overdose of information – too much of a good thing is also not good! :P), but we find that the spectral profiles are very similar in both CH and QS. Thus, it tells us that the processes which give rise to these profiles are similar in both the regions – the differences are coming out only because of the differences in the magnetic field topology of CHs and QS!  Fig. 7: The velocity variation with magnetic field strength, for regions with only upflows (left) and only downflows (right) for CHs (black) and QS (orange). Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2021 . Thus, through this work, we find that the CHs and QS might appear similar overall, but the differentiation in chromosphere is seen clearly if we consider regions with similar magnetic field strength. This differentiation is seen clearly as less intensity and excess line width in CHs over QS. The differentiation is clearly seen to arise primarily due to the magnetic field topology, and not due to fundamental differences in the way these lines form. However, our work poses a bunch of fundamental questions: Why is plasma flowing faster away from us in CHs over QS, when these CHs are supposed to be the sources of solar wind? Does this “redshift” bear any relation to the solar wind? How do these results tie up with analysis done for lines which form at higher temperatures (and hence, in the transition region &amp; corona), and lower temperatures (lower &amp; mid chromosphere)? And do the blueshifts we find in Fig. 7b have any relation with the solar wind? To know more, and understand what happens next, keep watching this space!

The amount of X-rays given in hospitals do not cause any harm! &#8617;        This is an exercise for you - go look up why we see the Sun more yellow than green! &#8617;        To know more on why this is the case, refer to my other article on the coronal heating problem! &#8617;        As we will see later, plasma flowing up or down will change this location! &#8617;        Check out this cool reference for more information.  &#8617;        Technically I should call it “non-thermal effect”, and it may result due to various reasons. Turbulence is supposedly one of the reasons giving rise to this effect.  &#8617;        Checkout this cool link for more info on Doppler shifts &#8617;        I have talked in detail on the Coronal holes in the solar wind article, and on Quiet Sun in the nanoflare heating article.  &#8617;        Magnetic field strength = Bx2+By2+Bz2. The individual B can be different, while the sum squared remains the same! &#8617;        When I say open, I mean that these field lines close at distances far larger than the size of our CH, on the Sun. Remember, we cannot have truly open fields since magnetic monopoles do not exist! &#8617;        Note that this question was also answered by Pradeep Kayshap et al 2018 for the Mg II line, which also forms in the chromosphere.  &#8617;    "

    "title": "Polarization of the light reflected from exoplanets: A new window into the study of exoplanets",
    "body": "2021/10/10 -  Polarization is an emerging technique in the field of exoplanets. Understanding the basic physics behind the polarization of the light observed from the planets can help us study them in detail. One such aspect is to study the polarization of the reflection from the exoplanets, which can tell us about their atmospheres, especially the clouds present in them and also, the surface features. Several big-budget missions are being planned for polarimetric observation of the exoplanets. Theoretical simulation and modeling of planetary polarization plays an important role in this regard as they help us decide the targets as well as prepare the roadmaps for those missions.  After the discovery of thousands of exoplanets, the scientists are on a desperate quest to arrive at new direct and indirect techniques to get a complete picture about the formation, dynamics and the atmospheres of the exoplanets. In that regard, polarimetric techniques have opened a new window into the study of the exoplanets by overcoming many of the limitations of the traditional techniques. Light is a wave of electric and magnetic fields. These waves oscillate at random direction perpendicular to the propagation of light. When light gets scattered by atoms, molecules or cloud particulates in the atmosphere or reflected by a surface, the waves oscillate in a particular direction. Then the light is called to be linearly polarized. An instrument called a polarimeter can measure the amount of polarization as it allows light waves oscillating only in a particular direction to pass. For example. if we watch the sky by using polarized sunglasses, we can see a change in the brightness of the sky at different directions. This is because of the fact that sunlight gets polarized due to scattering by the molecules and the dust particles in the atmosphere. Similarly, when planets reflect the light of the parent star, that light gets polarized. As a consequence, the reflected light of all the planets in the Solar system is polarized. So, we can leverage this property of light to study the reflecting exoplanets as well. Detecting light reflected from the exoplanets is difficult as the reflected light is feeble compared to the starlight itself and on top of that, only a small fraction of that reflected light is polarized. Moreover, in the case of planets that cannot be resolved from their host stars, the light from the host star contaminates the planetary light and the observable polarization in such a case can be as low as a few parts per million (10-6 order). As a result, detecting this polarization is extremely challenging. However, there are a few high-end instruments such as HIPPI, PlanetPol, POLISH, among others which are capable of detecting a polarization signal at parts per million (ppm) level. We have worked on a detailed theoretical calculation of the polarization observable from the Jupiter-like exoplanets. This will guide the existing instruments in framing observational strategies and will also help in the design of the future sophisticated instruments for detecting polarization from exoplanets. We published this work in the Astrophysical Journal (link given below). The projection of a 3D planet on sky facing us is a 2D disk (for example, the lunar disk) which is almost circular in shape. We developed a Python-based radiative transfer code (see Ref. 4) for the numerical simulation of the polarized intensity at each point on such a disk of a planet. We, then, calculated the total intensity by averaging this intensity over the disk, since we cannot resolve the planetary disk. The polarization of light from opposite hemispheres tend to be in opposite directions (see Figure 2). As a result, after disk averaging, the opposite polarizations tend to cancel out each other. This is why the disk averaged polarization from a star or a fully illuminated planet is close to zero. However, since the illuminated portion of the planetary disk varies with its phase angle (αorb; like when we see different phases of the Moon), the degree of polarization also changes. Polarization of the light reflected from a planet is maximum at half phases (αorb= 900 or αorb= 2700) and minimum at full phases (αorb= 00 i. e. when fully illuminated or αorb= 900 i. e. when fully dark). Another factor determining the degree of observable polarization is the orbital inclination (i) of the planet (angle at which we view the orbital plane of the planet; see Figure 1) i. e. whether the planetary orbit is at an edge-on view (transiting planets; i=900 ), or at a face-on view (i=00 ) or is at an intermediate angle.   Figure 1: Schematic diagram of a planet at an orbital phase αorb orbiting with an inclination angle i.   Figure 2: Intensity of the total reflected light and the polarized light (Q/I and U/I) in the visible wavelengths at different points of the partly illuminated face (orbital phase being 450) of the Exoplanet orbiting at face-on and edge-on views, two extreme cases of orbital inclination. Positive (greenish) and negative (bluish) polarizations produced at different longitudes tend to cancel out each other. The net non-zero detectable disk-averaged polarization arises because of an incomplete cancellation owing to the geometric asymmetry.   Figure 3: Predicted percentage of detectable disk-averaged polarization in the visible wavelength region and at different orbital phase angles of a cloudy exoplanet orbiting at different inclination angles. The polarization is constant with time if the planet is viewed face-on (i=00). For all other inclination angles, the polarization is maximum during the two half phases of the planet and minimum during the full phases i. e. , when the day (αorb=00) and the night (αorb=1800) sides face the observer. Unlike the traditional and popular methods such as Transit Photometry and Radial Velocity methods which can detect planets only if they are viewed almost edge-on, polarimetric method can detect and probe exoplanets orbiting with a broad range of orbital inclination angles. Hence, we can use this technique to detect exoplanets in future. Moreover, polarimetric studies can complement the other studies providing us with deeper insights into the structure of the atmospheres, especially about the clouds and hazes in the atmospheres as well as the surface features (for rocky planets) of the exoplanets. Using this powerful technique, we will be able to even detect liquid water on the surface of the exo-Earths in the future!

    "title": "Using GitHub for Academic Research",
    "body": "2021/10/09 -  GitHub has become the go-to tool for software engineers across the world to keep their codes together and collaborate with each other. Being easy, seamless, and available on all the platforms makes it a brilliant choice indeed.  I am involved in academic research for quite some time now and can find some pretty good uses for this platform. Of course, GitHub was designed to keep the codes together and collaborate and this is the backbone of research too, which is why I find GitHub quite appealing. There are obvious benefits of using GitHub:  Keeping all the codes and data files together offline as well as a backup on the GitHub servers.  Version control for all the files.  Collaborating on projects together.  Managing the research projects and keeping track of the issues.  Free hosting for websites. For beginners, it is helpful to go through the basic documentation about GitHub. For example a YouTube video introducing GitHub is available below: Besides the GitHub website itself, there are plenty of other websites and tutorials available on the web. I am including a few bare essentials that one needs to go through in order to understand what GitHub is:  Creating a git repository Cloning a git repository A tutorial for git usage Guide to git version control Introduction to Branches GitHub Project Boards Github pagesThe idea of having a single repository (in git terminology folder is repository) for a project helps a lot in reducing confusion and saves a lot of time. It indeed is a good habit. Making that repository a git repository and putting it on GitHub is an even better habit. People working with Jupyter notebooks may find GitHub extremely helpful, especially in terms of executing the notebooks in the clouds. nbviewer can load the notebooks directly from the git repository which can then be executed directly on binder. Even Google colab allows the import of notebooks from GitHub directly to be executed there. HackMD, a Markdown editor allows the files to be pushed to and pulled from GitHub. In astronomy, most of the code is often open-source and available to the community. Some researchers provide links to their codes hosted on GitHub which becomes easier to obtain and raise any issues. The point is that the familiarity with GitHub is advantageous. People sometimes present their entire work, including the codes, plots, and related text files on GitHub as a repository which indeed serves as a welcome step towards reproducible research. Now, my personal bent towards git is motivated by the reproducibility of research. In the world of academic research reproducibility has often been cited as a problem (see this BBC report or Nature article). Reproducibility should be the backbone of research as scientific findings work on this principle. Maintaining a git project should help in establishing this easily. One may put the link to the entire working repository once their findings are published so that anyone willing to re-do the analysis does that seamlessly. People have even proposed a GitHub type of social network for academic research. I have tried to implement GitHub for all my research projects, and the workflow has only gone smoother with time. The project management becomes easy, versions are easy to track and overall the repository structure becomes more transparent with time. I don’t waste time looking for individual files anymore, as they have been neatly arranged in the respective places. With a backup on the GitHub cloud server, it becomes easy to access any item from any device. Working on multiple devices too becomes easy as I can run multiple items in parallel and then push to the respective branches and merge them subsequently. Moreover, the project boards are a neat way to organize all the work. We can have work in progress, work to be done, and work that has been completed arranged in the form of cards. We may open an issue from these cards themselves. Github pages are also one of the noticeable features of Github as it lets one host personal webpages on GitHub, which again I feel is well suited for us. The static website can be put up easily using Jekyll. The academic pages template is used by thousands of researchers and scientists around the world to keep their content together on a static web page. My personal website is hosted on GitHub too. Pushing things on the website is as easy as typing up a markdown or HTML file and pushing it onto GitHub. GitHub as a service provides us with an option to manage our workflow in an eficient way, without worrying about versions of documents and provides seamless collaboration features. I hope with this article I have provided some useful insight into this service. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. "

    "title": "How strong is a neutron star's magnetic field? <br> ",
    "body": "2021/10/09 - Estimating the strength of the magnetic field of a neutron star in a binary star system ‘Cen X-3’:  Researchers from Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bangalore, report the detection of cyclotron resonant absorption feature (CRSF) in the X-ray spectrum of the binary star system ‘Cen X-3’. The magnetic field of the neutron star in Cen X-3 is estimated from the CRSF. This work is a step forward in understanding the nature of humongous magnetic fields of Neutron Stars.  Researchers from Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bangalore, report interesting findings about the binary star system ‘Cen X-3’ from the constellation ‘Centaurus’, one of the most luminous X-ray sources in our galaxy and the first-ever X-ray pulsar to be discovered. Their findings published in the Monthly Notices of Royal Astronomical Society, uses data from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) of NASA and Suzaku, an X-ray satellite operated by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.  Cen X-3 is a two-star system consisting of a pulsar - a highly magnetized neutron star beaming X-rays - and a companion star. The magnetic field of a neutron star in Cen X-3 is estimated in this work. The findings also provide insights into understanding the nature of humongous magnetic fields of Neutron Stars. Imagine a star as massive as our Sun but only a few kilometers across in size: that’s a neutron star! It is so dense that the mass of the entire living human population could fit into a sugar cube-sized neutron star matter. In other words, it is like an entire Mount Everest squeezed to fit inside a coffee cup. Owing to their extreme density, the gravitational field of a neutron star is the strongest except for black holes. In fact, if they were any denser, they would become black holes themselves. Neutron stars have some pretty bizarre properties. Their gravity is strong enough to bend light. They are extremely hot, with a surface temperature of nearly a million degrees Celsius. Even stars hate to be alone! The majority of the neutron stars like the one in Cen X-3 are a part of a binary star system with the main sequence or post main sequence star as a companion. The neutron star gravitationally accretes matter from its companion star. The accretion disk is formed around the neutron star when the angular momentum of the accreted matter is too large for the direct impact onto the neutron star surface.   Figure 1: Inside the magnetosphere, the accreting matter is channeled along the magnetic field lines and onto the magnetic poles forming an accretion column. Image used here is available at this URL. Accretion of matter onto a compact object such as a neutron star or black hole is one of the most efficient ways known for extracting energy from matter. The denser the object, the higher is the efficiency! Part of this energy is emitted in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The magnetic field of a neutron star is almost a trillion times greater than that of the Earth. Such a high magnetic field dictates the accretion flow inside the magnetosphere. The accreting matter is channeled along the magnetic field lines and onto the magnetic poles forming an accretion column. The neutron star’s rotational axis is not necessarily aligned with its magnetic axis. Such misalignment gives rise to highly periodic pulsations hence the name ‘pulsars’.   Figure 2: Illustration of an accretion-powered pulsar. The magnetic axis sweeps earth in every rotation of the neutron star due to misalignment between the rotational axis and the magnetic axis giving rise to highly periodic pulsations. The image used here is available at this URL. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, all particles show wave-like characteristics. The wavelength associated with the particle is called the de Broglie wavelength (λ de Broglie = Planck’s constant/momentum). The length scales that we deal with in day-to-day life are much larger than the de Broglie wavelength of the particles. The wave nature of the particles and associated quantum mechanical phenomenon becomes apparent only when the length scale of the system is comparable to its de Broglie wavelength.   Figure 3: Landau quantization and resonant scatteringImage courtesy: Ashwin Devaraj (IISc-JAP) In the presence of a magnetic field, the charged particles in the accretion column rotate around the magnetic field lines in a helical trajectory. Larger the magnetic field, the smaller the radius of gyration. The orbits and corresponding energies are quantized due to a phenomenon called landau quantization; however, its effect becomes significant only in the presence of an extremely strong magnetic field where the radius of the gyration of the infalling particle is of the order of its de Broglie wavelength. The photons generated during the accretion undergo scattering with the relativistically infalling matter in the accretion column. Due to resonance, the likelihood of scattering i. e. the scattering cross-section is maximum at the quantized Landau energy levels resulting in the absorption-like feature at those energies in the X-ray spectrum (energy distribution of the incident light). This feature is called a cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF). Figure 3 illustrates the quantization of the orbits and the resonant scattering of photons. Gunjan Tomar (RRI, Bangalore) and the team studied CRSF originated due to the scattering of photons with electrons in the X-ray spectrum of Cen X-3. The energy of the CRSF is directly related to the strength of the magnetic field. It is the only direct way to measure a neutron star’s magnetic field strength. The energy of the electron CRSF feature was observed to be around 30 KeV. The neutron star magnetic field can be estimated to be around 2. 6 x 1012 Gauss from this. The strength of the magnetic field of the neutron star increases steeply as one approaches the stellar surface. The CRSF energy is related to the magnetic field strength and thus depends on where the CRSF originates. The matter accretion rate which is directly related to the source luminosity is thought to affect the location of the origin of the CRSF feature. The relation between the CRSF energy and the source luminosity would strengthen the above argument. However, researchers could not find any such relation. This research is a step forward in understanding the gigantic magnetic field of a neutron star and its role in the accretion of matter.

    "title": "What is CosmicVarta?",
    "body": "2021/10/06 -  CosmicVarta is a team effort where we all come together to discuss astronomy and related tools and ideas. Come join us on this journey!  Astronomy is truly a global subject. The boundaries between nations, people and ethnicities do not exist for astronomers. Astronomers and astrophysicists strive to study the cosmos in the hope of understanding and realizing our place in the Universe. Thus it is the responsibility of astronomers to convey what is found in our studies to the general public. Many news platforms and science popularization websites do a wonderful job of letting the public know about the final results from a few studies that are carried out in certain reputed astronomy institutes. But a vast majority of exciting research that is done in many universities and institutes throughout India never come outside of the scientific community. Professional astronomers give a detailed description of all their studies including how it was conducted and how they came to conclusions about astronomical objects from their studies in peer-reviewed scientific journals. But these articles are written in a highly scientific language and it is full of jargon. This makes the content incomprehensible to not only the interested reader but also to novice students who are not dealing with the subject on a day-to-day basis. But we want every interested individual to have a glimpse of the exciting life of astronomers. To do so we have started this platform to connect all astronomers and astrophysicists in India with the general public. Here, researchers will explain the work that goes on in their laboratories or in their research area (not just the results but how the conclusion was reached, what happens with all the data that is obtained from satellites and telescopes, why do we build bigger and better instruments et cetera) in a non-technical language. While we can make videos and explain what we do, we need to acknowledge that not everyone is comfortable in front of the camera, but what every PhD student/researcher is comfortable with is writing. Thus, through CosmicVarta, we intend to present the content published in scientific journals in a simplified yet detailed way so that people from every background can grasp the essence of the results. Articles on CosmicVarta can even help students understand the concept in a non-technical way before they go on to read the original article published in scientific journals. We also plan on publishing interviews with eminent professors and scientists as well as students working in the field of astronomy and astrophysics all over India. Thus prospective students can use this platform to find guidance and understand what to expect when entering this field. Apart from positions in astronomy and astrophysics in prominent research institutions, research in astronomy in India is carried out in various state, central and deemed universities as well. Through this portal, prospective students may also find information regarding them. This platform will also serve as an information hub regarding various software and databases that are available to be used by the public for free. The idea of CosmicVarta was found to be interesting by a wide variety of people we discussed with which indeed is very encouraging. We want to thank all the researchers who have contributed to the website by writing about their own papers or papers in their field before we even went live! We request all our readers to connect with us and even share their ideas for improving the platform. We also request all researchers involved in astronomy and astrophysics in India to write about their work and contribute towards popularizing astronomical research. Finally, and most importantly, just join us on a journey that will take you to the wonderful world of stars, galaxies, and beyond; and feel enthralled by the unlocking of the keys to the mysteries of the universe which scientists are doing on a daily basis.

    "title": "Mendeley Reference Manager",
    "body": "2021/10/04 -  Being involved in research means dealing with a lot of papers on a day to day basis. Be it reading them, organizing them, or referencing them we often face a perilous task. A collection of scores of pdf documents scattered here and there in multiple folders is not something unheard of. Often we spend a lot of time looking for a particular part of the text from a paper but unable to locate it. While writing papers, and searching for references I’ve seen a lot of people doing it manually which is a waste of precious research time.  Thanks to the advances in software in the past years, we have a tool which can do it all for us, saving a lot of time and energy as well. It is ‘MENDELEY’ offered by Elsevier.  Mendeley is a library manager which can store and arrange all the pdf documents we put into it. A very informative guide is available on the official website. ​My first interaction with Mendeley was when I was doing research work related to my dissertation as a part of the M Sc. course. The scholars in that lab were pretty much using Mendeley on a day-to-day basis and from there I picked up the idea of organizing papers nicely into a library interface. It is a versatile software available for almost all desktop and mobile systems. As we use Debian based Linux for our research, there is a . deb package available on the website. There is an app on the android app store as well which can be pretty helpful in organizing the research papers. The Mendeley website offers a web library interface that is not very different from the one we have on the desktop. Apart from that, browser extensions are available for both Chrome and Firefox browsers which can be used to save the articles we open in the browser to be directly saved to the web library. In fact, the experience is extremely seamless, one can read a document on her laptop and highlight some text and can continue with the same point at her desktop at a later time. No need to waste time searching for that one particular paragraph from scores of papers put in unlimited folders. The sync works perfectly fine across all devices. One can also assign a folder in which Mendeley will automatically look for papers once the application starts. Of course, everything syncs to the web library eventually. One has to create a single Mendeley account for all the devices preferably over the website and then use the same login credentials for every device. After that the installation is pretty simple, just follow the steps in a logical fashion and within a few seconds, you’ll have your own library waiting for the papers to put it. Then there are a few ways in which the papers could be added:  Using the Chrome and Firefox browser extensions, just click on save once you come across a paper, and it’ll be dropped into your library.  Add a watch folder, and Mendeley will automatically look for files in that folder.  Add files/folders manually using a point and click interface. The documents will then be uploaded to your Mendeley account online. So once the library is set up and we have a collection of papers, the first thing to notice is that it can automatically sort and arrange the papers based on author name, title, publication year, journal name, etc. For incomplete references, Mendeley offers to search the database using the arXiv IDs or DOIs which maybe available in the document metadata. All the files are stored locally as well as synced with the cloud library. One can also create groups to keep the papers more organized. A pdf reader is built in the Mendeley package. It is a versatile pdf reader with annotation capabilities. One can mark, highlight, add comments at any point in the document. Besides the library offers a fully searchable interface meaning one can look for the exact phrase or line in a collection of 1000 papers! Imagine doing that manually. Although the basic edition is free to use, there is a limitation of 2GB storage per account. The pricing is pretty simple 5GB will cost you approximately $55/year and $165/year for unlimited storage. For me, the free edition suffices the need for now. Let’s see what happens in the future. Ever since I installed this application on my desktop, I guess I have saved a lot of time. There is no need to look for papers through my file explorer or terminal. If I have to search for a particular text snippet, I just put that in my Mendeley search bar and it searches for the same in all the papers and of course, it makes life easy. Apart from that, the inbuild BibTeX means I don’t need to run here and there for references for my texts as Mendeley can easily export all the references in BibTeX format. If I come across a nice paper, or during the arXiv search something catches my attention, it goes straight to my library within a few seconds using the Chrome extension. While writing drafts, the automatically exported . bib file is hassle-free for the bibliography. Some web links including tutorials for Mendeley are listed below:  https://www. mendeley. com/guides https://alliant. libguides. com/c. php?g=692700&amp;p=4908245 https://guides. lib. berkeley. edu/mendeley/libraryPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

    "title": "Using machine learning to infer Solar coronal heating",
    "body": "2021/09/29 -  This article traces the origins of the coronal heating problem, and describes in vivid detail our efforts in resolving this through machine learning. This is a non-technical article based on our paper, but references have been appended for the interested reader!  The Sun is a spectacular celestial object that has captivated humanity for long and holds many unresolved secrets. It is a huge ball of gas, mainly made of hydrogen, but containing many other elements like Sodium, Calcium, Magnesium, Iron, etc. Generally, the Sun is seen as a disc in the sky. This disc of the Sun is known as photosphere, or the surface of the Sun. However, during a total solar eclipse when the Sun is hidden by the moon, streams of gas may be seen extending outwards from the photosphere as shown below. This faint region of the solar atmosphere is called the Solar corona.   Fig. 1: Image of the extended solar corona taken during an eclipse. Image source: Nicolas Lefaudeux . Since the 1900s, astronomers have been studying the Sun and various stars through the spectrum of these stars. The spectrum of any star is basically the amount of light emitted at different wavelengths. Light as we know can be (for our purposes!) thought of as a wave1, with the wavelength telling us, in some sense, how long each wave is. Stars produce light of various wavelengths, which is mainly controlled by its temperature at the photosphere. However, different elements in the atmosphere of stars can also give rise to bumps or dips in this spectrum, depending on how many electrons each element has. The number of electrons however depends on how hot the particular atom or ion is. Generally, the hotter an ion is, the fewer electrons it has. Hence, such bumps can be used to measure the temperature at various locations (and not just at the photosphere!) in the atmosphere of stars. This was the seminal contribution of Meghnad Saha and Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin2. Early on, astronomers analyzed the photosphere of the Sun, and found it to be at approximately 5500 K. In the 1940s, astronomers then took to analyzing the spectrum of the solar corona. Now, common sense tells us that as one moves away from a hot object, the temperature must reduce. Hence, we expect the solar corona to be at a lower temperature than the photosphere. However, astronomers found that as one moves from the photosphere into the solar atmosphere, the temperature initially drops and then starts rising to more than a million degrees Kelvin in the corona (Bengt Edlen. , 1945, P. Swings. , 1945)! The corona was found to be so hot, that elements like Iron, which generally have 26 electrons in their atoms, had lost more than 13 electrons! How does this occur? This has been a long-standing puzzle with a deceptively simple answer. The simple answer is: common sense is correct. Only if one moves away from a hot object will one expect the temperature to fall. It would not be the case if, for some reason, heat is generated in the solar corona. This heat source keeps the corona hot and at a million degrees Kelvin. Then the question arises: What is this source of heat? A simple guess can be made by looking at the Sun at the photosphere and in the corona. The picture below is taken from a suite of instruments called Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)[Paul Boerner et al. , 2012] &amp; Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)[P. H. Scherrer et al. , 2011] on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). SDO is a NASA satellite which observes the Sun predominantly in the photosphere and the corona. Think of it as an extremely complex camera (which it literally is!), taking pictures across different temperatures for scientists to study. The left image shows the map of the Magnetic field along the line of sight across the photosphere, with black and white representing negative and positive magnetic field polarities respectively. The grey areas have very weak magnetic fields, while the field is stronger if the color is blacker or whiter. On the right, we have the corresponding image of the corona, taken from AIA. Compare these two images carefully: it seems that the black/white areas from the magnetic field are located in the same regions as the bright areas in the corona. Hence it seems that the corona is brighter for regions with a stronger magnetic field. Might this be related to the corona’s temperature?  Fig. 2: On the left, we have the magnetic field on the Sun’s photosphere, taken through HMI. On the right, we have an image of the solar corona, taken through AIA. Image source: NASA/SDO HMI &amp; AIA . It was realized early on that the magnetic field of the Sun contains a lot of energy. This energy can, in principle, be used up to heat the corona. We now ask deeper questions: How does this occur? And how do we know this energy is enough to heat the corona? One of the more popular mechanisms of converting magnetic energy to heat is through impulsive events (Parker, E. N. , 1988). Impulsive events are basically bursts of energy, where magnetic energy is dissipated as heat. The impulsive events, which convert magnetic to heat energy, are known to occur at a variety of length and time scales. These could be large or small and may last for hours or minutes, depending on how much energy was released. The large versions of these events, which release tremendous amounts of energy, are well known as solar flares. Many studies have been done on these large flares or on smaller events called microflares. The microflares, as the name suggests, have a million times less energy than the large flares. However, they are much more frequent in the corona. The hypothesis by Parker, E. N. , 1988, and further expansion by Hudson. H. S. , 1991; is that such impulsive events are much more frequent if they have low energy, and a combination of such events may maintain the coronal temperature. This is called the nanoflare hypothesis. It essentially translates to the hypothesis that one first needs to count the number of events that occur at each energy scale. Then, suppose one finds the total heat dissipated due to all such events at each energy to be larger for smaller events. In that case, impulsive heating is enough to maintain the solar corona’s temperature. Studies generally attempt to count how many events occur at given energy and get a sense of how much energy is released in such events. Then, they compare if these energies are enough to maintain the corona at a million-degree Kelvin or not. Such statistics, however, are ridden with a grave fallacy: If individual events can be seen, we can count them. What if we cannot even see these individual events? What if all we see is a combination of a multitude of such events? This question has plagued solar physicists for a long time. A possible answer to this question lies in what in the corona do we see. Studies are generally targeted towards the large, bright, and beautiful structures called Active Regions. In Fig. 3, a picture of the solar corona is seen. Immediately, we can see that there is a bright region near the center, and this is called an Active Region. These active regions contain a large amount of magnetic energy which can be converted to heat. However, there are other regions in the corona where there are no beautiful large structures. These structures are known as Quiet regions.  Approximately every 11 years, the Sun is seen to wake up, become violent, and then go to sleep. This is known as the solar cycle. The active regions are predominantly seen when the Sun is active (the violence comes from active regions, mostly!). The solar corona, on the other hand, is hot even when the Sun is quiet and sleeping! This means we must study this quiet time to figure out coronal heating!  Fig. 3: The solar corona as seen from the 211 A passband of AIA shows two distinct structures here. One kind of structure is the bright Active Regions, and the other is the background calm Quiet Sun. Image source: Solar Dynamics Observatory . In our work, we addressed (or rather, incorporated) both of these characteristics to provide constraints on the viability of these impulsive events. First off, we took only the Quiet Sun data. All other large, dynamic events were left out. Second, we used a statistical impulsive heating model (A. Pauluhn et al. , 2006) to infer heating signatures. But how? Enter Deep learning. Deep learning is a set of techniques (generally referring to neural networks) used to perform inferences on big data. These neural networks can “learn” the data given to them and perform any assigned task. When you check for translation of words on Google, it basically deploys deep learning in the background. The neural network used for such language-to-language translations has been trained on many statements and correspondences between two languages. Hence, when you ask it to translate words (or even sentences), it can translate pretty much very well! For our work, we took the statistical impulsive heating model and made a large number of simulations. The impulsive heating model generates a time series of intensity (called light curves), given some free parameters. These simulations statistically would represent the light curves of the Quiet corona. However, there are no objective techniques to compare these simulations with observations in a statistically robust manner. Hence, we trained our deep learning model on mapping the light curves back to the free parameters. This is called learning an inversion code. The inversion code takes in the light curves, analyzes them in a highly complicated non-linear way, and gives out the best parameter set representing the light curve. The inversion code is checked on a testing set of simulations. Think of this whole procedure as attending a class (=training) and writing an exam (=testing). Since you typically do not know what questions will be asked in an exam, the testing set contains simulations that were not used for training. Hence, the performance of the inversion code is checked and validated in this way. Once this inversion code is checked, we apply it on approx. 3,00,000 light curves from the Sun to infer the free parameters. In this way, we circumvent the problem of not seeing individual events in the Quiet Sun – we can infer their statistical signatures! This scheme is explained below:  Fig. 4: A summary of our procedure. The simulated light curves are mapped to their parameters by training a deep learning model, which in our case is a Convolutional Neural Network. Then, these parameters can be inferred by feeding in the observed light curves in the model. So what do we get from applying this elaborate scheme? We find the impulsive events occur at a frequency of around 2 events per minute. Each event lasts approximately 10-20 mins. Overall, we find smaller events to dominate over larger events, which seems to confirm the hypothesis of impulsive heating of the corona. Then, we studied various properties of these heating events. First, we found that events can be either large and occur rarely, or be very small and occur frequently. This means that there exists a well of energy, that can be emptied by occasional large buckets or very frequent small buckets. Second, we found that larger events die down much faster than smaller events. This counterintuitive result seems to arrive as a result of what is called thermal conduction. Thermal conduction is the reason why, if you leave the ladle for too long in the kadai, it gets very hot. Heat travels through metal efficiently, and makes it hotter. Hotter the kadai3, the faster the ladle gets hotter. Similar phenomenon occurs in the corona, but here the ladle is the magnetic field lines, and the kadai is the impulsive event. The thermal conduction along magnetic field lines is very efficient, so the more the energy, the faster it is transmitted. We find signatures of this thermal conduction through our analysis. Finally, we find excellent correspondence between the properties of these small-scale events and large-scale events like solar flares. It almost seems like the small events we find are like younger siblings of the large-scale flares. And through a marriage of deep learning with solar physics knowledge, we can impose constraints on the heating of the solar corona!
