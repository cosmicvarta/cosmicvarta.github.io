    "body": " Light when seen correctly provides rich information on what happens in the cosmos. In this article, we showcase our work on identifying signatures of the solar wind in the solar chromosphere – far lower in the solar atmosphere than what has been expected. We take the reader through our analysis, interpretations and speculations on our observations, and present a unified model of solar wind emergence and the heating of quiet corona. NOTE: This article is a follow-up to Understanding the solar chromosphere through spectral lines (which I shall henceforth call A1) written by yours truly. While I have presented a summary of the previous article here too, possibly you would enjoy reading them together better! Light, as we have seen in #A1, encodes in it information regarding the world. It is especially of great help to astronomers in figuring out what-where-why something happens. For those of us folks who study the Sun, we are bathed – or rather, burnt crisp with light. And so, light or photons carry with them information regarding various aspects of different regions on the Sun. Now, we have seen in #A1 that each element or ion has a characteristic fingerprint in the form of “spectral lines”. The properties of these spectral lines depend on the plasma properties where the particular ion is present. Critically, it depends on the local temperature, density, velocity, and any other turbulent flows present in the plasma. These show up as effects on the line intensity, the line “shift” and the line width. And so by “reading out” these spectral lines, we can get an estimate of how much plasma is present, how fast it is moving, and in what direction it is moving – at the very least!. The solar atmosphere is composed of the photosphere (at ~5500 K), the chromosphere (at ~10,000 to 80,000 K), Transition region (TR; ~1,00,000 K) and the corona (&gt;10,00,000 K). The rise in temperature with the height of the atmosphere is the rather much-debated “Coronal heating problem”, which presents more questions than answers1. The corona then extends outwards as the streaming solar wind, with plasma moving at great speeds outwards from the Sun2. The exact reason(s) behind the large temperature of the corona, and the height (or the layer of the atmosphere) from where the solar wind starts are not known well, and are an unsolved problem in solar physics. In #A1, we attempted to understand the underlying cause of these two problems in tandem by studying two regions called the Coronal Holes (CHs) and Quiet Sun (QS). The CHs are regions seen as dark in the corona against the background QS - see Fig. 1, first panel. "

    "body": " What is CosmicVarta?Astronomy is truly a global subject. The boundaries between the nations, people, ethnicities do not exist for astronomers. We all think of the entire humankind as one. Hence, it becomes necessary and a responsibility for professional astronomers to present a platform where the authentic research being carried out is presented and discussed in language which a non-expert individual can understand. Moreover, while high quality research is communicated through the reputed journals, the students who are not dealing with the subject on a day to day basis might find it difficult to grasp. We thought over this problem and came up with CosmicVarta as an online platform where we simplify the current astronomical research being carried out so that people from every background can grasp the essence of the results. CosmicVarta is intended to be a portal where the current research is presented in a simplified way and subsequently discussed by people so that everyone can have a glimpse into the exciting world of astronomical research. Through this portal, we will present reviews of recently published articles, interviews with the eminent scientists working in the field of astronomy and astrophysics all over India and also serve as a platform to discuss the research in a simplified manner. Research in astronomy is pursued at only a handful of research institutes, hence prospective students may often find it challenging to find relevant information. Through this portal you may find information regarding the various career options available, various positions available at astronomy institutes in India and other related information. This portal will also serve as an information hub regarding various softwares and databases that are available to be used by the public for free. We can even help students who are looking for short term projects using such a huge volume of data by connecting with the scientists working actively in that area of research. Come join us on a journey which will take you to the wonderful world of stars, galaxies and beyond; and feel enthralled by unlocking the keys to the mysteries of the universe which the scientists are doing on a daily basis. Who are we?We are a group of enthusiastic young researchers, mostly PhD scholars in astrophysics, who wish to make available lndian astronomy research to all interested minds. We keep a track of recent research papers published by lndian astronomers. Their works are written in simple language and published for others to read, understand, enjoy and perhaps motivate them to pursue astronomy research in the future. Allow us to introduce ourselves :)   Lakshitha Nama: Hello. My name is Lakshitha Nama. I am a PhD student at Christ (Deemed to be University).

I make use of imaging and spectroscopic data from X-ray telescopes. My hobbies including reading and painting.   Ketan Rikame: I am a PhD student at CHRIST (Deemed to be University). Field of Instrumentation has always fascinated me and it has been my primary research interest. However, while working with various astronomy instruments, I also got interested in learning about the underlying physical phenomenon these instruments try to study. I have previously worked in optical and radio instrumentation. I am currently part of the instrumentation team at RRI and we are building an X-ray polarimeter approved to be launched on ISRO’s dedicated satellite mission XPOSAT. I also study accretion powered pulsars which will be one of the primary scientific targets of our X-RAY polarimeter. I am very much interested in science popularization. Although not involved in any such activity right now, I love to talk to people about my research (and not bore them hopefully). I love to listen/read about fascinating research other researchers are doing. I also love football!   Vivek Kumar Jha: Hi everyone. I am Vivek. I am a Ph. D student at ARIES, Nainital. My research so far has been about understanding the inner regions of active galaxies.  My PhD thesis is aimed at resolving the inner (sub-parsec) regions of these objects through multi-band observations and infer the structure and kinematics of matter in those locations.  I am also interested in exploring the various all-sky surveys which provide huge amounts of data to be accessed publicly. When not doing research, I usually go trekking in the neighbouring mountains or spend some time listening to classical music. You may find more about me here   Vishal Upendran: Hi there! I am Vishal Upendran, graduate student at the Inter University Centre For Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pune. I have been studying various aspects of the Sun as a part of my thesis. In particular, I am focused on the dynamics of the solar atmosphere, the solar wind and its interaction with the Earth. Apart from physics, I also love machine/deep learning, information theory and the interface of computation and neuroscience. I generally spend my free time reading books - especially on proto/pre history and popular science texts. While not reading, I like going for long walks/runs, cooking and watching anime!   Shridharan Baskaran: Hi all. I am Shridharan Baskaran, Ph. D. student at CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Bangalore. Right from my school days, I’ve been fascinated by the outer space, which led me directly into astrophysics research. I’m currently working on spectroscopic studies of high mass pre-main sequence stars. My research will help in understanding the circumstellar environment around these young stars. I love going on long motorcycle rides, playing board games, and cooking.   Robin Thomas: Hello there! My name is Robin Thomas. I am a PhD student at CHRIST (Deemed to be University). My PhD research aims at understanding the role of interaction in the evolution of galaxies. My research makes use of photometric data from different telescopes. You will find me reading John Grisham and Michael Crichton books outside the office hours. I also love to go on long treks, cycling and cafe hopping.   Anusha R: I’m Anusha. I’m a Ph. D. scholar at the University of Western Ontario. My research mainly focuses on emission-line stars in general relating line properties, formation mechanism, statistical analysis depending on stellar parameters and the circumstellar environment, their disk physics. I am currently working on spectroscopic analysis of Disk forming hot stars and photometric analysis of the effect of binarity on the disk properties. I also perform polarimetric studies on these disk-forming stars exploring their geometry and kinematics as a group. Personally, I am a fanatic of crime thrillers. I’m a classical dancer, blogger, science communicator/enthusiast. I spend quite a good time writing about things I personally admire, from fan-fiction to genetics/cognitive abilities/psychology, etcetera.

    "body": ": Would you like to write for us? Are you involved in astronomy and astrophysics research being conducted in India? Do you wish to share your research results in simple words? Do you want students and public in general to understand what you are working on?If you answer Yes to any of the questions, then CosmicVarta is the platform for you! We are looking for writers actively. Here, you can write about your recent research in simple words and hence, communicate it to the rest of the world. We usually accept articles based on recently accepted papers. Authors, who can review their own papers are most welcome to submit a popular verison of their papers, for wider audience and publicity. There is not fixed format as such, however we generally expect the articles to be short and concise which conveys the essence of the work, in a simplified language. While we accept only English language submissions at the moment, based on the audience and situation we may include articles in native languages in the future. Here are a few guidelines we expect authors to follow before submitting their articles::    The article should be a concise version of the recently accepted/published paper, intended for the general audience. We do not expect technical language. The articles will go through an editorial review by our team and the articles not meeting the criteria will generally need to be revised before being published here.   The submitted article must be about a paper accepted/published within the last 6 months only. However, we also accept review type papers, intended for the general audience, where this limit does not apply.   The submission here should not be published or being considered for publication elsewhere. The responsibility lies with the author to ensure that the article submitted here is original.   Figures are welcome in the article. However, the author has to ensure that the figures do not violate any copyright regulations and prior permisison is available in order to be used here. Note that figures available within arXiv often come with a Creative Commons (CC) license.   The authors will be contacted with a form where they may upload the article and related figures/other material. Do not forget to provide the link to the originally published/accepted paper.  Write for the purpose of visibility among the general masses and for the purpose of disseminating real research results of astronomy among young minds. If you would like to write for us, do fill up the form below and we will contact you. Join Us Our editing guidelines:: Editing an article is similar to reviewing a research paper. However, while a referee needs to primarily focus on the science aspect of the submitted manuscript, a CosmicVarta editor may relax some aspects of the science, since the paper in consideration has already been peer-reviewed. That being said, there are a few guidelines which the editor must follow, and try to incorporate while working with the author. These are listed below:    Each submission will be allotted an editor, who will be coordinating with the author in framing the article in a format suitable for being published at CosmicVarta.   The overarching goal of the editor is to “make the article simple, but not simpler”. That is, the article must be accessible to the reader without compromising on the scientific soundness of the published work by the author.   The general flow of logic in any article is expected to be:  General details and an introduction to global science: This is the most important part of the whole article, since it needs to enrapture and fascinate the reader on the science being done.   A narrower perspective stating the science question, and emphasizing on the importance of the science question: This section starts with the detailing of the subject, which finally leads to the science question being asked in the paper. By the end of this section, the reader must be able to appreciate the science question asked, and also the science studied to answer the same.   Methods and techniques: Generally, this section gets technical in a paper. The editor must ensure the techniques are explained as simply as possible, minimizing technical jargons and details directly irrelevant to the results. While the author may add footnotes for caveats and details, such sub-plots should not lead the reader astray from the science question asked.   Results, conclusions and future work: The author would generally have a tendency to present all the results and their interpretation while drafting the article. Hence, it is the editor’s responsibility to ensure the main results are highlighted well, put into correct local and global context. Other results which would need details may be left out, or hinted at towards the end for the more technical reader.   The editor may suggest graphics in the form of images/gifs to better convey the science, and must ensure these are of good quality (in resolution and science), and are attributed to the correct source(s).   The editor must note that the author’s presentation style may be very different from the editor’s. Since the article is the author’s baby, the editor must not enforce their style of presentation on the author.  Do you want to contribute in any other way?. : If you are passionate about science communication, but want to contribute in any other way, we will consider your request for this option as well. We are seeking people who can help in maintaining our web page as well as other activities related to the handling of articles on this portal. Do get in touch if you are interested in contributing!!!

    "body": "2022/06/18 -  Light when seen correctly provides rich information on what happens in the cosmos. In this article, we showcase our work on identifying signatures of the solar wind in the solar chromosphere – far lower in the solar atmosphere than what has been expected. We take the reader through our analysis, interpretations and speculations on our observations, and present a unified model of solar wind emergence and the heating of quiet corona.  NOTE: This article is a follow-up to “Understanding the solar chromosphere through spectral lines” (which I shall henceforth call #A1) written by yours truly. While I have presented a summary of the previous article here too, possibly you would enjoy reading them together better! Light, as we have seen in #A1, encodes in it information regarding the world. It is especially of great help to astronomers in figuring out what-where-why something happens. For those of us folks who study the Sun, we are bathed – or rather, burnt crisp with light. And so, light or photons carry with them information regarding various aspects of different regions on the Sun. Now, we have seen in #A1 that each element, or ion has a characteristic fingerprint in the form of “spectral lines”. The properties of these spectral lines depend on the plasma properties where the particular ion is present. Critically, it depends on the local temperature, density, velocity, and any other turbulent flows present in the plasma. These show up as effects on the line intensity, the line “shift” and the line width. And so by “reading out” these spectral lines, we can get an estimate of how much plasma is present, how fast it is moving, and in what direction it is moving – at the very least!. The solar atmosphere is composed of the photosphere (at ~5500 K), the chromosphere (at ~10,000 to 80,000 K), Transition region (TR; ~1,00,000 K) and the corona (&gt;10,00,000 K). The rise in temperature with height of the atmosphere is the rather much debated “Coronal heating problem”, which presents more questions than answers1. The corona then extends outwards as the streaming solar wind, with plasma moving at great speeds outwards from the Sun2. The exact reason(s) behind the large temperature of the corona, and the height (or the layer of the atmosphere) from where the solar wind starts are not known well, and are an unsolved problem in solar physics. In #A1, we attempted to understand the underlying cause of these two problems in tandem by studying two regions called the Coronal Holes (CHs) and Quiet Sun (QS). The CHs are regions seen as dark in the corona against the background QS - see Fig. 1, first panel. However, if we go down to the TR (see Si IV in the same figure), or chromosphere (CII or Mg II k3), these differences vanish! Since the CHs are well known sources of the solar wind, studying these two regions together, and investigating where (and how) this differentiation starts can give us hints on resolving the coronal heating and solar wind emergence problems.  Fig. 1: Fig. 1: CHs (dark) and QS (bright) in the corona (AIA 193 Å), TR (Si IV) and the chromosphere (C II, Mg II k3) with the two regions demarcated by light green contours. Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2022 . In #A1, we had studied the C II 1334 Å line - which forms in the upper chromosphere - in CHs and QS as a function of the underlying magnetic field. The general idea was to check if and how these two regions are differentiated depending on the underlying magnetic field. Our results in #A1 told us that QS is brighter than CHs only if we account for the underlying magnetic field. Similarly, we also found that plasma is both preferentially moving towards, and moving away from us (of course at different places!) in CHs, when compared to QS. This motion (and so the velocity) was found to be larger for regions with stronger magnetic fields! Such a result is counterintuitive – the CHs are known to be the source of the wind which travels towards us. Then why do we see the plasma strongly moving away from us? With this backdrop, let us dive into what other ions in the solar atmosphere tell us! Let us proceed systematically here - we are seeing some “anomalous” results in the C II 1334 Å line: a line that forms in the upper chromosphere. A simple way forward would hence be to check the properties of other lines which form in the same region of the chromosphere. And so, we performed the same analysis on what are called Mg II h and Mg II k lines. Mg II - Magnesium - is an awesome atom from which one electron has been removed. The transitions of this atom give rise to what are commonly called the h and k lines. Why do I call it awesome? Because the Mg II h &amp; k lines are very complex – so complex that in fact they can give us the velocity of almost the whole of the chromosphere! If our results in the C II 1334 Å line were correct, they must be seen in what is called the ‘k3’ part of the Mg II line3. However, we also need to have a comparison against some “expected” results. For this, we performed the same analysis on the Si IV 1393 Å line – this line forms in the TR, and so will give very different dynamics when compared to C II or Mg II. Let us look at the results below! Fig. 2: QS-CH differences as a function of magnetic field (|B|) in the TR and chromosphere. The intensity ratio is depicted in panel a and velocity differences in other panels. Panel b depicts the difference in average velocity, while panels c &amp; d show for the blue- and red shifted pixels alone. Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2022 . In Fig 2, I present all the results we find for Mg II k3 and contrast them with Si IV. The way I present it is as follows: for the intensity, we are only interested in the “factor” by which the intensities are different, while for the velocities we are interested in the differences. The dashed lines depict the intensity ratio of 1/ velocity difference of 0 – i. e, case where no differences are seen. From Fig. 2a, the QS shows more intensity than CH - the factor is more than 1. This ratio is larger in Si IV (TR) than in Mg II k3 (chromosphere). This result is consistent with what we expect from physics – as we keep moving above in height, we will keep seeing QS becoming brighter than CH. In Fig. 2b, we check what the average velocity looks like. In the chromosphere the average CH-QS velocities are similar, while in TR the CH is less redshifted. Hence, we clearly see that the solar wind signature is starting to be seen in TR, but apparently not in the chromosphere. In Fig. 2c, we consider only those regions where plasma is moving towards us. Clearly, we see that the CHs have plasma moving much faster towards us than QS. The difference in velocities is also larger in the TR. This is in-line with our expectation of plasma moving towards us in CHs. And finally in Fig. 2d, we consider only those regions where the plasma is moving away from us. Here we see that while the QS plasma is falling down faster in the TR, the case is reversed in CHs! In-line with what we found from C II in #A1, Mg II k3 also tells us that the plasma is preferentially going away from us in CH at the chromosphere3! So this analysis tells us that the result we are seeing is something truly physical But why could this be happening? Is there an “extra” push for the plasma to flow away from us in the CH, or is the plasma being stopped for some reason in the QS? And where are these flows coming from/going to? A clear dichotomy seems to occur between the chromosphere and TR – something is clearly happening at the interface of these two regions. And so to understand further, we study how the TR velocities change with chromospheric velocities. For instance, if a pixel shows upflow in Mg II k4, what kind of flows does it show in Si IV? And how do these vary between CH and QS? This is a question we ask for multiple spectral lines, but I will just present the results for the Mg II k3 and Si IV below.  Fig. 3: TR and chromospheric flow correlations in CHs (black) and QS (orange). Note that up-flows are blueshifts, and downflows are redshifts. Taken from Vishal. U et al. , 2022. In Fig. 3a, we show downflows (=plasma moving away from us) in TR are related to downflows in the chromosphere. Turns out, the plasma that is moving away from us in TR is also seen moving away from us in the chromosphere, except that in QS the speed drastically reduces. Similarly, we can look at how the upflows (=plasma moving towards us) in TR relate to the upflows in the chromosphere in Fig. 3b. Again, it turns out that the plasma that we see coming towards us in the chromosphere is getting accelerated towards us in TR. However, this time the CH plasma is accelerated more than QS! Next, we can also check if the plasma that is coming towards us the TR has any relation to the plasma that is moving away from us in the chromosphere. In Fig. 3c, interestingly, we find that faster the plasma in TR is coming towards us, faster is it also moving away from us in the chromosphere –with the upflows larger in CH. And finally, in Fig. 3d, it turns out that the plasma moving towards us in the chromosphere has not relation whatsoever with the plasma moving away from us in the TR. This is all very interesting, but what does it mean? It means that: (i). If a plasma parcel is moving towards us in the chromosphere, it would be accelerated even more in the TR. This seems like a signature of the solar wind coming towards us, but starting from the chromosphere – or maybe even lower! (ii). Plasma that is flowing down from the TR is decelerated as it falls down into the chromosphere, and this deceleration is much more in QS, and (iii). There seem to be flows coming out like “jets” both towards, and away from us – faster one end comes towards us, faster is the other end moving away from us! What is going on here? Let us handle each observation one by one, and then try to piece them together. First, why would plasma move? Plasma motion takes place if it is either forced to move due to pressure, or if the plasma is freely falling like a ball falls down once it’s thrown up. The freely falling case applies only to plasma that is falling down – for a plasma that is rising, we need something to pump pressure, like a piston. What could this mechanism be? A graphic summary is given in Fig. 4. In the solar atmosphere, it turns out there are complex mechanisms which can heat a small part of the plasma very quickly. Hot air rises, and similarly the plasma will be forced to rise. These complex mechanisms are generally “impulsive events”, for simplicity. These impulsive events are well known in the corona, and have been hypothesized to maintain the coronal temperature at a million degree Kelvin5! Hence, we may invoke a similar impulsive heat dumping mechanism throughout the solar atmosphere to get plasma moving! Now, the density in the solar atmosphere reduces drastically with height. If the amount of mass crossing a surface at a given time is kept constant, it can be shown that the velocity should increase with height (Fig. 4d). Thus, any upflows starting from the lower chromosphere due to these impulsive events will naturally accelerate, and can persist to great heights. Now, these impulsive events basically just dump some energy very quickly in the plasma. Since the plasma just needs to expand (and not only rise), the expansion can occur both ways – upwards and downwards! And if the energy were dumped between the chromosphere and TR, we will see plasma moving towards us in TR, and moving away from us in the chromosphere (Fig. 4a). These are called “bidirectional flows”. Thus, if more energy is dumped by the impulsive event, faster the plasma will move in both directions! Finally, let this event occur at a very great height – in the corona, for example. In such a case, we would only see the downward flowing plasma, since the upward flowing plasma would be seen in lines which form at much higher temperature. Hence this would be seen as persistent downflows (Fig. 4c)! However, note that the “freely-falling” plasma can also simply fall down, and can give a similar signature (Fig. 4b).  Fig. 4: A schematic showing the response of plasma due to an impulsive heating event (red asterisk). The blue arrows correspond to blueshifts (motion towards us), while red arrows show redshifts (motion away from us). The vertical colour is density – going from high density at bottom to low on top. Different scenarios are depicted across the figure. Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2022 . But how does this explain the difference between CH and QS? For this, we invoke something we kind of know from observations: How does the magnetic field approximately look like in CH and QS. In Fig. 5, open magnetic field lines (in black) are drawn near closed loops (in yellow) in CH, while closed loops alone are drawn in QS. When you have magnetic field lines close by, a phenomenon called magnetic reconnection can occur, which causes field lines to snap and rejoin. This will release a large amount of energy contained in the magnetic field in a very short period of time – these would be our impulsive events! Fig. 5: A schematic depicting the proposed picture of impulsive heating occurring across different magnetic field topologies. In the left panel, we show a CH topology, including open funnel-like structure (black), closed loops of varying sizes (yellow), and impulsive events (red asterisks) due to interchange reconnection between the open and closed field lines, giving rise to bidirectional flows (blue and red arrows). The kinked field line propagating outward as a switchback is depicted as a dashed line, with the approximate propagation direction by black arrows. Right panel: QS topology shown with the same terminology as the left panel. Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2022. The reconnection process itself just needs two magnetic field lines, preferably pointing in opposite directions. However, what happens to the plasma after reconnection depends on the overall shape of the field lines, which guide the motion of plasma. Hence, the resultant of reconnection will be different in CH and QS! In the CHs we have “interchange reconnection” between the open field lines and closed loops. While this gives rise to the correlated motion, the plasma is preferentially guided away from the surface (and hence towards us as blueshifts) along the open field line. The open field eventually takes the plasma away, and puts it out into the solar wind. Since plasma is being taken away along the magnetic field, it doesn’t stay and emit enough light for us to see. However, depending on how predominant loops of different heights are, the signatures would be different. Hence, the solar wind may start from a range of heights, with something specific going on in the interface of chromosphere and TR. In the QS, however, the reconnection is only between closed loops. In this case, while the correlated motion is present, the plasma is not allowed to escape into the solar wind, and is kept trapped inside the loop – this and the CH effect above give rise to the intensity ratio of Fig. 2a. ! However, due to the presence of excess plasma at the bottom (remember, cool plasma can just gravitationally fall down towards the photosphere!) in QS, any downflows will be decelerated in QS. Thus, all our observations are naturally explained by invoking magnetic reconnection in what are called different magnetic topologies! But what about the coronal heating problem? We have actually already described it – the reconnection mechanism! Energy dumping by reconnection is precisely the needed means to maintain the solar corona – however, this occurs across various heights in the atmosphere, but predominantly starting from the TR. Finally, one unexpected result from this scheme of things is the generation of what are known as switchbacks. In Fig. 5, the dashed field lines in the CH are how the magnetic field evolves after reconnection. Over the past couple of years, similar structures have been found in the solar wind, and called switchbacks. If the switchbacks form in the chromosphere/ TR, then the velocities that we provide will serve as constraints on the different models to test out the theory! Thus, in one neat sweep, we can potentially unify solar wind emergence, coronal heating, and switchback generation in a single mechanism! Does this mean we have now solved all of these problems? No! On the contrary, we actually need to perform realistic (a subjective word!) simulations of the Sun to check the viability of various aspects of this model. For instance, we still need to understand some of the following questions: how much energy does a typical reconnection event release? How much of this energy is transformed to velocities of different ions? How much of this energy gets radiated away by the plasma? How many reconnection events typically occur in CHs and QS in the first place? Does all of the plasma eventually escape out into the solar wind? If so, do we find similar results while probing hotter (and cooler) spectral lines? These are some typical questions we are trying to answer in a future work!

    "title": "SARAS 3 telescope refutes astrophysical origins of the claimed cosmic dawn signal",
    "body": "2022/06/12 -  SARAS 3 experiment, designed and developed at Raman Research Institute, has conclusively refuted the claim of detection of the signal from cosmic dawn by EDGES experiment. It has become the first experiment worldwide to reach the required sensitivity and cross-verify the claim. Given the unusual nature of the claimed signal, several non-standard cosmological models were proposed. SARAS 3 findings do not support these exotic models proposed previously. The results are now published in Nature Astronomy.  The first light in the Universe Observations of the cosmic microwave background have transformed our knowledge about the first atoms in the Universe. Similarly, we have a reasonable understanding of our local Universe through multi-wavelength observations conducted routinely via Earth and space-bound telescopes. However, there is a knowledge gap in understanding the transition of the Universe from being filled with hydrogen to the Universe as we know it today. The transition encompasses the very first stars and galaxies and ionization of the Universe through radiation emitted by them. This period, referred to as the cosmic dawn and epoch of reionization, poses several questions. These questions include the formation of the first stars in metal-free environments, heating and ionization of the Universe via radiation from these first stars, and timelines for various events in this period (https://www. cfa. harvard. edu/~loeb/sciam. pdf). One of the ways to answer these questions is to observe the cosmic dawn through radiation emitted by hydrogen atoms. Due to spin-flip transition, the hydrogen atom emits radiation at 21-cm wavelength (rest-frame frequency of 1420. 4 MHz) (https://www. cv. nrao. edu/~sransom/web/Ch7. html#S8). The 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn is expected to arrive on Earth stretched in wavelength to meters and lowered in frequency by the expansion of the Universe to lie in the radio frequency band 50-200 MHz. Each frequency would provide a snapshot of the Universe at a given instant! However, detecting a signal from such an early period of the Universe is extremely difficult. The same frequency range is home to several terrestrial interference sources, including FM and TV stations, satellites, power line transmissions, etc. Even if one were to avoid all the terrestrial interference, our Galaxy emits radiation that is 100,000 times stronger than the strength of the signal! Another part of the challenge is that we do not know what the 21-cm signal looks like, unlike some other cosmological signals. While we have some broader ideas about its nature, its exact characteristics cannot be known owing to our poor understanding of the first stars. It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack while not knowing what the needle really looks like. In such high precision measurements, the radio telescope must have high calibration accuracy to separate the contributions from the instrument, terrestrial interference, and the Galaxy to finally get down to the treasured 21-cm signal. Any small miscalibration of the telescope can lead to a false detection or limit us from reaching the sensitivity levels needed to detect the signal. SARAS experiment SARAS experiment at Raman Research Institute (RRI) is custom designed to detect the faint 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn. SARAS has been meticulously designed and calibrated to measure sky radiation to an accuracy of 0. 0001%. Once built and tested, it is deployed in the remotest sites in India to observe the night skies in a minimum terrestrial interference environment. The observations span over a few weeks, followed by months of analysis, refinement of the design, and re-deployments for a fresh season of observations. Several surveys were conducted early on to find sites conducive to such experiments.   Figure 1: Evolution of SARAS experiment and sites over the years (Credits: Author) EDGES result EDGES is a radio telescope operating in Western Australia. It is led by astronomers at Arizona State University and MIT. The experiment claimed detection of the 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn in March 2018 (https://www. nature. com/articles/nature25792). This was the first discovery claim in the field of 21-cm cosmology and rightly created much excitement in the astronomy community worldwide. However, the detection looked nothing like the theoretical predictions. The strength of the reported signal was at least twice compared to theoretical predictions. Therefore, the EDGES claim of detection led to several speculations about how the Universe might differ from current understanding. These speculations included exotic physics, non-standard cosmology, a new population of galaxies, and new models of dark matter that may have resulted in such an unusual signal. However, appreciating that in such difficult measurements, errors in instrument calibration might result in spurious deductions, cross verification of such a claim had become an urgent priority.   Figure 2: 21-cm signals as predicted by standard cosmology (colored lines) and the detection by EDGES experiment (dashed black line) (Credits: Author). Latest Deployment The third edition of the telescope, SARAS 3, was deployed on lakes with a focused goal to cross-verify the EDGES claim. This was the first instance ever for a radio telescope to observe on water. The reason for floating the telescope on the water is to provide a homogenous medium of high dielectric constant below the antenna. Such a medium enhances telescope performance and reduces confusing radio waves emitted by the very ground beneath radio telescopes. After an extensive search, two lakes in Karnataka, Dandiganahalli Lake and Sharavati backwaters, were selected for observations. The observations were carried out in January and March 2020, ending with a lockdown in Bangalore!    Figure 2: SARAS 3 deployment (Credits: Author) Analysis and Findings Before one can start looking for the presence of the cosmological signature in the data, several corrections are required. These include calibrating the “bandpass response” of the telescope, rejecting the interference signals from terrestrial sources, accounting for the varying efficiency of the antenna over the observed frequency range, and subtracting off the contributions from the telescope and water. This process is followed by adopting a model that represents our knowledge about the emission from the Galaxy and any residual contributions left by the instrument. Once we have a model, we can ask whether the claimed cosmological signal exists in the processed data. By adopting several different methods of asking this question, SARAS 3 observations found no evidence of the signal via each of them. The signal was rejected at 95. 3% confidence. Therefore, the finding implies that the detection reported by EDGES was plausible contamination from their instrument and not a signature from the early Universe. SARAS 3 was indeed the first experiment to reach the required sensitivity and cross-verify the claim of the signal detection. However, 21-cm signal from the early Universe continues to elude astronomers worldwide! Having rejected the EDGES claim, SARAS 3 team is planning more observations on remote lakes in India. At the same time, there is a strong motivation to find pristine sites with little to no interference. One of the best sites imaginable is the far side of the Moon! Effectively shielded from both the Sun and the Earth, it is one of the quietest sites in the solar system to conduct cosmological observations. Therefore, we are proposing a space-based payload, PRATUSH, that would orbit the Moon, conducting observations when in the far side (https://wwws. rri. res. in/DISTORTION/pratush. html). It is currently under study phase, supported by ISRO. Such expeditions will allow us to detect the 21-cm signal from the cosmic dawn and unravel this last remaining gap in the history of our Universe.

    "title": "Bending of Cosmic fountains, giving birth to a peculiar X-shaped galaxy",
    "body": "2022/06/04 -  When observed with a radio telescope, a giant peculiar X-shaped morphology is seen in some galaxies. It is difficult to understand what gives rise to such peculiar morphology; And, to date, this is a topic of debate among astronomers themselves.  Some of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that are billion times more massive than the sun reside at the centre of giant galaxies become active. During this active phase, the SMBH begins to rapidly accrete matter (hot ionized gas/plasma), some of which is violently thrown away along the SMBH’s spin axis by a complex process triggered by a strong magnetic disturbance. Hence, these active SMBHs usually throw jets of hot material out to large distances (out to a few billion light-years) with a velocity nearly the speed of light. These ejected jets resemble a structure that can very well be labelled as cosmic fountains. These jets typically consist of relativistic magnetised hot plasma (as the plasma is thrown, it also takes some of the magnetic field with it), which produce an outburst of radio emission via the synchrotron process. What’s surprising is that jet ejecta, which is expected to follow a particular path (a straight line; determined by the spin axis of the SMBH), sometimes bend from it and form a peculiar morphology that looks like the English letter ‘X’. So, when someone observes these galaxies with a radio telescope, they will find a giant X-like structure floating in the vast cosmos. It is difficult to understand what gives rise to such peculiar morphology; And, to date, this is a topic of debate among astronomers themselves.   In a recent study led by our team of astrophysicists including Indian and Italian scientists, have addressed this issue by re-investigating the formation mechanism of such structures computationally. We identified a possible origin hidden within the host galaxy shape itself. This is quite similar to the Bengali saying, The ghost is already hiding in plain sight. Using computer simulations performed using the Max Planck supercomputing cluster in Germany, we demonstrated the complex relationship between the X-morphology formation and the shape of the host elliptical galaxy, which plays a key role in deflecting the material hurled out by the supermassive black hole. To be specific, the already existing interstellar gas distribution of the galaxy itself is found responsible for deflecting the ejected hot plasma by the black hole sideways, giving the cosmic fountain (the ejected jet) an X-shape. In scientific terms, we demonstrated that as the jet propagates through the denser interstellar gas distribution of the galaxy, the jet head becomes unstable. As a result, it creates lots of back-flowing plasma material that traverse back again towards the centre of the galaxy. While doing so, the host galaxy specifies a path for its motion by providing a path with a maximum pressure gradient (the pressure gradient generates a force), which lies along the minor axis of the galaxy (i. e. , along the shorter dimension of an ellipse). This generated force causes a deflection in the back-flowing plasma, creating the wing structure. Observational studies often find such alignments of these back-flowing materials along the minor axis of the host galaxy, which further supports our findings.   Our novel simulation has also shed light on a decade-old problem of these radio galaxies, which led our work towards a publication in a very prestigious European journal named Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics by ESO (European Southern Observatory). The problem is noted below: Based on the properties of wing structure (which is less intense and rather diffuse than the active lobe), it was believed that the wing is a passively evolving feature (i. e. , simply evolves under normal adiabatic expansion) compared to the active lobe, where the jet is currently in an active stage (by continuously filling itself with fresh and young plasma material from the SMBH). A similar characteristic has also been observed in our simulation showing the active lobe possessing freshly injected particles from the active galactic core, whereas the wing accumulates the older particles that back-flow from the jet head. Based on this, it can be stated that the active lobe should possess spectral index values flatter than the wing (flatter spectra mean younger particles; characteristics of synchrotron radiation). However, in observational studies, no systematic difference in the radio emission (hence in the spectral index) has been found in the four different arms of the X-shape. This further highlights that from a theoretical standpoint, there is a clear lag in the understanding of these galaxies’ emission processes, seriously contradicting the existing formation models. It has also led scientists to address these objects as peculiar sources. This work led by Gourab Giri and the team has offered a resolution to this issue with a critical analysis of these radio galaxies. They highlight that shock acceleration processes of ultra-fast electrons (travelling nearly at the speed of light!) cause such peculiar emission characteristics. A shock wave is a wave that is generated by a moving object when its speed of movement exceeds the speed of sound in that medium. In our work, we explicitly showed the origin of these shock waves in the four arms of X-shaped structure and hence their influence on the radio emission of such peculiar morphologies. The conclusion which came out from our work is that the shock acceleration significantly re-energizes the plasma by speeding them up (hence altering their spectra), keeping the particles alive which instead would have lost all their energy under several dominant cooling processes (radiative and adiabatic cooling). Most importantly, the wing, which was thought of as a passively growing structure of X-shaped galaxies, is actually very active as it produces shock acceleration sites in it. The shocks are generated due to the diverted back-flowing material, as also shown by the black arrow in Fig. 2, making the wing actively evolving. This can single-handedly explain the peculiar emission characteristics observed in X-shaped radio galaxies including the signature where no systematic difference in the emission of lobe and wing is found. Our work has already been appreciated by a greater scientific community. Additionally, the prestigious journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics has also decided to feature our work on the cover page of their upcoming volume. This work is already available on the arXiv preprint server, handled by Cornell University, the USA for open-source science.

    "title": "How much Metal does the Quiet Sun Corona contain?",
    "body": "2022/05/16 -  XSM onboard Chandrayaan-2 observed the Sun during the deepest solar minimum of the past century from in 2019-2020. By studying the XSM spectra for the days when the Sun was very quiet, researchers have found that the abundances of all Mg, Al, Si is around two times higher than its abundances in the photosphere! They also calculated the temperature of the quiet Sun corona to be around 2 MK. This article explains how these measurements were made.  The visible orange-yellow surface of the Sun that we can see even with the naked eye is called the Photosphere. It extends up to a height of 400 km. The temperature here decreases from 6000K, at the bottom of the layer, to 4500K at the top of the layer. This is expected because as we move away from a source of energy and heat, the temperature drops. The next layer is the Chromosphere, that is in between a height of about 400 - 2100 km. The temperature in the Chromosphere varies between about 4000 K at the bottom and 8000 K at the top. As the numbers show, in the Chromosphere, as we move upwards it gets hotter and not cooler as common sense suggests! More mystifyingly, things get extremely hot (literally) as we move into the next layer, the transition region, which is just a 100 km in height but the temperature drastically increases from a few thousand kelvin to a few million kelvin! Temperature stays at a million degree kelvin in the Corona (which extends throughout the solar system) as well, which is the uppermost atmospheric layer of the Sun. The reason for this temperature increase in the solar atmosphere is one of the long standing problems of solar physics referred to as the Coronal Heating Problem. You can read more about this in the article: Using machine learning to infer Solar Coronal heating Figure 1: The Sun and its layers. Credit: Hinode. The Corona is mainly visible in UV and X rays. This is because the hotter a material is, the light coming from it will be of higher energy. You can see this in daily life in the flames of a stove. The innermost regions of the fire will be bluish compared to the outer parts, which will be red, orange and yellow. As we have seen, since the Corona is at a million degree kelvin temperature, it emits mainly in the high energy part of the spectrum, that is, in UV and X-rays, while the Photosphere emits mainly in optical wavelengths that we can perceive with our naked eyes. This means that telescopes on the Earth are enough to observe and study the Photosphere. But since the ozone layer blocks UV and X rays (thankfully, otherwise we would not exist as we do now!), Coronal studies began only with advent of the space age and satellites in the 1960s. Another phenomenon that is related and similarly astonishing to the ‘Coronal Heating Problem’ that occurs in the transition region and the Corona is called as the First Ionization Potential (FIP) Effect. This effect deals with the abundances of elements in the Corona. Soon after the launch of the first satellites with instruments to study the Sun in UV and X rays, Stuart R. Pottasch in 1963 found something very weird concerning the elements present in the Corona. Using spectroscopy, that is, by studying light from the Corona, he discovered that the absolute abundances (i. e. , the abundances with respect hydrogen) of certain elements the low FIP elements like magnesium (Mg), silicon (Si) and iron (Fe) were mode abundant (3-4 times higher!) in the Corona than in the Photosphere. Now you might ask why is this surprising? After all, Corona is a different layer with a very different temperature. So, why can’t it have different abundances of elements than the Photosphere, right? This is because all the material that is present in the Corona comes from the lower atmospheric layers through flares and Coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Flares and CMEs are huge explosions that supply material and energy from the Photosphere to the Corona. So it was expected that the elemental abundances in the Corona will reflect that of the Photosphere. The theories that are trying to explain the FIP effect predict that the FIP effect and the Coronal Heating Problem are intimately connected with each other. Thus studying one problem might give insights about the other and vice versa! Over the years, many studies of the FIP effect have shown that the amount of FIP effect, which basically tells by how much the (low FIP) elements in the Corona are more compared to the Photosphere, is different in different structures of the Corona. Sun’s activity changes with an approximate period of 11 years called as the solar cycle. At the start of a cycle, large flares and CMEs on the sun are usually non-existent. With the progress of the cycle, activity increases, reaches a maximum and starts coming down again before the start of the next cycle. Studies have also shown that the elemental abundance in the Corona changes in accordance with the solar cycle. It is relatively easier to study the Corona when explosions (flares and CMEs) happen. This is because the Sun is very active and outputs a large amount of UV and X rays which the instruments can receive. But studying the Sun when it is quiet requires extremely sensitive instruments to be present and observing the Sun. Here comes in Chandrayaan-2 live a saviour! The Chandrayaan-2 mission was launched in July 2019 and the orbiter carried an instrument called Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM), which is till date the most sensitive instrument to measure the sun’s spectra (light). For more information on XSM, refer to the article:Deciphering The Mysteries of The Quiet Sun Explosions. 2019 also marked the end of solar cycle 24 during which the sun was extremely quiet. This was the quietest the sun has been in the past 100 years! Thus with the Sun in its deep minimum and the XSM observing its inactivity, Santosh Vadawale and team have managed to decode the abundances of three (low FIP) elements - Mg, Al and Si - in the quiescent Corona using spectroscopy. Spectroscopy is the study of light of different energies that is emitted by a source. The instrument that is used for spectroscopy is called as a spectroscope/spectrometer. And the output of a spectroscope is a spectrum (plural - spectra). A spectrum is basically a graph of intensity (or count rate which gives the number of photons) versus the wavelength (or energy) of light. It is possible to derive the temperature and other physical parameters by studying the shape of the spectrum (known as the continuum), and by studying the bumps (called as ‘emission lines or emission complexes’), it is possible to derive the abundances of various elements present in the source (see figure 2). Each emission line is a ‘signature’ of a different element. By modelling (i. e. , comparing the strength of the observed line and shape of the continuum with that predicted by theory) the spectra, we can find the abundances and other physical parameters. For more in-depth information about spectroscopy, please refer to: Understanding the solar chromosphere through spectral lines.  Figure 2: Soft X-ray spectra measured by the XSM for two representative days of quiet Sun observations are shown. Solid lines represent the best fit isothermal model and the residuals are shown in the bottom panel. Gray points correspond to non-solar background spectrum. Credit: S. Vadawale et al. , 2021. By studying the XSM spectra for 73 days when the Sun was very quiet, they found that the abundances of all three elements (Mg, Al, Si) were around two times higher than the corresponding photospheric abundances. They also calculated the temperature of the quiet Sun to be around 2 MK.  Figure 3: Light curve for the duration of the XSM observations used in this study. Orange shaded regions are duration when active regions were present on the Sun, pink shaded regions are duration when the Sun showed enhanced X-ray activity, and blue shaded regions are duration of quiet Sun observations. Credit: S. Vadawale et al. , 2021. As no activity was happening on the Sun, XSM was even able to measure the absolute lowest X-ray energy emitted by the Sun, which is about 6 x 10-10 Wm-2. For comparison, the highest soft X-ray energy emitted by the Sun is of the order of 10-4  Wm-2, which is 6 orders of magnitude higher!

    "title": "EARTH-SIZED TELESCOPES FOR ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS IN THE LOW RADIO FREQUENCIES",
    "body": "2022/04/24 -  The study of the cosmos is only complete when we can receive and analyse data from the entire electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from picometer-sized gamma rays to several meters long radio waves. This realization is what led to the advent of multiwavelength astronomy. But even in today’s era when technology has paved the way for us to observe the sky in a very wide range of wavelengths, it still remains poorly explored at wavelengths greater than a few tens of meters. This is mainly because the Earth’s ionosphere blocks most of these wavelengths. Even if we could observe them, it would require us to build a telescope several kilometres wide to properly resolve the sources, which is physically impossible. This article is a review of a journal paper that tackles these issues by proposing to simulate an Earth-sized radio telescope. The paper dwells into some technical details on how we can achieve a radio telescope larger than the size of the Earth and discusses the advantages such a system would offer. This article tries to simplify the concepts involved, and introduce the readers to an exciting new domain in radio astronomy. While it is for sure physically impossible to build a telescope larger than even a few hundreds of meters, you might be wondering how the paper suggests we build a telescope not just a few kilometres wide, but larger than the entire diameter of the Earth, which is just shy of 13,000km! To achieve such a feat, it is proposed we build several small observing elements and send them to space, to revolve around the Earth in different orbits. Then we employ some analysis techniques which can cumulatively be known as Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI, or more specifically, orbiting VLBI in our case, as our observing elements are all in orbit) to “stitch” the multiple images taken by each of these elements and produce a high-resolution image of the entire sky. Before we dive further into the how, what and why of the paper, let us first understand in some detail, these concepts involved. Introduction: Radio astronomy is a subfield of astronomy that studies the universe in the radio spectrum (ranging from 1mm to 100km wavelengths). To fulfil this purpose, radio astronomy takes multidisciplinary contributions from physics, electronics and computer sciences alike. Radio waves are so large that we cannot practically use the typical lens and mirror arrangements that we use to observe in most other electromagnetic (EM) spectra. Lucky for us, the larger wavelengths mean smaller frequencies, small enough that we can “see” the crests and troughs of the wave using an antenna – yes, the same antenna that is in our smartphones and TV dishes! In fact, we can actually use our smartphones and TV dishes to observe the radio sky, albeit with a few modifications.   Figure 1: The electromagnetic spectrum and the atmospheric opacity for different wavelengths. While the Earth’s atmosphere is almost completely transparent to short-wavelength radio waves, it is completely opaque to wavelengths longer than 15m. (Source: http://gisgeography. com/electromagnetic-radiation/) A few advantages of observing in the radio frequencies include the fact that most of the high frequency radio waves completely pass through the Earth’s atmosphere. So, we are able to perform ground-based observations, which are cheaper and less complicated. It is also possible to observe astronomical objects or phenomena that are nearly impossible to detect in other wavelengths. But where there are advantages, there are disadvantages as well. Radio waves having wavelengths greater than 15m are blocked completely by the ionosphere, as can be seen from Figure 1, rendering it impossible to make any observations of the radio sky at those wavelengths using ground-based telescopes. Radio waves also tend to be plagued by man-made radio frequency interference (RFI). These can be any signals generated by us, such as the FM and TV frequencies, mobile communication signals, signals from any and all electronic equipment we use, all of which corrupt the astronomical radio signals, making it difficult to study them from the ground. Being able to see the sky at wavelengths greater than 15m is important, because it is expected to be extremely bright with never-before-seen astronomical phenomena. At the risk of using a few technical jargons, the sky at these frequencies will be dominated by non-thermal emissions, such as synchrotron emission, as well as free-free absorption from the thermal plasma that outer space has an abundance of. Interested readers can learn more about these phenomena by referring to this article. Therefore, in order to grab this unprecedented opportunity to observe these new astronomical processes and to avoid the drawbacks of ground-based radio telescopes, we must go to space. VLBI, Visibility and the Image Plane: Interferometry is a measurement technique that relies on the phenomenon of interference of light waves to produce a fringe (interference) pattern. Young’s double slit experiment and Michelson’s interferometer are two common experiments that most of you might have performed in your physics labs in your high school days. VLBI is nothing but an extension of this technique for microwaves and radio waves. In VLBI, a signal from an astronomical source is collected using multiple radio telescopes (called as an array) placed some distance apart. Next, the distance between the radio telescopes is calculated using the difference between the time of arrival of the radio signals at different telescopes. This time difference is usually very small and is caused as the telescopes are located some finite distance apart. This allows observations of an object that are made simultaneously by many radio telescopes to be combined, thus creating a telescope with a size equal to the maximum separation between the telescopes, which is known as the maximum baseline. Since a radio telescope is nothing but an antenna, the signals received by each telescope are converted into voltages. These voltage signals are then amplified, filtered, digitized and then sent to the correlator, a digital device that cross-correlates the signals received from all the telescopes to produce the final image. In simple terms, the correlator “multiplies” each signal with every other signal and computes how well they are related. VLBI is a very popular technique in radio astronomy because it enables the distance between telescopes to be much greater than that possible with conventional interferometry, which requires antennas to be physically connected by coaxial cables or other types of transmission lines. This, in turn, allows for the resultant images to be of much higher resolution. This can be inferred using the Rayleigh’s criterion, which specifies the minimum separation between two astronomical sources that may be resolved into distinct objects. This angular resolution (expressed in arcseconds) for any telescope is given by: where, λm is the wavelength (in meters) and D_km is the size of the effective aperture of the telescope (in kms). In case of any interferometric technique, the size of the effective aperture will be equivalent to the maximum baseline of the radio telescope array. So, to sum it up, we can infer from Rayleigh’s criterion that the angular resolution is directly proportional to the wavelength and inversely to the effective aperture. Therefore, to obtain resolutions comparable to that in visible astronomy, radio astronomers must build telescopes a billion times the size, which is impractical. Instead, they employ VLBI, which gives them the option to use multiple smaller aperture telescopes to synthesize a larger aperture, at the expense of collecting area. ow that we understand the basics of VLBI, let us move on to the next important concept, which is visibility (also known as complex visibility or interferometric visibility by non-radio astronomers). In radio astronomy, visibility is defined as the response of the interferometer, which is the 2-dimensional Fourier transform of the sky brightness distribution. Fourier transform is a mathematical function that decomposes a time signal (which in our case, is the signal that a radio telescope receives) into the frequencies that make it up. This video beautifully explains the concept of Fourier transform, and is a must watch for anyone interested. The sky brightness distribution is given by T(l,m), which is the intensity of radio waves coming from a particular location (l,m) in the sky, where l and m are angles and measured in radians. Finally, visibility is given by V(u,v), which is a complex function of signals correlated from all the radio telescopes in the array. This visibility is measured at a position (u,v) on any user-defined plane (called the image plane or the uv-plane) which usually is the ground for ground-based arrays. The u and v axes are measured in wavelengths (or km, in our case). The image plane can be considered as a simulated aperture of a telescope, and each telescope pair in the array would give two V(u,v) samples (for simplicity, we’ll hereon refer to it as just uv-sample) on the plane at a given time. So, an interferometer array with N telescopes will have N(N - 1)/2 baselines and give twice that number of samples.   Figure 2: The first picture shows three different configurations of the Submillimeter Array represented in blue, red and black colours. They are observing a source at a Dec of +22˚ at a frequency of 345 GHz. The second image shows the total uv-plane coverage when observing for 8 hours, as the telescopes move due to the Earth’s rotation, forming new baselines, and thus, new uv-samples. The black samples are due to the array configuration shown in black and so on. (Source: http://anita. edu. au/lectures) To better understand the concept of image plane, imagine the screen on your phone or computer is the image plane. Now, let’s say every second a pair of telescopes in the interferometer array generates two samples, which correspond to two pixels on your screen. The more the telescopes you have in your array, the more samples are produced every second and the more pixels on your screen light up. Also, the longer you observe a source, the more unique baselines are formed, and again the more pixels on your screen light up. Ideally, we would want all the pixels on the screen to be lit up so that the source being observed is 100% imaged. But that is not possible because the telescopes in our array are separated from each other, and no matter how long you observe, there will always be dark spots on your screen, i. e. , gaps on the image plane. What we can infer from this is that for better imaging, we would need better coverage of the uv-plane, which can be done by observing a specific source over a longer period of time. Refer to Figure 2 for a better visual explanation. To get a better grasp on the concepts of VLBI, visibility, the image plane and radio interferometry in general, interested readers can refer to this article for a basic discussion and this one for a slightly more advanced coverage of the topics. If you aren’t much of a reader, then this 2-video series also does a fantastic job at simplifying these concepts. The system proposed by the paper extends all these concepts into space, with the radio telescopes now aboard satellites revolving around the Earth. Orbiting VLBI is not a new concept in radio astronomy and the proof of concept was shown as early as 1986, by the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) launched by NASA. Following that came the Space VLBI Satellite: MUSES-B under the Japanese VLBI Space Observatory Program (VSOP) and RadioAstron (Spektr-R) operated by the Russian Astro Space Center. An extensive study of the past, present and future of space VLBI can be found in this paper. But all of these multi-element space-based radio interferometers have only been used in conjunction with ground-based telescopes, therefore, rendering them unusable for observations in the lower frequency window that we’re interested in. The increasing interest in the low frequency radio sky, though, has resulted in several fully space-based interferometric missions being proposed such as the Low-Cost Space-based Ultra-long wavelength Radio Observatory (SURO-LC) and Orbiting Low Frequency Antennas for Radio Astronomy (OLFAR), to name a few. These proposed swarms of small satellites would be orbiting close to the Earth or at other special locations within our solar system, such as the Lagrange L2 point or the lunar orbit and would have a large number of observing elements working together in aperture synthesis mode, but with baseline lengths limited to only about a 100 km or so. The novelty of the model proposed by this paper lies in the fact that by performing sensitive imaging observations with very high angular resolutions at low frequencies, we can reveal astronomical objects and phenomena that have never been seen before. These are the prospects that led to the simulation of a suitable space interferometer system so as to enable such high-resolution imaging. The Model: The model was simulated keeping in consideration to have a minimal number of observing elements to view the entire sky. Intuitively, we can see that having just two telescopes in space is not going to be sufficient, so the model begins by assuming three observing elements mounted on satellites in mutually orthogonal and near-circular Low Earth Orbits (LEO), which is an orbit ranging from 300km to 2000km above the Earth’s surface, as shown in Figure 3. Each of the observing elements is assumed to have a uniform field of view (FoV) of 2π steradians (in other words, the telescope can see the entire hemisphere in front of it). Such a configuration would allow us to have baselines of over 15000km, which is larger than the diameter of the Earth, thus enabling angular resolution as fine as 1 arcsec (from Rayleigh’s criterion) even at 4 MHz (or wavelength of 75m). The three satellites have different orbital heights, making their orbital periods distinct from each other. These orbital heights are deliberately chosen such that the orbits are mutually asynchronous. This ensures that the apparent baselines are distinctly different during each orbital cycle, thus giving a significantly better coverage of the uv-plane in a relatively short time span. The orbital speeds and time periods of the satellites can be calculated from the Newton’s law of gravitation:  where, G (= 6. 6710-11 Nm2/kg2) is the universal gravitational constant, Me (= 5. 9821024 kg), R (= 6371km) is the radius of Earth, and h is the orbital height of the satellite above the Earth’s surface.   Figure 3: An illustration of the model configuration: The near circular orbits (not to scale, and appearing in projection as ellipses) for the three satellites are shown. The first satellite has an equatorial orbit (red), and the other two (Satellites 2 and 3) have polar orbits (blue and green, respectively). The black circle in the centre denotes the Earth. (Source: Figure 2 of the paper. ) The various parameter values defined for each satellite are given in Table 1. These values were obtained by extensively testing the sensitivity of the uv-plane coverage to these parameters. The orbital height of satellite 1 is chosen to be greater than 700 km so as to be able to avoid the effects of atmospheric drag which are substantial at heights below 400 km as well as to avoid attenuation of the radio waves due to the ionospheric plasma which is significant at orbital heights below 700 km.       Index    Orbital Height (h)    Orbital Speed (s)    Time period (T)        Satellite 1    770 km    7. 48 km/s    100. 01 min        Satellite 2    1085 km    7. 32 km/s    106. 70 min        Satellite 3    1400 km    7. 17 km/s    113. 53 min  Since the model is different from the usual Earth-based and Earth-and-space-based interferometer systems, the typical definition of the uv-plane as the ground plane would not suffice. So, the uv-plane was explicitly defined in a different manner, with its origin at the centre of the Earth and the plane perpendicular to the direction of the source being observed. After extensive testing, an observing period of 16 days was found to be optimal. In order to obtain the maximum and minimum possible uv-plane coverages during this observation period as well as to find out the extent of the coverages, three exclusive source directions are chosen representing the extreme cases (as shown in Figure 3). These directions, namely A, B, and C, are defined as follows:  Direction A: RA = 03:00:00 Dec = +45 deg, inclined equally to all three satellite orbit axes.  Direction B: RA = 03:00:00 Dec = 0. 0 deg, representing a set of specific directions that are perpendicular to one of the satellite orbit axes (or in the plane of that orbit) and inclined equally with the other two.  Direction C: RA = 00:00:00 Dec = 0. 0 deg, perpendicular to any two of the satellite orbit axes and parallel to the third axis. It can be easily visualized that any source in the sky would fall within the bounds of these three directions relative to them. The corresponding uv-plane coverages are shown in Figure 4 and the evolution of the coverages over these 16 days can be viewed at this link.   Figure 4: The uv-coverages over the duration of 16 days, for the three source directions A, B and C from left to right. The red, blue, and green tracks represent the baseline corresponding to the satellite pairs 1–2, 2–3, and 3–1, respectively. The u and v axes are indicated in km. (Source: Figure 3 of the paper. ) Measuring this coverage quantitatively, it is found that the percentage coverage lies between a maximum of 64% and a minimum of 55. 5% for any source for an observation period of 16 days, which is significantly greater than what we usually obtain with ground-based interferometer setups (which is typically around 15% for the same observing duration). So, the model not only has much greater baselines, but is also capable of giving significantly better coverage for any source, which would ultimately result in very fine angular resolutions and better imaging capabilities at low radio frequencies. The paper then proceeds to discuss the sensitivity of this coverage to the satellite orbits so as to be able to determine the best relative positions of the satellites with respect to each other. Next, it discusses the quality of the final image based on the simulations. Finally, it compares our minimal 3-satellite model with another 4-satellite model, to examine how much of an advantage adding a fourth satellite would be, how that would be reflected in terms of the improvement in uv-coverage and the time taken to obtain the desired coverage. The results indicate that even with a system of four satellites (and six baselines) the total percentage coverage is essentially similar to that obtained with three satellites when observed for the same time duration of 16 days. Although it is noted that when observed for shorter durations, the percentage coverage by the 4-satellite system is noticeably more than that of the 3-satellite one. In conclusion, we discuss the importance of a fully space-based interferometer to observe the low frequency sky with very high angular resolutions and uv-plane coverages and that a minimal configuration with just three elements is optimum for the purpose scientifically, technologically and economically. Easier said than done though, because going to space entails its own challenges. While an elaborate study of them is beyond the scope of this paper, it does acknowledge some of the major ones and discusses possible solutions, showing that there are ways to not only overcome these challenges, but also use them to our advantage.

    "title": "Identifying emission-line stars from a large spectroscopic database",
    "body": "2022/03/16 -  We present a catalog of 3339 hot emission-line stars (ELS) identified from 451,695 O, B, and A type spectra, provided by the LAMOST DR5 release. We developed an automated python routine that identified 5437 spectra having a peak between 6561 and 6568~Å. False detections and bad spectra were removed, leaving 4138 good emission-line spectra of 3339 unique ELS. We re-estimated the spectral type of 3307 spectra as the LAMOST Stellar Parameter Pipeline (LASP) did not provide accurate spectral types for these emission-line spectra. As Herbig Ae/Be stars show higher excess in near-infrared and mid-infrared wavelengths than Classical Ae/Be stars, we used 2MASS and WISE photometry to distinguish them. Finally, we report 1089 Classical Be, 233 Classical Ae, and 56 Herbig Ae/Be stars identified from the LAMOST DR5. In addition, 928 B[em]/A[em] stars and 240 CAe/CBe potential candidates are identified. From our sample of 3339 hot emission-line stars, 2716 ELS identified in this work do not have any record in the SIMBAD database and they can be considered as new detections. Identification of such a large homogeneous set of emission-line spectra will help the community to study the emission phenomenon in detail without worrying about the inherent biases when compiling from various sources.  To understand what emission line stars (ELS) are, one needs to know about the spectrum of a star. Each star has its own unique spectrum, analogous to the fingerprint of humans. A spectrum can be used to identify the properties of the star such as its temperature, chemical composition and (indirect) physical constraints. So clearly, spectroscopy of cosmic objects can reveal lots of information about the universe. Now, let us ask a more basic question. What is a spectrum? To understand this, imagine a rainbow on a rainy day. A rainbow is formed when the sunlight passes through the water molecules suspended in the air after the rain. As the sunlight moves through a spherical water droplet, it gets dispersed into various colours ranging from Violet to Red. This is a real-life example of spectroscopy. The light from a stellar object, when passed through a slit or a prism (the optical equivalent of the spherical water droplet), gets split into various colours. If the light from the star is as ideal as white light is, which is made up of all the colors with equal intensity, we would get a beautiful color gradient with all colors shining equally. However, the universe is not that simple. The spectrum of a star will have bright and dark lines, similar to the way we have ridges and valleys in our fingerprint (Figure 1).   Figure 1: A representative high-resolution spectrum showing the visible light of alpha Boo. The black lines in this spectrum are caused due to various metallic elements present in the photosphere of the cool giant alpha Boo. Image source:N. A. Sharp, NOIRLab/NSF/AURA) . These bright and dark lines (or emission and absorption lines) are the most crucial information of the spectrum. They tell us about the atomic and molecular processes going on in the top most layer of the star which is known as the photosphere. An absorption line is formed in the spectrum when light of a certain wavelength is absorbed by an atom or a molecule. Similarly, an emission line is formed when light of a certain wavelength is emitted (or radiated) by an atom or a molecule. To put it simply, when an atom ‘absorbs’ light, it goes into a higher energy level and when it ‘emits’ light, it comes down to a lower energy level as shown in Figure 2.   Figure 2: The above plots show the absorption and emission process as caused by the excitation and de-excitation of electrons around the nucleus. Image source:webassign . The spectrum of a star is the information that gives us the intensity at each wavelength of light. An observed stellar spectrum consists of the blackbody continuum, absorption lines and in some cases, emission lines. The blackbody continuum in the visible and infrared region is due to the thermal emission of the star and the absorption lines are seen because the ‘cooler’ photosphere absorbs light at certain wavelengths. These two components are seen in the spectrum of all the stars because it arises due to the basic structure of stars. Now let us come to the topic of this article, ELS. Emission lines arise from a hot, gaseous region around the star that is formed due to some special nature of the star. The type of stars that show emission lines in their spectrum are called Emission line stars (ELS). You can call them the rebellious group of star families, who want to be unique by showing emission lines. There are various types of ELS known to us today (and its analogues)Pre-main sequence (PMS) stars - young, naughty teenagers creating chaosClassical Be stars - people with midlife crisisWolf-Rayet stars - old, wise peopleEven though ELS comprises stars in various evolutionary phases, in most cases the emission arises from the equatorial circumstellar disc which is made of gas and dust. The formation mechanism of circumstellar disc varies between different classes. For example, in PMS stars the circumstellar disc is the accretion disc through which material is added to the star from its surroundings. In Classical Be stars, the disc is formed due to rapid spinning of the star which pushes away material from the star to its surroundings. So it should be noted that even though we put stars with emission lines into a single category of ELS, they are very different from each other. Hence, we need to classify them based on their photometric properties. Aim:: As large-scale spectroscopic surveys collect a large number of spectra every night, we need to identify special classes of stars such as ELS and classify them into different categories for the research community to study various emission mechanisms. This is the motivation for the work titled “Discovery of 2716 hot emission-line stars from LAMOST DR5’’. Data:: The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) is a multi-object telescope that can observe around 4000 stars in one night. By its 5th data release (DR5), it had accumulated around 9 million spectra from 2011-2017 which are available to the community. We made use of this huge database to increase the number of ELS stars known to us. One interesting fact about LAMOST is that the majority of observed stars are in the Galactic anticenter direction. This is particularly important because the earlier studies which have identified ELS have not looked into this direction of the sky. So this opened up an opportunity to study ELS in previously less explored parts of the sky. Analysis:: In this work, we took O, B and A type stars (Teff ranging from 30000 K to 10000 K) from the LAMOST DR5 database (for an explanation of different spectral types, look into Anusha R’s CAe article). We restricted ourselves to these spectral types because the main aim of this was to identify new Classical Be/Ae and Herbig Be/Ae stars. Once we removed bad quality (Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) &lt; 10)1 spectra from our list, we used an open-source python package called ‘scipy. signal’ to identify emission peaks. The entire definition of ELS rests on the presence of one of the most commonly found emission line, Hα at 6563 Å. We searched and picked out spectra with the Hα line anywhere between 6561 Å and 6568 Å. This range was selected to take into effect the instrumental calibration defect (if any) and the doppler shift that may be seen in a few stars. We identified 4138 spectra that belong to 3339 unique ELS stars from our analysis. To classify stars into different categories such as CBeAe or HBeAe, we need an accurate spectral type for each spectrum. The LAMOST automated pipeline does provide a spectral type for each spectrum which did not turn out to be accurate due to the presence of emission lines. This introduced the necessity for us to re-estimate spectral type for each spectrum. We followed a technique called template matching. We made use of the MILES stellar spectral library for this purpose. For each spectrum, we matched the templates from MILES library to our target spectrum and identified the best fit. Then the spectral type of the best fit template was assigned to the target spectrum. In order to differentiate between Classical Be/Ae and Herbig Be/Ae stars, we made use of the inherent difference between them known as Infrared (IR) excess. Herbig Be/Ae stars, being young stars, have lots of gas and dust around them in addition to a circumstellar disc. This extra gas and dust reprocesses the energy from the star and emits them in infrared wavelengths. Due to this, the HAeBe stars are brighter in IR wavelengths than CBe stars. Hence we use the photometric data2 available to us to differentiate them based on colors and spectral indices. The breakup of various classes identified in this work is given in the table below.    Table 1: Statistical break-up of various classes identified in this work. Image source:Table 1 of the review paper) . We visually examined the Hα line features belonging to each class and reported their statistics. Finally, a representative spectrum of major classes is presented in Figure 3.   Figure 3: This plot shows a representative spectrum belonging to each of Oe*, CBe, CAe, HBe, HAe, B[em], and A[em] classes. Red dotted lines denote [NII] lines at 6548 and 6584 ̊A and green solid lines denote [SII] lines at 6717 and 6731 ̊A. The spectra are normalized using laspec open source python package. Image source: Figure 7 of the review paper . Future Scope:: This research work identifies new ELS stars from a large database and classifies them into various categories based on their photometric properties. As the data collection capabilities increase day-to-day, the need for such works increases. We have multiple follow-up works in the fray which uses the LAMOST database effectively in identifying and study the properties of CBeAe and HAeBe stars in more detail.

    "body": "2022/03/14 - As part of the National Science day celebrations, the Indian Institute of Astrophysics organised a panel discussion titled- Bengaluru The Astronomy City. The focus of the meeting was to educate the young students regarding various opportunities in astronomy and astrophysics at all educational levels. A total of 10 institutions located in Bengaluru took part in the event namely:  Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS) Raman Research Institute (RRI) Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Indian Institute of Science (IISc) CHRIST (Deemed to by University) St. Joseph’s College Bangalore Astronomical Society (BAS) Association of Bangalore Amateur Astronomers (ABAA) JawaharLal Nehru Planetarium (JNP)These institutes include core research institutes (1-4), Universities (5-7), amateur organizations (8-9) and a planetarium (10) involved in astronomy research and outreach. The panel consisted of a diverse group of individuals which included Ph. D. students, postdoctoral fellows, senior faculty members as well as amateur astronomers. The representatives introduced themselves, about their career paths and how they reached their current positions. Niruj Mohan Ramanujam from IIA started the event with an introduction to the panel.   The participants of the discussion panel. Image courtesy: author. After the introductions were over, Sonali Sachdeva from RRI gave a presentation covering opportunities for students as well as interested minds at almost all educational levels. The initial slides focussed on the opportunities in astronomy for school students. For instance, the following opportunities were presented for school students:  Public talks especially for school students which are regularly organized by all participant organisations Schools can invite a scientist to interact with the students (ICTS) Science workshops for students and teachers (JNP) Science Education in Early Development (SEED) Summer Program for students (JNP) Science Over Weekends (SOW) for high school students (JNP) Maths Circle (ICTS) Outreach programs for govt schools in North Bengaluru (ICTS) Young Scientist Program (ISRO)After the opportunities available to school students, the subsequent slides presented opportunities for students at the college level. The opportunities at the BSc and MSc levels were presented in detail. All the participating institutes provided information regarding short or long term research projects under the guidance of their faculty members. The complete information is available in the video. The next part of the discussion focused on the opportunities for prospective Ph. D. students.  Bengaluru probably has the highest number of astronomy Ph. D. students in the country. All the participant research institutes and universities offer Ph. D. programs for students from both science and engineering backgrounds. Students are admitted through national eligibility tests such as GATE/JEST/NET and/or through their own entrance exams, followed by an interview. These researchers can also carry out their research in collaboration with multiple universities/institutes. Information about the opportunities for amateur astronomers was provided by representatives from ABAA and BAS, organizations which have been educating Bengalurians about astronomy and astronomical events for a long time. JNP offers a variety of programs and workshops for people from all backgrounds and expertise. These programs have been attracting thousands of students every year for more than three decades. So far, over 135 students who have benefitted from these programs have taken up astronomy research as their career. The presentation was followed by a discussion session which was quite lively and people asked a wide variety of questions such as the opportunities for primary school children, visits of students to the research laboratories, teacher training opportunities, and support for astronomy clubs in schools. For a lot of questions, the panelists provided their perspectives which provided comprehensive answers to these questions. Further, information regarding new opportunities was provided by the institutions such as ISRO which has launched the ‘Young Scientist Program’. Representatives from IIA provided detailed information about Engineering or astronomy-based projects for the upcoming 30m telescope. Students were provided detailed information about how to apply for research projects at these research institutes. Information about summer programs and internships for MSc/engineering students in all the institutes were also discussed. The links provided at the end of the article provide comprehensive information about these opportunities. From the vibrant discussion, it is evident that Bengalurians are a curious lot when it comes to research happening in Astronomy. It was noticeably observed that parents are particularly interested in exposing their kids to astronomy and science in general from a very young age. The panelists were also excited to share more of their work. This discussion indeed seems like the first step towards the combined efforts of all these institutions coming together to take astronomy to the Bengaluru people. We hope for many more such efforts to follow in the future.

    "title": "Understanding the evolution of the binary star system ‘Cen X-3’: New measurements of the spin and orbital parameters of the system ",
    "body": "2022/03/06 -  Researchers from Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, present the new measurements of the spin and orbital parameters of the binary star system ‘Cen X-3’. This work is a step forward in understanding the complex dynamics of the binary star systems and their evolution.  ‘Cen X-3’ is a binary star system observed in the constellation ‘Centaurus’. It is one of the most luminous X-ray sources in our galaxy and the first-ever X-ray pulsar to be discovered. Scientists from the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune present the new measurements of spin and orbital parameters of ‘Cen X-3’. The results are crucial in understanding the life-cycle and evolution of X-ray binary systems. The work is published in the ‘Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy on AstroSat: Five Years in Orbit’. Researchers used the data from the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters (LAXPCs) onboard Astrosat, for the analysis. Astrosat is India’s first dedicated multi-wavelength space telescope launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 2015. Cen X-3 is a two-star system consisting of a pulsar, a highly magnetized neutron star beaming X-rays, and a companion star. The neutron star is an extremely compact object; as massive as our sun but only a few kilometers across in size! The neutron star in Cen X-3 gravitationally accretes matter from its companion star. The kinetic energy of the infalling matter is converted to other forms of energy including electromagnetic radiation. The neutron star’s magnetic field dictates the accretion flow inside the magnetosphere. The accreting matter is channeled along the magnetic field lines and onto the magnetic poles forming an accretion column. The neutron star’s rotational axis is not necessarily aligned with its magnetic axis. Such misalignment gives rise to highly periodic pulsations hence the name ‘pulsars’.  Figure 1: Illustration of an accretion-powered pulsar. The magnetic axis sweeps earth in every rotation of the neutron star due to misalignment between the rotational axis and the magnetic axis giving rise to highly periodic pulsations. The image used here is available at this URL. Both stars are gravitationally bound and revolve around each other. The binary orbit can evolve due to matter exchange between the stars, mass loss from the binary system, and due to tidal interaction between the two stars. Studying the evolution of the orbit of such systems is important in understanding stellar structure and evolution. The results of these studies can be a direct test for stellar structure models and evolution theories. The first step in doing such a study is to determine the binary orbit.  Figure 2: Determination of a binary orbit from the doppler shift (NS: Neutron Star), Image courtesy: Author In systems like Cen X-3, the companion star is almost 10-15 times heavier than the neutron star. Thus the center of mass of the binary system is much closer to the center of the companion star than the neutron star. In such cases, one can visualize the binary orbit, as illustrated in figure 2 where the neutron star is orbiting around the companion star.  Due to its motion in the binary orbit, the neutron star moves back and forth along the line of sight. The observed frequency of the pulses from the neutron star is shifted due to this motion owing to the phenomenon called the ‘Doppler effect’. Due to this effect, when the neutron star is moving towards the observer, the pulses arrive faster and when the neutron star is moving away from the observer, the pulses are delayed as shown in figure 2. This results in a periodic variation with time in the observed pulse frequency. The rate of this variation corresponds to the orbital period of the system. For a perfectly circular orbit, the pulse frequency variation is sinusoidal. The deviation from the sinusoidal behavior is indicative of the eccentricity in the orbit. Eccentricity is a measure of how elongated the orbit is. The eccentricity of a perfectly circular orbit is zero. The higher the eccentricity, the more elongated the orbit. The binary orbit can be determined completely from this. For a system with a nearly circular orbit like Cen X-3, parameters that can describe the system dynamics completely are:  Neutron star spin period and its rate of change Period of the binary orbit and its rate of change Orbital velocity and radius EccentricityThe evolution of the orbit can be understood by comparing the orbital parameters at various instances of time. Parisee Shirke (IUCAA, Pune) and the team found that the spin period of the neutron star has reduced to 4. 80s from 4. 81s. This means that the neutron star is spinning up which is as per its known behavior. However, the rate at which the neutron star is spinning up has halved. This can be due to variation in the rate of matter accretion from the companion star. The orbital period was found to be around 2. 03 days. The rate of change of the orbital period was observed to be substantially large compared to the previously reported values. The authors state that this could be due to short time-scale variations in the orbital period. The orbital velocity is measured to be around 410 Km/s which agrees with the previous measurements. The projected radius of the orbit has decreased from 39. 66 lt-s to 38. 23 lt-s. This change is in accordance with the observed orbital decay in Cen X-3. The binary orbit is observed to be nearly circular with a very small eccentricity. This work is a step forward in understanding the complex dynamics of the binary star systems and their evolution.

    "title": "Sir C. V. Raman: Raman effect and beyond",
    "body": "2022/02/28 -  We Indians celebrate National Science Day on 28th February each year to mark the discovery of the Raman effect by Sir C. V. Raman. Some of Raman’s discoveries like the Raman effect (for which he was awarded the Nobel prize), Raman-Nath theory, his studies on Brillouin scattering, the soft mode process, etc. are so well known and outstanding, that they tend to overshadow many of his other elegant and significant contributions to the science. We attempt to highlight a few of Raman’s discoveries such that they portray a more complete picture of Sir C. V. Raman and his contributions.    Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman(7 November 1888 - 21 November 1970) Sir C. V. Raman occupies a very special place in the scientific landscape of India. His contributions to science were monumental both in scale and scope. He also played a pivotal role in shaping Indian science institutions and redefined the way in which science was done in India. Max Born, a nobel prize winning german scientist who was instrumental in the development of the quantum mechanics, had this to say about Raman, “There is no Indian physicist of the rank of Raman. No man can compare with him in vigor or intensity. ” The curious case of a relentless experimentalist: It was the year 1921. You could find a turbaned Indian man on a ship returning from Europe to India, running all around, with his nicol prisms and cardboard tubes, collecting sea water from the depths of the ocean. The visual beauty of the Mediterranean ocean had bewitched him. Not so long ago, Lord Rayleigh had shown that the blue color of the sky is due to scattering of light by air molecules. However, according to Lord Rayleigh, the blue color of the deep ocean was due to reflection of the sky in the water. Raman showed, by a simple experiment he performed on board the ship, that the blue color of the ocean is due to molecular scattering and not just due to the reflection of the sky. He quenched the sky’s reflection with a nicol prism at the Brewster angle and found that the blue color “far from being impoverished by suppression of the sky reflection was wonderfully improved thereby”. In 1922, he wrote the celebrated monograph “Molecular Diffraction of Light” and so began the saga of a single-minded man pursuing his vision with a stamina and persistence never seen before, which eventually lead to the discovery of the Raman effect and many other outstanding contributions. Weak Fluorescence: In April 1923, KR Ramanathan, one of Raman’s students, studied the scattering of light in water. Sunlight was focussed on the liquid and the scattered light was observed through a system of complementary filters, each filter completely cutting off the light transmitted by the other. Nothing should have been observed if there had been no change of color during the scattering process. However, a track of scattered light could be observed showing there was indeed a change in the color of light during scattering. This was attributed to a “weak fluorescence” due to impurities which were believed to be present. Raman was not convinced with this explanation though. This “weak fluorescence” was not completely depolarised (as true fluorescence should have been) and the amount of depolarisation changed with wavelength. THE RAMAN EFFECT:  Sir C. V. Raman with the spectrograph (Top) and the first Raman spectra photographed (Bottom)  Newspaper announcements of the discovery of the Raman effect In December 1927, the so-called polarised “weak fluorescence” was observed again by S Venkateswaran in pure glycerine with greater intensity. Due to limited availability of S Venkateswaran, Raman persuaded KS Krishnan, one of his brightest students, to set up experiments to find “weak fluorescence” in various materials. Raman and Krishnan worked together continuously and detected the polarized “weak fluorescence” in all the liquids, gasses and solids they examined. According to Krishan, Raman personally verified all the liquids exhibited this phenomenon. Raman was so excited about the discovery that he rushed to Krishan’s home at night to inform him that their observations were related to the Kramers-Heisenberg process they were looking for all these years. A note was sent to the Nature journal about the discovery. However, Raman continued his experiments, mostly by himself since the observed phenomenon was not yet fully understood. On February 28th 1928, Raman examined the scattered light with a direct vision spectroscope and found that the classical and modified scattering appear in the spectrum as separate regions with a distinct dark region between them, a clear demonstration of a change of wavelength in scattering. The Nobel Prize in Physics 1930 was awarded to Raman “for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the effect named after him. ”  Raman’s Nobel medal and citation Indian musical instruments and acoustics: Even before Raman started working on the scattering of Light, he was fascinated by waves… sound waves! Raman’s father, R Chandrasekhara Iyer was a teacher of Physics and Mathematics and a proficient violinist. That must have influenced him to take interest in the physics of sound waves. Raman himself played violin. At the age of 16, when he was a student of the Presidency college, Madras, Raman commenced his acoustic research.   Illustration of a Veena He investigated whether his intuition that the veena produces the most exquisite musical sound is due to sentiment or has a sound physical basis. The bridge of the veena is so cunningly constructed that the Helmholtz law, which states that the position at which the string is plucked cannot be a node, is violated. Thus this instrument produces innumerable harmonics making its sound closest in harmonic content to the human voice.   The mridangam and tabla produce a succession of musically harmonic overtones in the same way as any stringed instrument A sharp ear with a keen interest in music can detect musical overtones in the sound of the mridangam and the tabla. Raman discovered that the heterogeneous loading of their membranes can produce harmonics - so that in the hands of the masters, the Indian drum is similar to a stringed instrument. Diffraction of light by ultrasonic waves - Raman-Nath Theory: Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Young’s double slit experiment conclusively showed that the interference pattern can be obtained from interaction of light with matter. How about the interaction of light with matter waves!Raman-Nath theory explained a remarkable optical phenomenon that occurs when a parallel beam of light is diffracted by ultrasonic waves. In modern electro-optic instrumentation, the phenomenon of diffraction of light by ultrasonic waves is utilized in acousto-optic spectrometers, which analyze the electrical signal to obtain its power spectrum. Colors in Nature: Raman always had a huge fascination for colors. In the institute that he had built for himself after retirement (now Raman Research Institute), he started building his collection of colorful minerals gathered from all across the world. The collection includes limestones, marbles, alabaster, gypsums, tourmalines, agates, quartzites, jades, amethysts, fluorites, micas, serpentines, iolites, malachites, lapis lazuli and feldspars. Raman studied several of the exquisite optical phenomena displayed by these minerals. Due to lack of basic facilities during the initial days of his new institute, he had to mostly rely on the beam of sunlight to explore the optics of these substances. Even with such simple setups, it is remarkable that he could extract a substantial amount of information about these minerals.    Raman’s collection of minerals Birds are a delight to watch! Raman was very curious about the optical characteristic and the color distribution in birds, since it was so different in different parts of the same bird, in different specimens and in different species that no single explanation would suffice. He would invoke every known optics concept to try to explain these phenomena. He published only one paper on this topic; however talked about it a lot. The interest was not just limited to birds though. “Birds, Beetles and Butterflies” was his favorite title for the talk. He gave dozens of lectures on this subject, each one unique! Diamond: Soon after the discovery of the Raman effect, C Ramaswamy, Raman’s younger brother, asked him to suggest a research problem which he could pursue. Seeing the diamond ring of the newly wed Ramaswamy sported on his finger, Raman suggested the study of scattering in diamond. The famous 1332 cm-1 Raman line of diamond was discovered in the spectrum. Using a 140-carat diamond that was borrowed from the Maharaja of Darbhanga, Bhagavantam, one of Raman’s pupils confirmed this result and also recorded the complex luminescence spectrum around 4152 Å. Raman says this about diamonds, “With their perfect geometric forms and their smooth lustrous beauty they look absolutely fresh from nature’s crucible, although actually taken from sedimentary formations a thousand million years old. The strongly marked curvature of the crystal faces and the smoothly rounded edges are a surprising feature of these crystals”  Sir C. V. Raman with beloved diamond In continuation with his work on diamonds, he also carried out pioneering studies of the thermo-optic behavior of other solids, their photo-elastic and magneto-optic properties, fluorescence, second order Raman effect, infrared spectroscopy, etc. It is perhaps not well known that X-ray topography was discovered in this laboratory while studying the imperfections in diamond. He also worked on lattice dynamics, visual perception and many more topics and made contributions in those areas. It is almost impossible to give a complete description of his diverse research interests and achievements in a single article. More elaborate descriptions about the scientific works of Raman can be found in “C. V. Raman : A pictorial biography” a compilation by S Ramaseshan and C Ramachandra Rao. Pioneer of scientific research in India: Throughout his career, Raman played an integral role in the development of the Institutes that he was part of. During the early 1900s, most of the Indian universities were teaching universities. There was a general belief that new science can not grow in the country and all the young bright minds were sent abroad for ‘training’. Raman, setting his own example, cultivated the culture of scientific research in India. He made an active effort to bring the best minds in the world, like Max Born, Schrodinger, Ewald, Peierls, Kuhn and many more to India. He thought, bringing such great minds could start a scientific movement in the country. Unfortunately, only Max Born could accept his invitation. Raman founded the Indian Academy of sciences in 1934 with the main objective of promoting progress and upholding the cause of science. Central to this mission was to publish scientific monographs and journals through which research discoveries could be disseminated worldwide. The proceedings of the Indian Academy of sciences was considered as one of the top journals up until the 1950s. The annual meetings of the academy, so called ‘traveling circus’, were the main source of science encouragement in the country, with Raman usually being the star performer. Today, the academy publishes twelve journals in different areas of science and science education, in addition to more than fifty books that have been published over the years.

    "title": "Understanding the solar chromosphere through spectral lines",
    "body": "2022/02/27 -  This article takes the reader through a journey of inferring the cosmos - specifically our dear neighbour Sun - through various properties of light. The journey meanders through our work on understanding solar chromospheric properties through spectral lines, and seems to cluminate in the sea of questions raised by our work!  Light is one of the most fundamental, complex and inherently mind blowing things to exist in this world. Every culture across the globe attributes (or attributed) great significance to light, while adding multiple layers of symbolism and meaning. Light has its influence right from the chloroplasts in plants converting water &amp; nutrients to sugar and Oxygen, to the largest of solar panels to generate electricity for entire cities. Light is, in some sense, our window to this world. The same is true for astronomers. Imagine an astronomer working - I am pretty sure your immediate thought is a person looking through a telescope in the night sky. Well, you are pretty correct - in that most information about the universe comes to us through light! But light is not just what we see: the radio frequency on which mobile phones operate is light, and so are the X-rays which are used to check for bone fractures. What kind of light exists depends on how it is generated in the first place. The simplest way to make light is to get objects hot. A hot iron rod glows red, while an arc welding plasma glows blue. Heat, and temperature are primary drivers of what kind of light comes out. This colour of light is given by the wavelength (or the frequency) of light. The larger this frequency of light, smaller the wavelength is, and more the energy in light. X rays have a very short wavelength (and so high energy), while Radio waves have a very long wavelength (and low energy). Similarly, red light has a larger wavelength than blue (or violet) light. So, in general, hotter objects have more energy, and hence emit more in short wavelengths, while cooler objects have lesser energy, and emit more in longer wavelengths. This is the reason why X-rays are generally much more harmful than Radio waves1. The Sun we see every day is obviously a hot object. So logically, we also expect it to give light corresponding to how hot it is. And this is quite true – the solar surface or the solar disc we see in the sky is at 5500 Kelvin. Hence, it emits most of its energy near greenish-yellow light2. But all parts of the Sun do not preferentially emit this greenish-yellow light – rather, depending on the temperature, different parts of the Sun emit in different colours. In Fig. 1 below, I have displayed the same region of the Sun as seen in different wavelengths. The hottest plasma is seen in the 94 Å image, while the coolest is seen in the 2796 Å image - with temperature (approximately) reducing with increasing wavelength. Each structure contains material at different temperatures - this is because different structures form at different heights! A general rule of thumb in the solar atmosphere is “hotter stuff forms at greater height than cooler stuff”3, so the S shaped loop in the 94 Å image forms much higher than the structure in the 2796 Å image.   Fig. 1: A solar flare as seen in different wavelengths (listed on top of each panel). Shorter wavelengths mean more energy. From 94 &Aring; to 2796 &Aring;, as temperature reduces, different structures in the solar atmosphere are clearly seen, from S shaped loops to longer loops to finally a dark sunspot-like patch from 1600 &Aring; onwards! Images assembled from AIA data (corona) and Slit-Jaw Imager (chromosphere).  This is just one aspect of the light that comes to us. The other aspect is that the material which emits this light, also leaves an imprint on “how bright” the light is at different wavelengths. This is slightly different from the Thermal radiation, which depends only on the temperature. The typical brightness at every wavelength for light coming due to an object being hot, looks somewhat like the top row in Fig. 2. Here, notice that the brightness shows some variation with wavelength (which, I remind you, is given by the colour of light) - but the essential point is that every wavelength has some amount of brightness. Now, check out the second row - corresponding to a Sodium atom. You will see that the brightness is present at discrete locations in wavelength, and most of the wavelengths have no brightness. This is in stark contrast to the thermal radiation, and is followed similarly by all other elements listed in the rows below Sodium. But note that the pattern, or location &amp; brightness of these spectral lines of different elements is unique for each element. In a sense, spectral lines can be thought of as a fingerprint of atoms and molecules. Just like each human has a unique set of fingerprints, similarly each atom or molecule has a specific set of spectral lines as its signature. These lines you see are bright in specific wavelengths, and are called emission lines.   Fig. 2: Examples of many spectrum (=spectra). On the bottom most axis, the wavelength increases from 4000 &Aring; (left) to more than 7000 &Aring; (right). The top row shows what is called a continuous spectrum, which depends only on the temperature of the object. Each subsequent row shows how much bright light is in each wavelength, for different atoms listed to the left. Image source: OpenStax . Astronomers study the spectral lines of different objects like stars, galaxies, etc, and try to figure out which all atoms, ions and molecules are present in the object of study. Remember, what I have shown in Fig. 2 is the light coming from one vertical slit - that is why, the spectral lines are all seen as vertical lines. But this need not be the case - I can also look at approximately one point on the Sun (or even average over the vertical line), for example, and get its spectrum out. This exercise will give us a result similar to Fig. 3, where we just have the brightness of light for every wavelength. This is the kind of spectrum astronomers generally analyze.   Fig. 3: The intensity of various spectral lines as a function of wavelength. Taken from CHIANTI.  A side note here: The spectrum shown Fig. 3 is the brightness (or rather the intensity) for every wavelength. We can then construct a similar spectrum for a large region of the Sun, and obtain such spectra for each point. Now, if we consider the intensity at, let’s say 2796 Å for each point, we will get an image similar to the last panel in Fig. 1. How cool is that!4 You will now have many questions: why is the spectrum of individual elements only at specific wavelengths, and not everywhere? What conditions give rise to the brightness of these lines? First off, you find the spectrum of elements at discrete wavelength locations because these arise from atomic transitions between two approximately fixed energy levels. The quantum of Quantum mechanics gives rise to this discrete nature5. Next, the spectrum itself depends on, among other parameters, 4 critical properties: the temperature of the region where the spectrum is generated, density of the material giving rise to the spectrum, velocity of this material, and turbulence6. These properties, under certain circumstances, can be easily inferred from just the spectrum of an atom. First off, note that the material which emits this light is a fluid (more precisely, plasma) in our case. Hence, the temperature and density of the plasma determine if a given spectral line will even form. So just knowing the fact that a given line is seen tells us the possible range of values temperature and quantity can take. Next, the brightness of the line is in most cases dominated by the density of plasma – more density, more brightness, but you do have the effect of atomic physics and temperature. Third, the wavelength where we expect the line brightness to peak can be shifted to different wavelengths too! This is called Doppler shift. If the plasma is moving towards us, the shift is toward shorter wavelengths (called Blueshift), and if the plasma is moving away from us, the shift is toward longer wavelengths (called Redshifts)7.  Finally, if you see in Fig. 3, the line does not immediately peak at one wavelength. Rather, it starts to increase from one wavelength, reaches a maximum, and then reduces. This is called the line width, and is determined by the temperature, and turbulence in the plasma. Turbulence basically is a measure of how much fluctuation of different spatial sizes is present in the fluid - it is yet another measure of what the plasma we consider is like. So TLDR in summary, using spectral lines, we can get an estimate of local temperature, velocity, density and turbulence of these plasma parcels through spectral lines. So what is the big idea? The big idea is that some specific regions on the Sun are thought to give rise to a stream of particles called the solar wind. We know that these regions are important, but we don’t know at what height the solar wind starts to form. Now, the solar wind is basically a stream of particles coming out of the Sun. So if you are looking “down” on the Sun, you will see that the particles are coming towards you. This means the spectral line which the particles emit will be blueshifted. So the basic idea is that we study these Doppler shifts for plasma which correspond to different wavelengths (and so different heights and temperatures, like Fig. 1), and see where the blueshifts start! Now, these regions, which are thought to give rise to the solar wind, are called Coronal holes (CHs) - because they are seen as dark patches in the solar corona. In Fig. 4b below, all dark regions belong to CHs, while the brighter regions belong to Quiet Sun8 (QS). These regions appear very different in the solar corona. However, if we check what these regions look like at lower heights called the chromosphere, the differences are reduced (see Fig. 4a)! Why so? Has this “vanishing” of difference got anything to do with the solar wind? Can we do specific studies of these regions, and figure out what causes these differences? Are they dependent on the underlying magnetic field in any way? This was our primary objective of study. At this juncture, I should tell you that scientists have done extensive studies of the CHs and QS regions in the corona, and all of the information I have presented in the last two or so paragraphs was generated in the last three decades. So we do stand on the shoulders of other giants – while we do bring our own thought process to the table!  Fig. 4: An image of the CHs and surrounding QS region in the upper chromosphere (left panel) and the corona (right panel). The green lines demarcate CHs from QS in both the figures. Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2021 . Back to our work: we studied one spectral line (yep, just one line, and you will see how much information we can infer from it!), and its properties across both the CHs and QS regions. This line forms due to a transition of the C+ ion (called CII by astrophysicists) at a wavelength of 1334 Å. How do we know the correct wavelength? We can perform controlled experiments in labs on Earth and figure it out. Now, you have already seen how there is not a great difference between CH and QS in the intensity image of Fig. 4a. Similar results hold if we look at what the plasma velocity and line width are in Fig. 5. This tells us that if I were to not tell you where the CH and QS regions are, you cannot figure them out from either the intensity, velocity, or the width of the C II line. Thus, on a gross scale, the CH and QS are very similar! Interesting things happen if we account for the underlying magnetic field. How do we do this? We ask: what is the intensity in CH and QS at similar magnetic field strengths? Similarly, what are the velocities and line widths? The underlying magnetic field strength9 might be similar, but the structure of the magnetic field can be different! The structure of magnetic field (a. k. a magnetic topology) is important, because we know that the CHs are regions where the magnetic field comes out predominantly in open lines10, while in QS the same magnetic field comes as short closed loops. These differences are seen clearly in the corona – but are they also seen in the chromosphere?  Fig. 5: Velocity (left) and line width (right) of the C II line in CH and QS. The positive velocity is called “redshift” and tells how fast plasma is moving away from us, while the negative velocity is called “blueshift”, and tells how fast plasma is moving towards us. The larger line width means the line is broader, indicating larger turbulence effects and some non trivial effects. Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2021. Turns out it is the case! We can indeed differentiate between CH and QS if we consider regions with similar magnetic field strength. In Fig. 6, the black dots correspond to the average of quantity in Y-axis (Intensity, velocity, width) for regions with similar magnetic field strength (in X-axis). On an average, you see that the QS intensity is larger than the CH intensity in Fig. 6a – reminiscent of the differences in the corona, and seen statistically here. So one question is answered: CHs and QS are already differentiated in the chromosphere, but you can see this only statistically!11 Next, look at panel (b) of the same figure. The velocity is mostly positive - indicating plasma moving away from us, and down towards the photosphere. Thus, the chromosphere is, on average, flowing downwards into the Sun. However, it is interesting to see that at 40 Gauss, a switchover occurs: for less field strength, the QS has plasma flowing down faster, while it is CH for larger field strength. This is counter intuitive – if the solar wind comes out and towards us in the CH, why is plasma moving away from us in CH? Finally, see panel (c) of the same figure. The line width is seen to increase with field strength. This tells us that the profiles are getting broader, possibly implying larger turbulence with increasing field strength. Here too, CHs are broader than QS for large field strengths!  Fig. 6: Different properties of CH (black) and QS (orange) as a function of magnetic field strength (|B|). Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2021. Things don’t stop here. The velocity panel in Fig. 6b raises many questions. And so, we repeat the analysis with a tweak - this time, we consider the blueshifts and redshifts separately. Why so? This is important to understand if the field strength has preferentially some effect on the blueshifts and redshifts, which get averaged out in Fig. 6b. And so, we check what the speeds look like in Fig. 7. In panel (a) of Fig. 7, the CHs have larger blueshifts over QS, telling us plasma is indeed preferentially moving towards us in the CHs. Thus, in principle, these blueshifts could be a signature of the solar wind. Now we are in business! In panel (b), we check what the downflows look like. It seems for regions with large field strength, plasma is flowing into the Sun faster in CHs over QS. This was the signature which confused us in Fig. 6b. Why does the CH, which is understood to be a source of particles coming out towards the Earth, have particles going into the Sun, and away from the Earth preferentially? Are we doing something wrong? Or are the spectral profiles, and thus the process which generates these lines different in CHs and QS? Turns out it is not the case. I will not show the plot here (already there is an overdose of information – too much of a good thing is also not good! :P), but we find that the spectral profiles are very similar in both CH and QS. Thus, it tells us that the processes which give rise to these profiles are similar in both the regions – the differences are coming out only because of the differences in the magnetic field topology of CHs and QS!  Fig. 7: The velocity variation with magnetic field strength, for regions with only upflows (left) and only downflows (right) for CHs (black) and QS (orange). Image source: Vishal. U et al. , 2021 . Thus, through this work, we find that the CHs and QS might appear similar overall, but the differentiation in chromosphere is seen clearly if we consider regions with similar magnetic field strength. This differentiation is seen clearly as less intensity and excess line width in CHs over QS. The differentiation is clearly seen to arise primarily due to the magnetic field topology, and not due to fundamental differences in the way these lines form. However, our work poses a bunch of fundamental questions: Why is plasma flowing faster away from us in CHs over QS, when these CHs are supposed to be the sources of solar wind? Does this “redshift” bear any relation to the solar wind? How do these results tie up with analysis done for lines which form at higher temperatures (and hence, in the transition region &amp; corona), and lower temperatures (lower &amp; mid chromosphere)? And do the blueshifts we find in Fig. 7b have any relation with the solar wind? To know more, and understand what happens next, keep watching this space!

    "title": "Astrobiology: Exploring the universe for signs of extra-terrestrial life",
    "body": "2022/02/20 -  The only life forms we know about are the ones that exist on Earth. Due to advancements in space exploration, it has become possible to send rovers, probes, space crafts, and telescopes in further deep space. With the help of these space missions and various other tools, astrobiologists are trying to find signatures of life on other planets, exoplanets, and various moons.  1. 	Introduction: Is life a cosmic phenomenon?Are we alone in the universe? All of us have wondered about it at some point in our lives. Perhaps only a few would have wondered about what exactly is life. This might sound philosophical at first but it is equally scientific. Astrobiology tries to find answers to all these questions. It is the science that seeks to understand the story of life in the universe. We have not found explicit evidence of life so far but with unceasing curiosity and an inherent urge for exploration, scientists have discovered a lot. Being a multidisciplinary field, Astrobiology brings people with diverse backgrounds together to achieve a common goal – the search for life beyond Earth and beyond the solar system. The origin of life on Earth is a great mystery and therefore scientists are investigating the problem in several different ways.  Some are studying life on our own planet. Some are seeking out life or fossil life on other planets or moons in our solar system. Others are trying to detect life in other solar systems, either by measuring life’s effects on the atmospheres of distant planets or by measuring artificial radiation like radio signals that may be produced by advanced life. 2. 	Life on Earth: We only know the nature of life as it exists on Earth. It is built around compounds that contain elements such as carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen. Complex sequences of these elements bond together, forming the very building blocks of life. They form essential organic molecules, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). However, these organic molecules did not naturally exist on Earth during the Hadean eon (4. 0 billion years ago and preceding the existence life forms). The elements required existed only in inorganic form, bound up within the rocks, atmosphere and the early ocean. It is estimated that life on Earth began at least 3. 5 billion years ago, because that is the age of the oldest rocks with fossil evidence of life on Earth. Researchers suggest that in order to understand how life began on Earth, we need to understand the specific environmental conditions and other requirements that must be satisfied to allow this to occur. What are the habitability requirements of known Earth life? The fundamental habitability requirements are certainly some of the commonalities of life on Earth. •	Energy:A source of energy is necessary for metabolism and to maintain the functions carried out by a cell. Life on Earth uses either solar energy or chemical energy sources that include both organic (carbon) compounds and inorganic elements and molecules. •	Common essential elements:All known Earth life uses the same main set of elements to form biomolecules (CHNOPS) and shares a common carbon-based biochemistry. Carbon is an excellent element from which to build life, because carbon forms macromolecules with a variety of other elements and itself. Carbon forms primarily covalent bonds (compared to ionic bonds), and carbon-based molecules are stable in the presence of water and oxygen. •	Solvent:A solvent to host chemical interactions is considered a universal requirement for all life. With extensive evidence that all Earth life needs water specifically as the solvent, many astrobiologists consider water to be the most probable solvent for life. When considering whether an environment or planet is habitable, at a minimum, scientists take into account the potential energy source (or sources), the ambient chemical composition and whether this composition is suitable to build biomass, and the availability of a solvent. Additionally, there are physical constraints upon life (e. g. , temperature, pressure, pH, salinity, radiation, metal toxicity) such that the presence of these habitability requirements may be necessary but not sufficient for life. 2. 1 Life on Earth is divided into three domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya (or Eucarya); Single-celled organisms are common in all three domains, and all organisms in the domains Archaea and Bacteria are single-celled. All multicellular organisms fall within the domain Eukarya. The term ‘‘prokaryotes’’ has traditionally been used to describe single-celled organisms that do not contain a nucleus, organelles, or a cytoskeleton (collectively, the domains Bacteria and Archaea). The majority of life on Earth is microbial, and astrobiologists extrapolate from that fact to conclude that the majority of any extraterrestrial life that may possibly exist is also likely to be microbial. Archaea and Bacteria are the focus of astrobiological studies due to the diversity of metabolic strategies utilized by them and their ability to thrive in extreme habitats, their pivotal role in Earth’s biogeochemical cycling, and the fact that single-celled organisms dominated the early history of life on Earth. Bacteria and Archaea harbour the vast majority of the genetic diversity of life on Earth. Scientists estimate that, to date, less than 1% of microbial life has been successfully cultivated (e. g. , grown in the laboratory). Therefore, molecular methods that do not require cultivation are also used to detect the presence and genetic capabilities of microbes through DNA (metagenomics), RNA and gene expression activity (metatranscriptomics), and transcribed proteins (metaproteomics). These techniques have demonstrated that microbial populations are highly complex and that we have only begun to elucidate the full extent and capabilities of microbial life.   Image 1: A phylogenetic tree based on rRNA data, emphasizing the separation of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, as proposed by Carl Woese, George E. Fox et al. in 1990. Image source: Carl Woese et al. (1990) 2. 2 Prevalence of life in extreme environments: When space agencies first began to explore the Solar System, scientists were not sure what they would find on the surfaces of planets like Mars and Venus. When space missions revealed Mars to be a frigid desert, and Venus a boiling cauldron, void of any obvious signs of life, astrobiologists began to wonder… what are the limits of habitability for life as we know it? How hot is too hot? How cold is too cold? How much acid can cells handle, and how little water can life survive on? Answering questions like these opened an entire field of study known as extremophile research, where scientists examine the adaptations of organisms in conditions that are considered ‘extreme’ for life on Earth. These hardy lifeforms can help us better understand how life as we know it might originate, evolve, and reproduce in harsh environments in the Solar System and beyond. On a tour of extreme environments on Earth, a good place to start is with terrestrial hot springs. Good examples include Yellowstone National park in the United States, Rotorua in New Zealand and Puga hot spring in Ladakh, India These environments were the first to draw the interest of astrobiologists that study the limits of life on Earth, and they are arguably the first environment in which an extremophile, Thermus aquaticus was isolated and documented by scientists.   Image 2: Aerial view of Grand Prismatic Spring; Hot Springs, Midway &amp; Lower Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park. Image courtesy: Jim Peaco, National Park Service These springs are where geothermally heated water from underground rises to the planet’s surface. They can act as a source of water, energy, and nutrients for living cells. The water boiling up from below can carry a wide variety of minerals and reduced chemical species that certain microbes can use as a source of energy. Microorganisms have been found here living in pools of up to 206 degrees Fahrenheit (97ºC). The composition of the water depends on many different factors, such as its source and the types of rock and soil it travels through. It’s not just the heat that challenges life’s survival in hot springs. Some springs have water that is very acidic, others have water that is extremely alkaline. Gases at concentrations poisonous to humans, and other animals, bubble up with the water. The rock and liquid can contain heavy metals like arsenic and lead, along with lots of other minerals and particulates. Some pools can be extremely salty, and are rich in potassium and sulphate. High temperatures also mean less dissolved oxygen, so many hydrothermal pools are low in oxygen content. The multitude of harsh conditions present in terrestrial hot springs also means that it isn’t only thermophiles that live in these environments. There are acidophiles, alkaliphiles, and many other types of organisms. Sometimes scientists find extremophiles that use multiple adaptations to survive (polyextremophiles). On Earth, wherever we find liquid water, we find life, whether in bubbling hot springs, drops of brine inside ice, or films of water around minerals deep in the crust. Up until 1977, scientists believed that all life on Earth was in some way dependent upon sunlight for energy. The discovery of hydrothermal vents showed that life could thrive independent of the Sun. Suddenly, scientists had an Earthly example of how life might survive on ocean worlds in the outer Solar System, such as Jupiter’s moon Europa, or Saturn’s moon Enceladus. These moons are thought to harbor oceans of dark, liquid water beneath their icy surfaces. If hydrothermal vents are present, those oceans could be habitable for life as we know it. 2. 3	How do we search for signs of life beyond Earth? Astrobiological exploration is founded upon the premise that biosignatures encountered in space will be recognizable as presence of extraterrestrial life. A biosignature is any substance – such as an element, isotope, or molecule – or phenomenon that provides scientific evidence of past or present life. The usefulness of a biosignature is determined not only by the probability of life creating it but also by the improbability of non-biological (abiotic) processes producing it. Concluding that evidence of an extraterrestrial life form (past or present) has been discovered requires proving that a possible biosignature was produced by the activities or remains of life. As with most scientific discoveries, discovery of a biosignature will require evidence building up until no other explanation exists. Thus, we can look for atmospheric gases such as oxygen or methane that can be produced by life. Such planetary features that indicate life are biosignatures. The simultaneous presence of oxygen and methane is evidence for life because these two gases should quickly react with each other unless a biosphere is producing great amounts of them, which prevents equilibrium. Microbial life will readily consume hydrogen or carbon monoxide gas, so an abundance of either of these might be considered an anti-biosignature for a planet in the habitable zone. Eg. The presence of methane in the atmosphere of Mars is an area of ongoing research. Because of its tendency to be destroyed in the atmosphere by photochemistry, the presence of excess methane on a planet can be an indication that there must be an active source. With life being the strongest source of methane on Earth, observing a disequilibrium in the methane abundance on another planet could be a viable biosignature.   Image 3: This illustration portrays possible ways that methane might be added to Mars' atmosphere (sources) and removed from the atmosphere (sinks). NASA's Curiosity Mars rover has detected fluctuations in methane concentration in the atmosphere. Image courtesy: NASA/JPL-Caltech 3. 	Habitability in the solar system: After Earth it is absolutely logical to explore habitability of planets in our solar system. Planet Mars, in the inner solar system is a potential candidate to search for life beyond Earth. Simultaneously, moon of Jupiter (Europa) and moons of Saturn (Titan and Enceladus) in the outer solar system are also promising and extensive research is currently being conducted. The type of life that we are considering is simple, comparable to microbes, and the guiding principle concerns liquid water. 3. 1 Mars:Many have imagined Mars, unlike Venus, as a potential abode for life. The atmosphere of Mars is much thinner than Earth’s. The Red Planet’s atmosphere contains more than 95% carbon dioxide and much less than 1% oxygen. Temperatures on Mars average about -81 degrees F. However, temperature’s range from around -220 degrees F in the wintertime at the poles, to +70 degrees F over the lower latitudes in the summer. Mars Global Surveyor, which orbited from 1997 to 2006, mapped Mars and imaged sedimentary layers that implied many geologic cycles of erosion and deposition. In the early 21st century, the Mars Odyssey and Mars Express orbiters, along with Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, discovered areas of clay minerals and salts, which may have formed in liquid water. Twin Mars Exploration Rovers landed in 2004, and found fossilized ripples from past liquid water and sedimentary rocks, while in 2008, NASA’s Phoenix Lander dug up subsurface ice in a polar region and measured soluble salts in the soil. Finally, in 2012, Curiosity Rover trundled towards a 5-kilometre-high mountain of sedimentary beds within a 150- kilometre-diameter crater named Gale. It found mudstones deposited from water. Nowadays, astrobiological interest in Mars concerns either biological traces from billions of years ago or microbial-like life that might possibly endure in the subsurface or underground.   Image 4: Curiosity rover on a Martian sand dune. Image courtesy: NASA Mars’s current surface is hostile to life for three reasons. First, while ice exists for sure, no liquid water has been identified. The polar caps are water ice, topped with carbon dioxide ‘dry ice’ that grows when about 30 per cent of the atmosphere freezes at the winter pole. Also, above mid latitudes, ice cemented soil or permafrost lies just beneath the surface. In the tropics, afternoon temperatures in the top centimetre of soil rise above freezing, but there, ice turns to vapour before melting temperatures are reached. A second problem is no ozone layer, allowing harmful ultraviolet sunlight to reach the surface. Third, chemical reactions in the atmosphere make hydrogen peroxide— which settles to the surface, where they can destroy organics. While the surface is unpromising, geothermal heat underground might allow liquid water and life to exist. Evidence that liquid water used to be present suggests that Mars was once more habitable than today. Fluvial (stream-related) features in the landscape, including gullies, dried-up river valleys, deltas, and enormous channels are also indicative of the same. Moreover, the soil and rocks contain minerals that form in the presence of liquid water. 3. 2 Jovian moon Europa The Galileo mission detected an induced magnetic field in Europa (a moon of Jupiter), providing compelling evidence for an ocean of liquid water beneath the surface. While the top surface of Europa is not habitable, it is still relevant to discuss here for several reasons: (1) surface materials may reflect the chemistry of a subsurface ocean and help us understand the conditions available to life there, and (2) materials brought to the surface from the ocean below may be the only way we can detect signs of life (e. g. , organic matter or other biosignatures characterized spectroscopically on a future mission). Radiation from high-energy particles caught in Jupiter’s magnetic field causes oxidation of surface materials as the energy from radiation knocks electrons out of atoms. Radiolytically produced oxidants at the surface include O2, SO2, H2O2, and CO2. These may be subsequently cycled into the ice shell and ocean on timescales on the order of the age of the surface, 106 years, which is quite young on geological timescales, so these compounds could potentially oxidize more reduced chemical species in the ocean below.   Image5 : Europa, a jovian moon. Image courtesy: NASA 3. 3 Icy moons of Saturn : 3. 3. 1 Enceladus :Enceladus is Saturn’s sixth largest moon and has active geology. In 2005, the spacecraft Cassini started multiple close flybys of Enceladus, revealing its surface and environment in greater detail. It orbits Saturn in an elliptical fashion resulting in varying gravitational forces from Saturn that flex and heat Enceladus. For reasons that are not fully understood, the heating is concentrated under Enceladus’ South pole. There, icy particles and gas spray out of parallel fractures dubbed tiger stripes. The jets contain traces of methane, ammonia, and organic compounds, along with salt. Enceladus has a rocky core, an icy shell, and an underground sea beneath the area of the jets. The jackpot combination of organic molecules, energy, and liquid water implies that life might exist.   Image 6 : Narrow jets of gas and icy particles erupt from the south polar region of Enceladus, contributing to the moon's giant plume. A cycle of activity in these small-scale jets may be periodically lofting extra particles into space, causing the overall plume to brighten dramatically. Image courtesy: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute 3. 3. 2 Titan :Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, is also of astrobiological interest because it is the only satellite in the Solar System to have a thick atmosphere. In fact, the air pressure at Titan’s surface is 1. 5 bar, which is 50 per cent larger than that at the Earth’s surface. The atmosphere of 95 per cent nitrogen and 5 per cent methane provides a 10°C greenhouse effect, but the sunlight at Saturn’s distance is one hundred times less intense than at Earth, so Titan’s surface is incredibly cold at –179°C.   Image 7 : NASA's Cassini spacecraft sees bright methane clouds drifting in the summer skies of Saturn's moon Titan, along with dark hydrocarbon lakes and seas clustered around the north pole. Image courtesy: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute Titan’s atmosphere contains a smoggy haze of hydrocarbons. At high altitude, ultraviolet sunlight breaks up methane molecules (CH4) and subsequent reactions build up hydrocarbons including ethane (C2H6), acetylene (C2H2), propane (C3H8), benzene (C6H6), and reddish-brown particles containing polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The particles are called tholins. The products derived from methane sediment out of the atmosphere. In fact, about 20 per cent of Titan’s surface is covered in tropical dunes that are made of sand-sized particles, which are at least coated with organics if not made of them. At the poles, over 400 lakes are mixtures of liquid propane, ethane, and methane, with extraordinary beaches made of particles of benzene and acetylene. Methane on Titan behaves like water on Earth and forms clouds, rain, and rivers. Most of our knowledge about Titan comes from the Cassini–Huygens mission, which arrived in 2004. Huygens landed on Titan in 2005. Titan flexes too much to be entirely solid, which is evidence that Titan has a subsurface ocean which might exist below an icy crust. Two types of life might exist on Titan: Earth-like life in the subsurface ocean; and non-DNA based life or life which has a different biochemistry in the hydrocarbon lakes. 4. 	Habitability beyond solar system : Finding exoplanets is crucial before identifying a habitable one. With the vast distances involved, the search is difficult but nonetheless astronomers have developed two classes of methods. The first, indirect detection, looks for stellar properties, such as position or brightness, which are affected by the presence of unseen planets. The second is direct detection of a planet with an image or a spectrum of its light. For astrobiology, the most important techniques are direct detections that capture light from a planet. Direct detection is challenging because a planet is a dim body close to a vastly brighter star. Nonetheless, telescopes in space, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Telescopes and extremely large telescopes on the ground have accomplished direct detection using a coronagraph, which is a mask to block the starlight. With density measurements, there are increasing clues about which exoplanets are made of gas, rock, water, or some mixture. We care most about exoplanets with liquid water right at the surface. These have the chance of a biosphere that pumps lots of gases into an atmosphere. In principle, such biogenic gases are detectable in the light from the planet and might indicate life. If a planet is too far away from its host star it ices over, and if it’s too close it’s too hot for liquid water. The term habitable zone (HZ) refers to the region around a star in which an Earth-like planet could maintain liquid water on its surface at some instant in time. We specify a particular time because stars age and brighten or dim, so the HZ moves. The closest star to Earth is a triple-star system called Alpha Centauri which is at a 4. 25 – 4. 35 light years distance. The list of potentially habitable exoplanets is mostly based on estimates of habitability by the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog (HEC), and data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. The HEC is maintained by the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. Surface planetary habitability is thought to require orbiting at the right distance from the host star for liquid surface water to be present, in addition to various geophysical and geodynamical aspects, atmospheric density, radiation type and intensity, and the host star’s plasma environment. 5. 	Conclusion : Astrobiology is intriguing and challenging at the same time. Research done on origin of life and extremophiles is used to extrapolate to other planets and various moons in the solar system. Astrobiologists are primarily interested in the subsurface water oceans of these planets. Overall, follow the water has been the motto. All space agencies keep executing ambitious space missions probes, rovers, spacecrafts, telescopes, etc. Another aspect of Astrobiology which pushes science boundaries is exoplanet search. Habitable planets beyond our solar system are actively being sought after. Bio-signatures help us detect presence of Earth-like life in our solar system and beyond it. With the advancement in technology for space exploration one can expect that humans will exist as a multiplanetary species in future. There is a possibility that we are alone in the universe or who knows we might find life elsewhere. Till then let’s keep our fingers crossed. 6. 	References :  NASA Astrobiology Primer v2. 0 Shawn D.

    "title": "A list of scholarships for women in Science",
    "body": "2022/02/10 - A significant fraction of the advances in science and technology arises due to seminal contributions by women - all the while tackling a series of battles against social norms and skewed opportunities. Even today, there exists a lack of representation of women in higher education, scientific research and industry. For instance, women make up almost 43% of STEM (i. e. Science Technology Engineering and Medicine) graduates in the country, but just 14% scientists and engineers in universities/institutions. A “leaky STEM pipeline” is formed as only 3-6% of women enroll for a PhD in STEM. Even though many injustices exist as hurdles to women empowerment, various governments and organizations have come forward in combating these issues. One of the most effective ways to empower women is through education. An educated woman has the capability, knowledge and independence to take up various avenues in life independently - especially in STEM. Education starts not just at a very specialized stage, but right from primary school – where children are instilled with the dreams of exploring the edge of the universe to breaking open the smallest of particles. Poverty, the unfortunate condition that plagues a large part of our country is especially detrimental to the education of girls. Hence, in this article, we present our humble attempt at compiling a set of scholarships which are aimed at covering the education costs of girls. We have presented the scholarship data in three groups - school education, undergraduate studies, and post graduation. For each group we have presented the eligibility criteria and the scholarship amount in multiple columns, while we have linked the homepage of each scholarship for more information. We do not claim this to be an exhaustive list - in fact, this will be a “living” document which shall get updated as and when we get more information. If you, the reader, think we have missed an important scholarship scheme, please give us a shout out through the comments section below, or by contacting us directly through the form.

    "title": "Mendeley Reference Manager",
    "body": "2022/02/10 -  Being involved in research means dealing with a lot of papers on a day to day basis. Be it reading them, organizing them, or referencing them we often face a perilous task. A collection of scores of pdf documents scattered here and there in multiple folders is not something unheard of. Often we spend a lot of time looking for a particular part of the text from a paper but unable to locate it. While writing papers, and searching for references I’ve seen a lot of people doing it manually which is a waste of precious research time.  Thanks to the advances in software in the past years, we have a tool which can do it all for us, saving a lot of time and energy as well. It is ‘MENDELEY’ offered by Elsevier.  Mendeley is a library manager which can store and arrange all the pdf documents we put into it. A very informative guide is available on the official website. ​My first interaction with Mendeley was when I was doing research work related to my dissertation as a part of the M Sc. course. The scholars in that lab were pretty much using Mendeley on a day-to-day basis and from there I picked up the idea of organizing papers nicely into a library interface. It is a versatile software available for almost all desktop and mobile systems. As we use Debian based Linux for our research, there is a . deb package available on the website. There is an app on the android app store as well which can be pretty helpful in organizing the research papers. The Mendeley website offers a web library interface that is not very different from the one we have on the desktop. Apart from that, browser extensions are available for both Chrome and Firefox browsers which can be used to save the articles we open in the browser to be directly saved to the web library. In fact, the experience is extremely seamless, one can read a document on her laptop and highlight some text and can continue with the same point at her desktop at a later time. No need to waste time searching for that one particular paragraph from scores of papers put in unlimited folders. The sync works perfectly fine across all devices. One can also assign a folder in which Mendeley will automatically look for papers once the application starts. Of course, everything syncs to the web library eventually. One has to create a single Mendeley account for all the devices preferably over the website and then use the same login credentials for every device. After that the installation is pretty simple, just follow the steps in a logical fashion and within a few seconds, you’ll have your own library waiting for the papers to put it. Then there are a few ways in which the papers could be added:  Using the Chrome and Firefox browser extensions, just click on save once you come across a paper, and it’ll be dropped into your library.  Add a watch folder, and Mendeley will automatically look for files in that folder.  Add files/folders manually using a point and click interface. The documents will then be uploaded to your Mendeley account online. So once the library is set up and we have a collection of papers, the first thing to notice is that it can automatically sort and arrange the papers based on author name, title, publication year, journal name, etc. For incomplete references, Mendeley offers to search the database using the arXiv IDs or DOIs which maybe available in the document metadata. All the files are stored locally as well as synced with the cloud library. One can also create groups to keep the papers more organized. A pdf reader is built in the Mendeley package. It is a versatile pdf reader with annotation capabilities. One can mark, highlight, add comments at any point in the document. Besides the library offers a fully searchable interface meaning one can look for the exact phrase or line in a collection of 1000 papers! Imagine doing that manually. Although the basic edition is free to use, there is a limitation of 2GB storage per account. The pricing is pretty simple 5GB will cost you approximately $55/year and $165/year for unlimited storage. For me, the free edition suffices the need for now. Let’s see what happens in the future. Ever since I installed this application on my desktop, I guess I have saved a lot of time. There is no need to look for papers through my file explorer or terminal. If I have to search for a particular text snippet, I just put that in my Mendeley search bar and it searches for the same in all the papers and of course, it makes life easy. Apart from that, the inbuild BibTeX means I don’t need to run here and there for references for my texts as Mendeley can easily export all the references in BibTeX format. If I come across a nice paper, or during the arXiv search something catches my attention, it goes straight to my library within a few seconds using the Chrome extension. While writing drafts, the automatically exported . bib file is hassle-free for the bibliography. Some web links including tutorials for Mendeley are listed below:  https://www. mendeley. com/guides https://alliant. libguides. com/c. php?g=692700&amp;p=4908245 https://guides. lib. berkeley. edu/mendeley/libraryPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

    "body": "2022/02/10 - Progress is possible only when everyone capable of contributing is given an equal chance irrespective of gender, community and nationality. While there is a long way to go before this gap is fulfilled, it should be noted that we as a community have made considerable strides in meeting this agenda. Even at the dawn of independence, the majority of women were not even given a chance to study but now, in 70 years, we can happily say that women are not only earning degrees and doctorates but actively leading the world on major scientific, technological and industrial fronts! The science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in India, as is in every other country, have an unequal gender work environment. In this regard, the United Nations General Assembly has declared February 11 as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science to inspire and engage women and girls in STEM, with the hope that more girls take up science and research as a career. While the number of women in science and technology is less, their contributions are not! In order to celebrate their contributions, we at CosmicVarta have collated a list of books that commemorate the immense contribution that women across the world have made to science with an intention to inspire and arouse a scientific temper in the reader.

    "title": "Mass of the Black Hole in the nearby AGN: Mrk 590",
    "body": "2022/02/08 -  Most of the massive galaxies in the Universe host a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at their center. A minority among them are known as active galaxies and host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). These AGN are believed to be powered by the accretion of matter onto the SMBH and the emission from such accreting systems can have important effects on the host galaxy.  The central regions of such AGN are so compact to be spatially resolved by any current imaging techniques, with the exception of the broad-line region (BLR) being resolved in two nearby AGN using recent interferometric observations carried out on the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory. The angular size of the majority of the AGN is so small to be resolved using existing interferometric facilities. Therefore, alternative methods are needed to probe the central regions of AGN. One such technique is reverberation mapping, where time resolution is used as a proxy for spatial resolution.  This technique allows one to determine the mass of the SMBH, the extent of the BLR, and the dusty torus that surrounds the SMBH. This technique works on the principle of measuring the time delay between the flux variations in an ionizing source and the flux variations from the surrounding regions irradiated by the central ionization source.  Implementation of this method to find the extent of the BLR and subsequently measure the SMBH mass is usually carried out by spectroscopic monitoring observations which is not only a tedious process but also consumes an enormous amount of telescope time.   Figure 1: Subaru spectrum of Mrk 590. The broad B, R and narrow Hα and S II filters are also over-plotted. Image source : arXiv:2110. 02055 An alternative to spectroscopic monitoring observations is the method of photometric reverberation which is simple and cheap in terms of observing time. This method relies on photometric monitoring observations of the AGN through suitably selected narrow-band filters to catch the redshifted emission line response, while another filter (either narrow band or broad band) is required to trace the continuum flux . A recent work titled: Changing look AGN Mrk 590: Broad-line region and black hole mass from photometric reverberation mapping led by Amit Kumar Mandal has used the technique of photometric reverberation mapping to find the extent of the BLR in a nearby AGN, Mrk 590, located at a redshift (z) =0. 026, where the SII narrowband filter is able to monitor the Hα emission line. A few active galaxies are found to undergo a transition from Type 1 characterized by strong emission lines, to Type 1. 8 or 1. 9, with weak or no broad emission lines, or vice versa. These galaxies are known as changing look AGN. Mrk 590 is such a changing look AGN.  Figure 2: The BLR size- luminosity relation for Mrk 590 (red star) in this study. Also plotted is the same relation for all other objects whose BLR sizes are available through previous reverberation mapping campaigns. Image source : arXiv:2110. 02055 From photometric observations carried out during July to December 2018, using a moderate size 60 cm robotic telescope located at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, the research group was able to find the radius of the BLR of Mrk 590 to be 21. 44+1. 49-2. 11 days. Using this lag, and an optical spectrum of the source obtained with the 8. 2 m Subaru Telescope, the research led by Dr. Amit Kumar Mandal was able to measure the mass of the SMBH in Mrk 590 as 1. 96+0. 15-0. 21x 108 M ⦿, where M ⦿ is the mass of the Sun.

    "title": "Measuring the ages of the Earth and Moon ",
    "body": "2022/02/05 -  A popular article exploring how the ages of the Earth and Moon were measured. Introduction: Scientists present their evidence in the form of a measurement. People make many statements in everyday life. Some are qualitative and some are quantitative. In science, we try to deal only with statements that can be quantified. Otherwise, we would have no way to compare results.  Scientists use measurements to arrive at precise and quantitative statements. Mathematics is the tool through which scientists study such topics like quantity. Regarded as the language of nature, mathematics has acted as the most essential weapon in almost every known field, including natural science, engineering, medicine, finance, and the social sciences. Earth’s age: the quest begins: During any cloudless night, if you go away from the city in a place free from light pollution and if you look up towards the night sky, you will be mesmerized by a spectacular sight of thousands of stars dazzling in the sky. Naturally various questions will come to your mind like: Who created this Universe? How and why did it begin? What is the fate of the Universe? Who are we? How we came from? Are we alone in this Universe? Twinkling like diamonds, the beauty of the night sky has indeed captured the imagination of human minds since prehistoric times. Curious by nature, since our first awakening, Homo sapiens or humans have been asking these questions.  This natural curiosity of humanity gave rise to science. If one looks at the long march of human understanding, one will find that science begins with the idea that we can understand our role in the universe using logic and observation. The stars and planets were mysterious objects for most of human history. Yet ancient Greek philosophers were able to use reasoned arguments and simple geometry to estimate the sizes and distances of our neighbors in space. Similarly, the most important scientific step in understanding Earth’s history was not one particular set of measurements, but rather the mental leap of realizing that Earth had a history that could be unraveled by scientific observations and measurements. This happened mostly in the 16th and 17th centuries with the Renaissance and then with a period of time called the Enlightenment. One example of how science works is humanity’s long, step-by-step search to find the age of the Earth. By studying the Earth and the Moon, scientists have been able to piece together their linked histories. In the Middle Ages, scholars thought they could calculate Earth’s age by finding out how long humans had lived on Earth. They assumed that humanity had been around almost since Earth itself formed. Therefore, scholars analyzed ancient records, especially Biblical scriptures that listed the generations since Adam and Eve. They concluded that humanity, Earth, and the whole cosmos were only a few thousand years old. The most famous calculation was made by Irish Archbishop James Ussher in 1650. Ussher deduced that the cosmos formed on Sunday, October 23, in 4004 B. C. , and that humanity was created on Friday, October 28 the same year.  Even today, some people — especially fundamentalist religious groups — still believe that the Earth is only a few thousand years old, based on this method of reasoning.   James Ussher, the person who first deduced that Earth was formed in 4004 B. C. Image credit: Wikimedia commons.  Then, gradually evidence mounted during the 19th century that the Earth was far older than previously believed. Presently we know with reasonable confidence that our planet and its only satellite, the Moon, are a double system that formed around 460 crore (i. e. 4. 6 billion) years ago.  The Moon probably originated during a gigantic collision in the late stages of planetary formation, after the Earth’s iron core formed. But, which weapon helps us to probe the age of the Earth and Moon? How can we tell the age of so confidently? Here comes the role of mathematics. Yes, mathematics equipped with brilliant minds of scientists became the invincible tool which ultimately revealed the age of our planet and its neighbour. Without mentioning the detail history of how this feat was achieved, I shall now discuss the mathematical technique which we use to measure the ages of our Earth, any rock, fossil or even any old architechtural artifacts. Radioactive decay process: The age of the Earth-Moon system and the chronology of the Earth’s history are measured using the technique of radioactive decay. This well-understood physical process also provides the energy that drives most of the Earth’s geological evolution. In the late 1800s, the crucial discovery of radioactivity made possible even more accurate estimates of the Earth’s age. The process is worth discussing in detail since it allows us to date not only Earth but also rock samples from other worlds, such as lunar rocks and meteorites. The discovery of radioactivity happened by accident. In 1896 French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel left some photographic plates in a drawer with some uranium-bearing minerals. Later he opened the drawer and found the plates fogged. Being a good scientist, he did not dismiss the event but investigated further. He found that the uranium emitted “rays,” which, like X-rays (discovered the previous year), could pass through cardboard. The new “rays” turned out to be not electromagnetic radiation, like ultraviolet light or X-rays, but rather energetic particles emitted by unstable atoms.   Alpha decay is one example type of radioactive decay, in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle, and thereby transforms (or 'decays') into an atom with a mass number 4 less and atomic number 2 less. Image credit: Wikimedia commons.  Here is how radioactivity works. A radioactive atom is an unstable atom that spontaneously changes (usually into a more stable form) by emitting one or more particles from its nucleus. The original atom thus becomes either a new element (change in the number of protons in the nucleus) or a new form of the same element, called an isotope (change in the number of neutrons in the nucleus). The original atom is called the parent isotope and the new atom is called the daughter isotope. The time required for half of the atoms of any original radioactive parent isotope to decay into daughter isotopes is called the half-life of the radioactive element. If a billion atoms of a parent isotope were present in a certain mineral specimen, a half billion would be left after one half-life, a quarter billion after the second half-life, and so on. Sometimes the result of the decay is another radioactive element, so the decay continues. But in every case, the final product of the decay (or chain of decays) is a stable element. For example, carbon-14 decays to nitrogen-14 with a halflife of only 5,570 years. Likewise, uranium-238 decays (in a series of steps) to lead-206 with a half-life of 4. 5 billion (1 billion = 100 crore) years. Radioactivity is a random process. This means that the exact time when an individual atom decays is impossible to determine. Yet the average time for half of a very large number of atoms to decay is well determined. Radioactive Half-Life: Using the general principles of radioactive decay, scientists have developed a simple equation to calculate a rock’s age. Let us examine how a scientist might use these principles to develop such an equation. Our goal is to give the age of a rock sample in terms of the number of atoms that have decayed. Suppose a radioactive isotope has a half-life of 1 million (1 million = 10 lakhs)years. A certain number of these atoms are trapped in a crystal as molten lava cools to form a rock. After 1 million years, half of them would be left. After 2 million years, half of that amount would be left. This would be ½ × ½ = ¼ of the original number. How many would be left after 3 half-lives, or 3 million years? It would half that number again, or ½ × ½ × ½ = ⅛. From the progression of half-lives, it is easy to see how to convert from this specific description to a formula for the general case. Let’s define the fraction of the atoms that are left as F. Suppose that we wait N half-lives, and ask how many atoms would be left. Based on the paragraph above, we see that the answer would be: F = N/2 To make the same equation even more useful if you have a calculator, we can take the logarithm of both sides (base 10 logarithm), which gives: log F = N log (1/2) = -0. 301 N We can check this result. From the discussion above, we know that when N = 3 half-lives, the fraction of atoms left is 1/8. Substituting N = 3, we get log F = -0. 903. A calculator confirms F = 0. 125, or 1/8. Suppose we want to determine the age of a rock crystal and its potassium atoms. A particular radioactive form of potassium decays with a half-life of 1. 25 billion years (known to 3 significant digits), yielding a certain form of argon atoms. Suppose we measure the argon and potassium in the rock crystal, and we find that 58% of the radioactive potassium has already decayed into argon, while 42% of the original radioactive potassium atoms are left in the crystal.  How old is the rock? Our measurement has told us that F is 0. 42, and so our equation gives - 0. 376 = -0. 301 N. Thus, N = 1. 25 half-lives. That would mean that the rock is 1. 62 billion years old. Ages of the Earth and Moon: Understanding the age of the Earth was more difficult than early scientists imagined. The answer couldn’t be found by counting generations of humans. The answer couldn’t be found by measuring sedimentary layers. It wasn’t until radioactive decay processes started to be understood in the 1890s that people could begin to get an accurate measure of the age of both the Earth and the Moon. How did scientists pin down the ages of the Earth and the Moon? Using radioactive dating of rocks, we can measure the time since the rock was last melted. When rocks form from molten material, parent (and forming daughter) isotopes get locked into a single location. Prior to the rock’s formation, the products of radioactive decays could escape (for instance in the mixing of liquid lava). Once the rock solidifies, decays happen in situ. By knowing the rate of decay processes, and measuring the ratio of parent and daughter isotopes, it’s possible to place constraints on the age of a rock. Armed with the technique of radioactive dating, geologists set out to find the oldest rocks on Earth. These oldest rocks are very rare because, after billions of years, most have been destroyed by the Earth’s active geology. The oldest regions of unaltered crust are in Greenland, Western Australia, and South Africa, and they are about 3. 9 to 4. 0 billion years old. In one remarkable discovery from the Jack Hills region of Western Australia, a small zircon crystal was found with a radiometric age of 4. 404 billion years. Think of it - a mineral smaller than the head of a nail that tells us about billions of years of history! We have to add to this age an uncertain number representing the time the Earth was molten and the surface was being heavily bombarded by Solar System debris. An upper bound to the age of the Earth comes from the most primitive meteorite materials, which are inclusions rich in calcium and aluminum. This measured age of the Solar System is 4. 567 billion years. The best estimate for the total age of the Earth is 4. 54 billion years with an uncertainty of only 1%.   Lunar Olivine Basalt 15555 sample collected from the Moon by the Apollo 15 mission. It was formed around 330 crore (or 3. 3 billion years ago. It is on display in the National Museum of Natural History of USA. Image credit: Wikimedia commons.  To verify this number, scientists also wanted to date lunar rocks to see if they were comparable in age to the Earth. Each Apollo mission brought back a precious cargo of lunar rocks, soil samples, and drill cores. Together with some smaller samples brought back by earlier, unmanned Soviet probes, scientists gathered several hundred kilograms of rocks from nine different lunar sites. Lunar scientists eagerly tested these samples and began to unravel the history of the Moon.  Many of the rocks were in the range of 3 to 4 billion years old, with a few chips dating back to 4. 4 or 4. 5 billion years ago. Apparently, most rocks from the first few hundred million years of the Moon’s history were pulverized and destroyed by the intense bombardment that occurred at that time, which is why the earliest rocks and chips are rare. Scientists add about 100 million years to this age for the time it took the molten Moon to solidify. The best estimate of the age of the Moon from radiometric dating is 4. 527 billion years, slightly younger than the Earth. Absolute ages from radiometric dating were used to calibrate the relative ages of different parts of the lunar surface from crater-counting methods (see related article). Radioactive datingconfirmed what the lunar cratering record indicated: the smooth dark plains, the maria, are considerably younger than the heavily cratered highlands. Once relative ages from the cratering record were calibrated, absolute ages could also be found for other planetary surfaces, such as Mercury and Mars by assuming cratering rates were consistent throughout the inner solar system. Conclusion: The methods of radiometric dating have been refined over sixty years, and dozens of different radioactive species can be used for this research. When we apply the radioactive dating technique to all sorts of Solar System samples — terrestrial rocks, lunar rocks, and meteorites from deep space — they all yield an age of approximately 4. 6 billion years. The technique is based on the well-understood physics of radioactivity, which can be tested in the laboratory.  Scientists consider this proof of the age of the Earth, and it also led to the chronology of the entire Solar System. Consider this vast number for a moment. Compared to this, all the generations of humanity are only the blink of a cosmic eye. We’ve been around for less than a tenth of one percent of the history of our planet!

    "body": "2022/01/31 -  Starting from the history of star classification in the millinniums, this interesting note will take you through some of the very basic concepts on emission-line stars. You will be able to understand what they are and why these type of stars are my special children. The article will pose a number of very fundamental yet unresolved questions on these groups waiting to be unraveled from the nature. PS: You will not regret opening this link!   Figure 1: The most comprehensive Hubble deep field image of the evolving universe. Image source:Hubblesite . Author’s note:  I can stare all day at the image above showing details of a large number of Galaxies and stars which are the building blocks of the visible universe we know. The expanding universe, the infrared afterglow, litter from the most distant parts of our universe, remind me of the nearer still, the largely unaffected bounty of the space in my presence. Even being an ignorant survival, these depths and darkness leading one to their origin are intriguing. Introduction:: The best way to understand a system is to observe and question their behavior leading to logical reasons. In this manner, for ages, many incredible minds have corroborated the nature of stars, observed them over years, mapped their positions to good accuracy, and questioned their fundamentals, for many which even today we do not know answers to. As a first step towards this process, we explore the different types of stars and their nature using the stellar spectral classification. Stellar classification:: The oldest ever known catalogue of stars in the sky dates back to the 2nd millennium BC (1531- 1155 BC), which upgraded in number over years. But, the catalogued stars were classified into different categories based on their observable properties only by the late 19th century. Through observations, we understand that stars differ in colour and temperature. To understand these observable differences, we categorized stars based on their temperature into different ‘stellar spectral types’, assigning one alphabet for each class. The sequence of stars presently adopted, begins with the hottest stars, class O, and proceeds from hot to cool in the order: O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. Most of the stars in the visible universe can be classified into one of these groups.   Figure 2: The HR-diagram of stellar classifications. The X-axis shows different spectral types from hot massive O stars to cooler M stars. Image source: Astronomytrek . Hot massive stars usually include stars in the spectral type range O to A. It is interesting though that the physical properties, internal structure, chemical nature, and the observables of hotter stars are very different from that of their cooler counterparts. A special category of these hot stars is the emission-line stars which show prominent emission features in their spectrum. A closer look into this category reveals that not all hot massive stars show emission-line signatures. To date, we have insufficient details to explain why this nature is not universal. Many interesting studies have been conducted to date in examining the observational properties and statistical nature of these emission-line stars. What do we know about emission-line stars?: As mentioned earlier, the term emission-line stars (ELS) denote stellar objects that show emission features in their spectrum. In general, hot ELS include Classical Ae/Be type stars, Herbig Ae/Be type stars, Wolf-Rayet stars, supergiants, etc. The mechanism of the emission-line formation differs between each of these classes. Taking into consideration Classical Ae/Be stars, a group of ELS enclosing hot massive Oe, Be, and Ae stars (where ‘e’ stands for emission). The emission lines in this group of stars are known to originate from a cooler disk-shaped envelope surrounding the star. The disk is composed of ionized gas and surrounds the star equatorially. The mechanism of such a gaseous equatorial disk formation is termed the Be phenomenon.   Figure 3: An artistic impression of a Classical Be star. Note the presence of a circumstellar envelope in the shape of a disk surrounding the star. Image source: Wikimedia commons . Classical Be and Classical Ae stars: As mentioned earlier, I consider Classical Be (CBe hereafter) and Classical Ae (CAe hereafter) stars as one of the very interesting classes of objects. After 150+ years of their first detection, these stars still pose a great challenge in understanding them completely. The most fundamental (yet unresolved) question about these stars is that, Why do these stars form a circumstellar disk? It has to be noted that not all B-type stars are CBe stars, not all A-type stars CAe stars. Why do we see a selection for this emission mechanism in nature?. The better we study these stars in detail, the better we get to understand them. This research article titled Identification of new Classical Ae stars in the Galaxy using LAMOST DR5 intends at compiling the very first homogeneous catalogue of the CAe stars from our Galaxy. Identification of Classical Ae stars. : This article makes use of one of the largest spectroscopic databases of the Galaxy – Large sky Area Multi-Object fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), undertaken by the Chinese academy of sciences, situated at Xinglong Station, China. They identified about 4,789 A-type emission-line stars (Hα shows emission profile) from the LAMOST database. As quoted previously, many types of objects can show this emission feature. To identify the CAe stars, they made use of the infra-red photometric properties. The idea behind this selection is that the circumstellar disk of CBe/CAe stars will give rise to additional flux excess in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. By filtering out stars showing this additional flux, the team identified 159 new CAe stars from the Galaxy. CBe stars versus CAe stars: From Figure. 2 we understand that A-type stars are comparatively cooler than B-type stars.  Hence, the CAe stars are considered cooler counterparts of CBe stars. Though these systems show a similar presence of circumstellar disk, it is important to understand how their disk properties change concerning their temperature. This study provides a dedicated section on comparing the observed spectroscopic features of CBe stars and the CAe stars. They were able to predict that the CAe stars could host smaller disks compared to CBe stars. Apart from hydrogen, this study identified the presence of ionized metallic lines of FeII, Ca II, OI, etc in the spectra of the CAe stars and that these features are similar to that of CBe stars. This article provided new insights on the nature of the CAe stars and motivates the research community to study further study and compare them to CBe stars for a better understanding of the Be phenomenon.

    "title": "Shedding Light on the Cosmic Web with Fast Radio Bursts",
    "body": "2022/01/23 -  Fast Radio Bursts are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin. Their dispersion measures are sensitive to the presence of ionized matter along their lines of sight. This unique measurable makes FRBs a promising cosmological probe that can shed light on a hitherto invisible matter reservoir that constitutes the universe.  The study of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is one of the fastest developing fields of astronomical research. 1 Discovered serendipitously only in 2007 by Lorimer et al, FRBs are bright, millisecond-duration transient radio events. According to some estimates, thousands of FRBs occur in the sky daily. If one could see the sky in the radio frequencies, they would look like Fig. 1.   Figure 1: An artist’s rendition of what FRBs look like in the radio wavelengths. Credit: NRAO outreach Most FRBs detected have extragalactic origins with the only exception being two recently discovered radio pulse emissions from a Milky Way magnetar, a compact remnant of a supernova that sports extremely strong magnetic fields, SGR 1935+2154. As the FRB pulses travel through space, they are dispersed by plasma (ionized matter) that permeates the universe, just like sunlight disperses in a prism into a rainbow. This means the higher frequency components of the pulse travel faster than the lower frequency waves. Fig. 2 shows the dispersed pulse reported by Lorimer et al. The amount of dispersion is quantified by the Dispersion Measure (DM). DM is defined as the line-of-sight integral of electron density, weighted by the cosmological scale factor. In Fig. 2, the DM essentially tells you how far apart the 1. 5 GHz and 1. 2 GHz components are. Measuring DM therefore relies on accurately estimating the arrival delay between the high and low frequencies constituting the light and since the delay is of the order of a few seconds. Lorimer et al could not account for the burst’s large DM using estimates of matter density within our galaxy alone. It was very much this dispersion that led Lorimer et al to postulate they are extragalactic in origin. In fact, it was several times larger and the burst was estimated to have originated at a distance of &lt;1 Gigaparsec (Gpc). The sharp FRB pulse is therefore quite a unique and powerful probe of ionized matter on cosmological scales. Previously available cosmological probes of matter like quasar absorption lines are largely “blind” to ionized matter as fully ionized hydrogen and helium (which makes up most of the universe) do not produce any line features.   Figure 2: The dispersed pulse of the Lorimer Burst. The dark curve is the FRB event. The horizontal axis shows the time relative to a reference. The higher frequency components of the pulse come before the low frequency components and thus the curve goes from the top-left to bottom-right. The shape of the curve is governed by plasma physics. The inset image shows the pulse when all the frequencies are aligned (i. e. the curve is straightened) and summed over. Note how sharp the pulse is compared to the total time of the FRB event (~0. 4 s). Emission or absorption line features are manifestations of the quantum nature of an atom. In the ionized state, i. e. when atoms are stripped of their electrons, there is no quantum system to produce said features. Furthermore, continuum (i. e. non line-like) emission from electrons/ions in the intergalactic medium is extremely hard to detect due to its sparsity. FRB dispersions on the other hand provide a direct measure of the line-of-sight integrated ionized matter density. Due to their transient nature, it is only recently that FRBs have been localized in the sky with a precision better than an arcsecond thanks to advances in radio interferometry. The first FRB to be precisely localized was FRB 20121102 (by Tendulkar et al in 2017), which using the American Very Large Array (VLA), was pinpointed to a small, highly star-forming galaxy at a redshift of 0. 19. This FRB was first detected by the Arecibo telescope in 2012 and then since the source burst repeatedly albeit sporadically over the years, it was finally captured with the radio interferometer that is the VLA in 2017. In 2018, Bannister et al detected and simultaneously localized the FRB 20180924 thanks to the Australian Square-Kilometer-Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and a new technique of performing radio interferometry. ASKAP consists of several large radio antenna pointing in the same direction in the sky. The telescope essentially looks for a transient in the non-interferometric mode2, i. e. without correlating the signal from its individual antennae, to maximize the area of the sky scanned. The moment it detects a transient, the data in its buffer gets dumped to an external storage space for post-detection correlation and subsequently localization. Since the first detection, ASKAP has localized several FRBs and will continue doing so. Precise localization is crucial in pegging the FRB’s distance as the pulse itself does not carry precise information about the redshift3. Localization is crucial to identify the host galaxy and spectroscopic follow-up observations of the host yield the redshift or distance estimate4.   Figure 3: UV image of the FRB 20190608 host galaxy showing the active starforming regions (Chittidi et al 2020). The red circle/white rectangle shows the radio-derived location of the FRB which is coincident with one of the starforming clumps. Given the dispersion and the distance to the FRBs, one can start constraining the matter distribution in the foreground universe. One FRB sightline that we studied in detail was that of FRB 20190608 (see Simha et al 2020). This FRB was localized to a spiral galaxy at redshift 0. 3215 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) footprint. A UV Hubble image of the galaxy showed that the FRB originated from one of the star-forming clumps within a spiral arm (Fig. 3). Due to its fortunate location within the SDSS database, we had extensive spectroscopic information of the field galaxies. This informed us about the location of foreground galaxies relative to the sightline and thus, with some modeling, the contribution of different foreground electron reservoirs to the FRB DM. Being an integrated quantity, the DM can be split into multiple parts corresponding to the source of electrons. That is, DMFRB = DMMW + DMhalos + DMIGM + DMhost Here DMMW is the contribution from the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM) and halo, DMhost is a similar term but for the host galaxy, DMhalos is from the gas present in intervening galactic halos and DMIGM is from the diffuse filamentary gas that permeates the cosmic web5. In our work, we aimed to estimate each of these individual subcomponents from optical observations. For the Milky Way, we used models of the ISM electron distribution constructed using galactic pulsars (NE2001; Cordes and Lazio 2003). We modeled the gas distribution of the halo as a modified NFW profile (see Prochaska and Zheng 2019 for details). In total, of the 340 pc cm-3of the FRB DM, we estimated roughly 80 pc cm-3 arising from the Milky Way. Chittidi et al 2020 estimated the DMhost~100 pc cm-3 using integral field unit (IFU)6 observations with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) and the same halo model as the one used for the Milky Way. Using the SDSS and WISE photometry available for the field galaxies in tandem with the spectroscopic redshifts, we estimated the stellar masses of foreground galaxies. Then, using the stellar-to-halo-mass ratio from Moster et al 2013, we estimated their halo masses. Assuming that the halo gas typically extends up to one virial radius7, we determined which halos intersect the FRB sightline and then using our modified NFW halo gas model, determined their DM contributions. We estimated DMhalos ~ 20 pc cm-3. Estimating DMIGM was perhaps the most challenging as one cannot directly observe diffuse filamentary gas, its presence is generally inferred indirectly. However, since we had access to the SDSS galaxy redshifts, we could, in theory, reconstruct the cosmic web density using them as tracers. Thus, we leveraged the Monte-Carlo Physarum Machine (MCPM) model introduced by Burchett et al in 2020 to do exactly this. The algorithm is inspired by the motion of Physarum polycephalum or slime mold. The mold efficiently searches for food particles and produces a filamentary network connecting them in its wake. Modeling the galaxies as “food”, one can produce a steady-state slime mold particle density with MCPM and translate this to physical matter density by calibrating against dark matter density in cosmological simulations. The result (see Fig. 4) is an estimate of gas density along the sightline.   Figure 4: Cosmic web density “reconstruction” using the MCPM algorithm for the FRB 20190608 sightline. Though galaxies were cone-searched around the FRB, as it is located in one of the narrow strips of SDSS, there were more spectra available in one direction (top) than the other (side) and thus our model doesn’t appear conical. Using this model, we estimated DMIGM ~ 110 pc cm-3. Thus just using optical data, we were able to estimate DMFRB and closely match the radio measurement. Our model uncertainties are fairly large (~30%) but nevertheless, this work was a proof of concept that FRB DMs can inform us about the matter distribution in the universe. Furthermore, if this analysis is performed on multiple sightlines, we can start laying statistical constraints on some of the key model parameters that were only assumed in this work e. g. the fraction of the universe’s baryons in the filamentary gas and the fraction of halo gas present in the hot (&gt;106 K) ionized phase. In fact, our future work on the FLIMFLAM (FRB Line-of-sight Ionization Measurement with Lightcone AAOmega Mapping) survey intends to achieve ~ 10% constraints on these parameters using ~25 sightlines. We are currently collecting spectroscopic redshifts of field galaxies along multiple sightlines and hope to start producing preliminary results within the next year. FRB-aided cosmology promises exciting research in the near future. [1] See Petroff et al 2019 for an excellent review. [2] See the CRAFT webpage and this article for more details on the survey and the telescope. [3] Though the dispersion is correlated to the distance, there are many sources of uncertainty in the DM-redshift relation. [4] Astronomers use redshift as a proxy for distance when it comes to cosmological scales. This is thanks to the Hubble relation. [5] This is the large-scale structure of matter in the universe. As dark matter (and regular matter) condensed gravitationally after the Big Bang, it created halos and filamentary structures connecting halos, giving it a web-like appearance. [6] IFUs are specialized instruments that can take images as well as spectra of the field-of-view simultaneously. [7] A virial radius of a halo is the radius from its center within which the halo dark matter density is roughly 200 times larger than the background value. Think of it as the radial extent of the halo matter.

    "title": "Using machine learning to infer Solar coronal heating",
    "body": "2022/01/17 -  This article traces the origins of the coronal heating problem, and describes in vivid detail our efforts in resolving this through machine learning. This is a non-technical article based on our paper, but references have been appended for the interested reader!  The Sun is a spectacular celestial object that has captivated humanity for long and holds many unresolved secrets. It is a huge ball of gas, mainly made of hydrogen, but containing many other elements like Sodium, Calcium, Magnesium, Iron, etc. Generally, the Sun is seen as a disc in the sky. This disc of the Sun is known as photosphere, or the surface of the Sun. However, during a total solar eclipse when the Sun is hidden by the moon, streams of gas may be seen extending outwards from the photosphere as shown below. This faint region of the solar atmosphere is called the Solar corona.   Fig. 1: Image of the extended solar corona taken during an eclipse. Image source: Nicolas Lefaudeux . Since the 1900s, astronomers have been studying the Sun and various stars through the spectrum of these stars. The spectrum of any star is basically the amount of light emitted at different wavelengths. Light as we know can be (for our purposes!) thought of as a wave1, with the wavelength telling us, in some sense, how long each wave is. Stars produce light of various wavelengths, which is mainly controlled by its temperature at the photosphere. However, different elements in the atmosphere of stars can also give rise to bumps or dips in this spectrum, depending on how many electrons each element has. The number of electrons however depends on how hot the particular atom or ion is. Generally, the hotter an ion is, the fewer electrons it has. Hence, such bumps can be used to measure the temperature at various locations (and not just at the photosphere!) in the atmosphere of stars. This was the seminal contribution of Meghnad Saha and Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin2. Early on, astronomers analyzed the photosphere of the Sun, and found it to be at approximately 5500 K. In the 1940s, astronomers then took to analyzing the spectrum of the solar corona. Now, common sense tells us that as one moves away from a hot object, the temperature must reduce. Hence, we expect the solar corona to be at a lower temperature than the photosphere. However, astronomers found that as one moves from the photosphere into the solar atmosphere, the temperature initially drops and then starts rising to more than a million degrees Kelvin in the corona (Bengt Edlen. , 1945, P. Swings. , 1945)! The corona was found to be so hot, that elements like Iron, which generally have 26 electrons in their atoms, had lost more than 13 electrons! How does this occur? This has been a long-standing puzzle with a deceptively simple answer. The simple answer is: common sense is correct. Only if one moves away from a hot object will one expect the temperature to fall. It would not be the case if, for some reason, heat is generated in the solar corona. This heat source keeps the corona hot and at a million degrees Kelvin. Then the question arises: What is this source of heat? A simple guess can be made by looking at the Sun at the photosphere and in the corona. The picture below is taken from a suite of instruments called Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)[Paul Boerner et al. , 2012] &amp; Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)[P. H. Scherrer et al. , 2011] on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). SDO is a NASA satellite which observes the Sun predominantly in the photosphere and the corona. Think of it as an extremely complex camera (which it literally is!), taking pictures across different temperatures for scientists to study. The left image shows the map of the Magnetic field along the line of sight across the photosphere, with black and white representing negative and positive magnetic field polarities respectively. The grey areas have very weak magnetic fields, while the field is stronger if the color is blacker or whiter. On the right, we have the corresponding image of the corona, taken from AIA. Compare these two images carefully: it seems that the black/white areas from the magnetic field are located in the same regions as the bright areas in the corona. Hence it seems that the corona is brighter for regions with a stronger magnetic field. Might this be related to the corona’s temperature?  Fig. 2: On the left, we have the magnetic field on the Sun’s photosphere, taken through HMI. On the right, we have an image of the solar corona, taken through AIA. Image source: NASA/SDO HMI &amp; AIA . It was realized early on that the magnetic field of the Sun contains a lot of energy. This energy can, in principle, be used up to heat the corona. We now ask deeper questions: How does this occur? And how do we know this energy is enough to heat the corona? One of the more popular mechanisms of converting magnetic energy to heat is through impulsive events (Parker, E. N. , 1988). Impulsive events are basically bursts of energy, where magnetic energy is dissipated as heat. The impulsive events, which convert magnetic to heat energy, are known to occur at a variety of length and time scales. These could be large or small and may last for hours or minutes, depending on how much energy was released. The large versions of these events, which release tremendous amounts of energy, are well known as solar flares. Many studies have been done on these large flares or on smaller events called microflares. The microflares, as the name suggests, have a million times less energy than the large flares. However, they are much more frequent in the corona. The hypothesis by Parker, E. N. , 1988, and further expansion by Hudson. H. S. , 1991; is that such impulsive events are much more frequent if they have low energy, and a combination of such events may maintain the coronal temperature. This is called the nanoflare hypothesis. It essentially translates to the hypothesis that one first needs to count the number of events that occur at each energy scale. Then, suppose one finds the total heat dissipated due to all such events at each energy to be larger for smaller events. In that case, impulsive heating is enough to maintain the solar corona’s temperature. Studies generally attempt to count how many events occur at given energy and get a sense of how much energy is released in such events. Then, they compare if these energies are enough to maintain the corona at a million-degree Kelvin or not. Such statistics, however, are ridden with a grave fallacy: If individual events can be seen, we can count them. What if we cannot even see these individual events? What if all we see is a combination of a multitude of such events? This question has plagued solar physicists for a long time. A possible answer to this question lies in what in the corona do we see. Studies are generally targeted towards the large, bright, and beautiful structures called Active Regions. In Fig. 3, a picture of the solar corona is seen. Immediately, we can see that there is a bright region near the center, and this is called an Active Region. These active regions contain a large amount of magnetic energy which can be converted to heat. However, there are other regions in the corona where there are no beautiful large structures. These structures are known as Quiet regions.  Approximately every 11 years, the Sun is seen to wake up, become violent, and then go to sleep. This is known as the solar cycle. The active regions are predominantly seen when the Sun is active (the violence comes from active regions, mostly!). The solar corona, on the other hand, is hot even when the Sun is quiet and sleeping! This means we must study this quiet time to figure out coronal heating!  Fig. 3: The solar corona as seen from the 211 A passband of AIA shows two distinct structures here. One kind of structure is the bright Active Regions, and the other is the background calm Quiet Sun. Image source: Solar Dynamics Observatory . In our work, we addressed (or rather, incorporated) both of these characteristics to provide constraints on the viability of these impulsive events. First off, we took only the Quiet Sun data. All other large, dynamic events were left out. Second, we used a statistical impulsive heating model (A. Pauluhn et al. , 2006) to infer heating signatures. But how? Enter Deep learning. Deep learning is a set of techniques (generally referring to neural networks) used to perform inferences on big data. These neural networks can “learn” the data given to them and perform any assigned task. When you check for translation of words on Google, it basically deploys deep learning in the background. The neural network used for such language-to-language translations has been trained on many statements and correspondences between two languages. Hence, when you ask it to translate words (or even sentences), it can translate pretty much very well! For our work, we took the statistical impulsive heating model and made a large number of simulations. The impulsive heating model generates a time series of intensity (called light curves), given some free parameters. These simulations statistically would represent the light curves of the Quiet corona. However, there are no objective techniques to compare these simulations with observations in a statistically robust manner. Hence, we trained our deep learning model on mapping the light curves back to the free parameters. This is called learning an inversion code. The inversion code takes in the light curves, analyzes them in a highly complicated non-linear way, and gives out the best parameter set representing the light curve. The inversion code is checked on a testing set of simulations. Think of this whole procedure as attending a class (=training) and writing an exam (=testing). Since you typically do not know what questions will be asked in an exam, the testing set contains simulations that were not used for training. Hence, the performance of the inversion code is checked and validated in this way. Once this inversion code is checked, we apply it on approx. 3,00,000 light curves from the Sun to infer the free parameters. In this way, we circumvent the problem of not seeing individual events in the Quiet Sun – we can infer their statistical signatures! This scheme is explained below:  Fig. 4: A summary of our procedure. The simulated light curves are mapped to their parameters by training a deep learning model, which in our case is a Convolutional Neural Network. Then, these parameters can be inferred by feeding in the observed light curves in the model. So what do we get from applying this elaborate scheme? We find the impulsive events occur at a frequency of around 2 events per minute. Each event lasts approximately 10-20 mins. Overall, we find smaller events to dominate over larger events, which seems to confirm the hypothesis of impulsive heating of the corona. Then, we studied various properties of these heating events. First, we found that events can be either large and occur rarely, or be very small and occur frequently. This means that there exists a well of energy, that can be emptied by occasional large buckets or very frequent small buckets. Second, we found that larger events die down much faster than smaller events. This counterintuitive result seems to arrive as a result of what is called thermal conduction. Thermal conduction is the reason why, if you leave the ladle for too long in the kadai, it gets very hot. Heat travels through metal efficiently, and makes it hotter. Hotter the kadai3, the faster the ladle gets hotter. Similar phenomenon occurs in the corona, but here the ladle is the magnetic field lines, and the kadai is the impulsive event. The thermal conduction along magnetic field lines is very efficient, so the more the energy, the faster it is transmitted. We find signatures of this thermal conduction through our analysis. Finally, we find excellent correspondence between the properties of these small-scale events and large-scale events like solar flares. It almost seems like the small events we find are like younger siblings of the large-scale flares. And through a marriage of deep learning with solar physics knowledge, we can impose constraints on the heating of the solar corona!

    "title": "Bar Buckling and Boxy/Peanut Bulges as the Tracer of Dark Matter Halo Shape",
    "body": "2022/01/14 -  Galaxies reside in the deep potential of invisible matter called dark matter. Their dynamics is significantly affected by the distribution of dark matter around them. Distribution of dark matter around galaxies is usually known as dark matter halo. Most of the previous studies of galaxies assumed spherical dark matter halos. But, cosmological simulations of structure formation suggest that the dark matter halo can vary in shape. It can also have non-spherical shape (e. g. oblate and prolate) which can significantly influence the evolution of the galaxy. In this study, Astronomer from IIA, Bangalore and SJTU, China have studied the effect of non-spherical dark matter halos on the buckling of the bars and formation of boxy/peanut shape bulges. They perfomed a set of numerical simulation for varying dark matter halo shape and traced the formation of bars and boxy/peanut shape bulges.  If you look at the clear night sky, you may find a white bright band stretching from north to south in the sky. It is nothing but our home galaxy, the Milky Way. There are trillions of galaxies in our observable Universe. Galaxies are gravitationally bound systems of stars, gas, dust, and invisible matter called dark matter. Galaxies come in different shapes and sizes ranging from spherical - like a ball to disk - like a round plate. Since most of the disk galaxies have spiral arms, they are also called spiral galaxies. Depending on the presence of a bar, a spiral galaxy could be a barred spiral or unbarred spiral. Disk galaxies usually possess a dense collection of stars in their centres which is termed as the bulge. Bulges can range from nearly spherical to as flat as the disk of galaxies. Our Milky way has a boxy/peanut shape flat bulge which is supposed to have formed from the thickening of the bar.   Figure 1: Example of unbarred and barred galaxies. Image source:NED . The matter we can see in a galaxy is far less than its actual matter content. More than 80% of the total galaxy mass is invisible to us. Only the motion of the stars or gas in the galaxy shows the presence of dark matter. This invisible matter is commonly referred to as dark matter. Due to the presence of an enormous amount of dark matter in the galaxy, the dynamics of the stars is remarkably affected by the distribution of the dark matter. In the past, there have been several detailed studies of the galaxies assuming the spherical distribution of dark matter in the galaxies. There are very limited works that consider the non-spherical distribution of dark matter for the study of galaxies. In the present paper, Ankit Kumar and the team have investigated the effect of non-spherical dark matter distribution on the bar buckling and the formation of boxy/peanut flat bulge like that seen in our Galaxy. Bar buckling is a bar thickening mechanism where the bar suddenly bends out of the disk of the galaxy. Bar buckling can be simply understood using a practical example of a beam or pillar. Say, there is a vertically standing beam and you start increasing the load on it. Then at some point, it will suddenly bend somewhere in the middle (or may collapse). This sudden change is called the buckling of the beam.   Figure 2: Examples of oblate, spherical, and prolate dark matter halos in a disk galaxy. Image source: Author. Authors have used the supercomputing facility to generate mock realistic disk galaxies and to evolve them in time. The distribution of dark matter in the galaxies ranges from oblate to prolate including spherical one. Oblate distribution (or oblate halo) looks like the shape formed on squeezing a sphere from its top and bottom whereas prolate distribution (or prolate halo) is similar to the shape formed on stretching a sphere from its top and bottom. To trace the formation and evolution of the bar and buckling events, they used Fourier analysis and found that the galaxies in prolate halos form bar earlier than the galaxies in oblate halos. Also, the bar in prolate halos buckles before the bar in the oblate halos. Fourier analysis is the method to decompose any general function or structure into simple trigonometric functions or structures with definite frequencies (see this article  for Fourier series). Buckling events are very rarely observed. To date, there are only 8 confirmed galaxies that are currently going through the buckling events. In this study, Ankit Kumar and the team found three distinct buckling events for the bar in the prolate halo. It is the first time where more than two buckling events in a bar have been detected in any study. The total duration of buckling is longer for the bar in the prolate halo. The rarity of buckling in observations and longer duration buckling in the prolate halos lead authors to conclude that most of the dark matter halos could be oblate and spherical in shape.   A clear buckling of the iso-density contour can be seen in the outer bar of the prolate halo during the 3rd buckling event. It also shows the formation and growth of peanut shape bulge after bar buckling. Image source: Kumar et. al. 2021. . Each buckling event makes the bar thick in size. First buckling thickens the innermost region of the bar while the succeeding bucklings thicken the outer regions of the bar. As a result of these thickening boxy/peanut shape flat bulge forms. Since the bar in the prolate halo shows more buckling events as compared to the oblate halo, the bar in prolate halo thickens the most and forms the most thicker boxy/peanut shape bulge.

    "title": "Using GitHub for Academic Research",
    "body": "2022/01/10 -  GitHub has become the go-to tool for software engineers across the world to keep their codes together and collaborate with each other. Being easy, seamless, and available on all the platforms makes it a brilliant choice indeed.  I am involved in academic research for quite some time now and can find some pretty good uses for this platform. Of course, GitHub was designed to keep the codes together and collaborate and this is the backbone of research too, which is why I find GitHub quite appealing. There are obvious benefits of using GitHub:  Keeping all the codes and data files together offline as well as a backup on the GitHub servers.  Version control for all the files.  Collaborating on projects together.  Managing the research projects and keeping track of the issues.  Free hosting for websites. For beginners, it is helpful to go through the basic documentation about GitHub. For example a YouTube video introducing GitHub is available below: Besides the GitHub website itself, there are plenty of other websites and tutorials available on the web. I am including a few bare essentials that one needs to go through in order to understand what GitHub is:  Creating a git repository Cloning a git repository A tutorial for git usage Guide to git version control Introduction to Branches GitHub Project Boards Github pagesThe idea of having a single repository (in git terminology folder is repository) for a project helps a lot in reducing confusion and saves a lot of time. It indeed is a good habit. Making that repository a git repository and putting it on GitHub is an even better habit. People working with Jupyter notebooks may find GitHub extremely helpful, especially in terms of executing the notebooks in the clouds. nbviewer can load the notebooks directly from the git repository which can then be executed directly on binder. Even Google colab allows the import of notebooks from GitHub directly to be executed there. HackMD, a Markdown editor allows the files to be pushed to and pulled from GitHub. In astronomy, most of the code is often open-source and available to the community. Some researchers provide links to their codes hosted on GitHub which becomes easier to obtain and raise any issues. The point is that the familiarity with GitHub is advantageous. People sometimes present their entire work, including the codes, plots, and related text files on GitHub as a repository which indeed serves as a welcome step towards reproducible research. Now, my personal bent towards git is motivated by the reproducibility of research. In the world of academic research reproducibility has often been cited as a problem (see this BBC report or Nature article). Reproducibility should be the backbone of research as scientific findings work on this principle. Maintaining a git project should help in establishing this easily. One may put the link to the entire working repository once their findings are published so that anyone willing to re-do the analysis does that seamlessly. People have even proposed a GitHub type of social network for academic research. I have tried to implement GitHub for all my research projects, and the workflow has only gone smoother with time. The project management becomes easy, versions are easy to track and overall the repository structure becomes more transparent with time. I don’t waste time looking for individual files anymore, as they have been neatly arranged in the respective places. With a backup on the GitHub cloud server, it becomes easy to access any item from any device. Working on multiple devices too becomes easy as I can run multiple items in parallel and then push to the respective branches and merge them subsequently. Moreover, the project boards are a neat way to organize all the work. We can have work in progress, work to be done, and work that has been completed arranged in the form of cards. We may open an issue from these cards themselves. Github pages are also one of the noticeable features of Github as it lets one host personal webpages on GitHub, which again I feel is well suited for us. The static website can be put up easily using Jekyll. The academic pages template is used by thousands of researchers and scientists around the world to keep their content together on a static web page. My personal website is hosted on GitHub too. Pushing things on the website is as easy as typing up a markdown or HTML file and pushing it onto GitHub. GitHub as a service provides us with an option to manage our workflow in an eficient way, without worrying about versions of documents and provides seamless collaboration features. I hope with this article I have provided some useful insight into this service. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. "

    "title": "How strong is a neutron star's magnetic field? <br> ",
    "body": "2022/01/05 - Estimating the strength of the magnetic field of a neutron star in a binary star system ‘Cen X-3’:  Researchers from Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bangalore, report the detection of cyclotron resonant absorption feature (CRSF) in the X-ray spectrum of the binary star system ‘Cen X-3’. The magnetic field of the neutron star in Cen X-3 is estimated from the CRSF. This work is a step forward in understanding the nature of humongous magnetic fields of Neutron Stars.  Researchers from Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bangalore, report interesting findings about the binary star system ‘Cen X-3’ from the constellation ‘Centaurus’, one of the most luminous X-ray sources in our galaxy and the first-ever X-ray pulsar to be discovered. Their findings published in the Monthly Notices of Royal Astronomical Society, uses data from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) of NASA and Suzaku, an X-ray satellite operated by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.  Cen X-3 is a two-star system consisting of a pulsar - a highly magnetized neutron star beaming X-rays - and a companion star. The magnetic field of a neutron star in Cen X-3 is estimated in this work. The findings also provide insights into understanding the nature of humongous magnetic fields of Neutron Stars. Imagine a star as massive as our Sun but only a few kilometers across in size: that’s a neutron star! It is so dense that the mass of the entire living human population could fit into a sugar cube-sized neutron star matter. In other words, it is like an entire Mount Everest squeezed to fit inside a coffee cup. Owing to their extreme density, the gravitational field of a neutron star is the strongest except for black holes. In fact, if they were any denser, they would become black holes themselves. Neutron stars have some pretty bizarre properties. Their gravity is strong enough to bend light. They are extremely hot, with a surface temperature of nearly a million degrees Celsius. Even stars hate to be alone! The majority of the neutron stars like the one in Cen X-3 are a part of a binary star system with the main sequence or post main sequence star as a companion. The neutron star gravitationally accretes matter from its companion star. The accretion disk is formed around the neutron star when the angular momentum of the accreted matter is too large for the direct impact onto the neutron star surface.   Figure 1: Inside the magnetosphere, the accreting matter is channeled along the magnetic field lines and onto the magnetic poles forming an accretion column. Image used here is available at this URL. Accretion of matter onto a compact object such as a neutron star or black hole is one of the most efficient ways known for extracting energy from matter. The denser the object, the higher is the efficiency! Part of this energy is emitted in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The magnetic field of a neutron star is almost a trillion times greater than that of the Earth. Such a high magnetic field dictates the accretion flow inside the magnetosphere. The accreting matter is channeled along the magnetic field lines and onto the magnetic poles forming an accretion column. The neutron star’s rotational axis is not necessarily aligned with its magnetic axis. Such misalignment gives rise to highly periodic pulsations hence the name ‘pulsars’.   Figure 2: Illustration of an accretion-powered pulsar. The magnetic axis sweeps earth in every rotation of the neutron star due to misalignment between the rotational axis and the magnetic axis giving rise to highly periodic pulsations. The image used here is available at this URL. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, all particles show wave-like characteristics. The wavelength associated with the particle is called the de Broglie wavelength (λ de Broglie = Planck’s constant/momentum). The length scales that we deal with in day-to-day life are much larger than the de Broglie wavelength of the particles. The wave nature of the particles and associated quantum mechanical phenomenon becomes apparent only when the length scale of the system is comparable to its de Broglie wavelength.   Figure 3: Landau quantization and resonant scatteringImage courtesy: Ashwin Devaraj (IISc-JAP) In the presence of a magnetic field, the charged particles in the accretion column rotate around the magnetic field lines in a helical trajectory. Larger the magnetic field, the smaller the radius of gyration. The orbits and corresponding energies are quantized due to a phenomenon called landau quantization; however, its effect becomes significant only in the presence of an extremely strong magnetic field where the radius of the gyration of the infalling particle is of the order of its de Broglie wavelength. The photons generated during the accretion undergo scattering with the relativistically infalling matter in the accretion column. Due to resonance, the likelihood of scattering i. e. the scattering cross-section is maximum at the quantized Landau energy levels resulting in the absorption-like feature at those energies in the X-ray spectrum (energy distribution of the incident light). This feature is called a cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF). Figure 3 illustrates the quantization of the orbits and the resonant scattering of photons. Gunjan Tomar (RRI, Bangalore) and the team studied CRSF originated due to the scattering of photons with electrons in the X-ray spectrum of Cen X-3. The energy of the CRSF is directly related to the strength of the magnetic field. It is the only direct way to measure a neutron star’s magnetic field strength. The energy of the electron CRSF feature was observed to be around 30 KeV. The neutron star magnetic field can be estimated to be around 2. 6 x 1012 Gauss from this. The strength of the magnetic field of the neutron star increases steeply as one approaches the stellar surface. The CRSF energy is related to the magnetic field strength and thus depends on where the CRSF originates. The matter accretion rate which is directly related to the source luminosity is thought to affect the location of the origin of the CRSF feature. The relation between the CRSF energy and the source luminosity would strengthen the above argument. However, researchers could not find any such relation. This research is a step forward in understanding the gigantic magnetic field of a neutron star and its role in the accretion of matter.

    "title": "Deciphering The Mysteries of The Quiet Sun Explosions",
    "body": "2021/12/30 -  XSM onboard Chandrayaan 2 observed the Sun during its minimum activity period in 2019-2020. Using this data, the researchers have for the first time detected a very large number of small scale explosions, called microflares, happening on the Sun. The physical parameters of the microflares have been calculated and their spatial location is also detected using various satellites. The study also gives evidence that such small scale heating events occur everywhere on the Sun and they contribute to coronal heating.  The outer atmosphere (the corona) of the Sun poses a long standing mystery regarding its temperature. The solar corona is composed of plasma (ionised gas) that emits strongly in X-rays and ultraviolet radiation. Its temperature exceeds a million degree kelvin, while the visible surface (the photosphere) is at 6000K. One of the theories to understand the so-called ‘coronal heating problem’ proposes the occurrence of a large number of small scale explosions (known as microflares and nanoflares) on the Sun. It is known that these flares are a manifestation of the magnetic field of the Sun that is generated in its interior. But the Sun’s magnetic field is not constant, it varies with an average period of 11 years, which is known as the solar cycle. Approximately every 11 years, the Sun’s magnetic field reverses. In other words, the north pole becomes the south pole, and vice versa. The flip of the poles is an end product of the slow evolution of Sun’s magnetic field over time. As the cycle progresses, all of the Sun’s activities related to its magnetic field (such as sunspots, flares, coronal mass ejections) builds to a maximum (when the magnetic field reverses). Then the Sun settles back down to a minimum, before the whole cycle starts again. The Sun was in a very low state of activity during the minima of solar cycle 24 covering the year 2019. It was in fact the quietest the Sun has been in the last 100 years! During this quiet period of the Sun, at the mid of the year 2019, Chandrayaan 2 was launched with the several instruments/payloads to observed our moon and the Sun. Among them CLASS is an instrument to understand the abundance of elements present on the moon. But this requires knowledge of the X-rays emitted from the Sun. Thus, the orbiter also carried an instrument called Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM). XSM observed the Sun during its deepest minima of solar cycle 24, covering the year 2019-2020 with a good temporal and energy resolution. Using observations during this time, Santosh Vadawale and his team has uncovered some fascinating information about the quiescent Sun. They have shown that during this period small scale transients, so-called microflares (smaller counterpart of the conventional solar flares) are occurring everywhere on the solar disk. Solar flares are eruptions of electromagnetic radiation of all wavelengths from the Sun. They last from a few minutes to a few hours. Flares are classified depending on the energy they release during its peak in the soft X rays. Though the number of large flares increase with the progress of the solar cycle, this study suggested that small flares, called microflares, keep exploding on the Sun at all times. Though the definition of microflares has varied though the years due to the sensitivity of the instrument, in this study flares having a peak flux below 10-8 W/m2 are considered as microflares. During this period of extremely quiet solar corona when no active regions were present on the disk, Santosh Vadawale and team identified a total of 98 microflares from 76 days. The microflares are marked in the lightcurve (Figure 1). Most of the microflares were seen to behave similar to larger flares having a fast rise and a slow decay. Some microflares did not follow this behaviour possibly due to blending of multiple microflares or they intrinsically have a different origin. The temperature and emission measure of these microflares are determined. Temperature tells how hot the plasma gets during the explosion while the emission measure gives an idea about the density of plasma emitted at that particular temperature. The temperature is found to be between 3-6 MK and the emission measure is in the order of 1046 cm-3.  Figure 1: XSM lightcurve during the period of deepest solar minima of the past century. Red vertical lines indicate the detected microflares outside the conventional active regions. Image source: S. Vadawale et al. , 2021. The XSM microflare locations are identified in the extreme ultraviolet images obtained from NASA’s ‘Solar Dynamics Observatory’ and from the X-ray images obtained by the Japanese HINODE X-ray Telescope. Most microflares were seen to be associated with X-ray Bright Points. ‘Solar Dynamics Observatory’ HMI magnetograms were used to analyse the corresponding photospheric magnetic field. They observed the microflares to be associated with magnetic bipolar regions having weaker field strengths, which indicates magnetic reconnection happening at smaller scales (Figure 2).

This is also the first statistical survey of X-ray microflares outside active regions. By plotting the frequency distribution of microflares, the team has given evidence for the hypothesis that small scale heating events occur everywhere on the Sun and they contribute to coronal heating.

    "title": "Measuring the age of the Universe: An overview",
    "body": "2021/12/25 -  A popular article exploring how the age of the Universe was calculated.  Introduction: The previous article has already provided a flavour of how scientists use mathematics combined with knowledge obtained from physics to reveal numerous hidden secrets of nature such as the age of the Earth, the Moon and even the Solar System. But the story does not end here. It literally cannot. This is because the curiosity of human beings is unquenchable. Naturally, any curious mind will ask the next question, what is the age of the universe? Fortunately, the power of human intellect combined with the supreme efficiency of mathematics and physics have provided an answer to this almost impossible to solve question also. We now know with reasonable confidence that our universe is around 13. 8 billion (i. e. 1380 crore since 1 billion = 100 crore) years old. But, how do we measure the age of the universe? To know the answer, one has to study ‘cosmology’. This might be one of the most thrilling detective stories of all time. Cosmology is the study of the size, structure and evolution of the universe — in other words, the geography of the universe as a single system. In cosmology, our subject is the whole universe, defined as all matter and energy in existence anywhere, observable or not. Birth of cosmology: One of the most fundamental questions of humanity is the question of origins:  Where did we come from? This question runs deeper than the origins of any one person and delves into questions of where did life, our planet, and the entire universe come from. Many cultures have avoided the notion of an origin to the universe by placing their creation stories in a cycle. Buddhist and Hindu origins stories measure the birth, death, and rebirth of the universe in units of 4 trillion years, which is a day in the life of Brahma. At night, all matter is absorbed into the spirit of the sleeping Brahma. At dawn, when Brahma awakes, matter reappears and the cycle continues. The Greek Stoics saw the universe as being created from fire, only to be destroyed by fire, and so on. Cosmological cycles are also found in the cultures of the Maya and the Aztec. The story of modern cosmology began with Albert Einstein and Edwin Hubble. From Einstein’s theories, the shape of space is described as being warped by gravity. From the observations of Hubble, we learned the universe is expanding. Together these two men described the evolving shape of space and they opened up a new field of science called cosmology. The Big Bang model: The modern theory of the origin of the universe starts with the idea of expanding space. Georges Lemaître was a priest and a mathematician, an unassuming man who had beaten the giants of physics to the punch in deducing that the universe could be expanding. In 1929, Lemaître was the first to hypothesize a revolutionary idea: at one time, the universe might have been as small as an atomic nucleus. He proposed that the universe derived from a cosmic singularity, a day without a yesterday when the universe was infinitely small and infinitely curved, and all matter and energy were concentrated in a single point. Many astrophysicists found the idea bizarre and distasteful and English theorist Fred Hoyle disparaged the idea with the name big bang. The label stuck, and scientists continue to call the description of the creation of the universe the Big Bang model.   Figure 1: According to the Big Bang model, the universe expanded from an extremely dense and hot state and continues to expand todayImage source:Wikipedia . The Big Bang model forces us to consider the idea of cosmic evolution. The universal recession of galaxies implies that the universe is evolving, and it has not always been in the same state. Our observations of nearby galaxies represent a single frame in a movie that has been playing for billions of years. We can wind the tape backwards, seeing snapshots of a progressively older universe, by observing sets of galaxies at progressively larger distances, and thus at progressively larger look back times. (Since light takes time to travel, we see objects far away as they looked when the light was released rather than as they are now. ) As we look back into the early universe, we can see the galaxies move closer together. Observationally, we can’t see all the way back to the first moments, but we can see times when galaxies were just forming, and the large scale structures — the cosmic walls and voids — were just starting to form. If we could look further back, we’d see that as the universe gets smaller; its volume contracts until all the mass are smashed together in a tiny universe. The mass that formed galaxies and stars breaks down into a seething hot gas, as the universe tends toward a state of infinite temperature and density. Thinking of the Big Bang as an explosion is tempting, but it is also misleading. In an explosion on Earth, debris flies through space. In the Big Bang, the initial singularity contains all space and matter. Time itself begins with the big bang. The evolution of the universe is the unfolding of time and space from a condition of incredible heat and density to cold and enormous state billions of years later. This bang had no center, it had no past and it simply was the sudden beginning of everything in an expanding geometry that may or may not be finite. The scientific story of creation says that everything — you and the Earth and the Sun and the Milky Way and all the billions of galaxies — emerged from a tiny dense dot of energy and matter that unfolded into the universe we see now. It sounds as fantastic as any of the creation myths of older cultures. How do we know that the big bang actually occurred? There are three primary pieces of evidence:  Galaxies are taking part in a universal expansion as indicated by the linear relation between distance and redshift (the Hubble relation).  The abundance of the lightest elements can be explained by fusion in the universe when it was young and dense and hot (cosmic nucleosynthesis).  Space is filled with the radiation from the early hot phase, now diluted and reduced in energy to the level of microwaves (the cosmic microwave background). Describing each of these concepts is beyond the scope of this article. But the Hubble relation mentioned in the first point bears huge importance in measuring the age of the universe. Hence, I shall take the opportunity to discuss in brief the Hubble relation. Hubble relation or Hubble’s law: The Hubble relation, popularly known as the Hubble’s law or Hubble–Lemaître law is considered the first observational basis for the expansion of the universe and today serves as one of the pieces of evidence most often cited in support of the Big Bang model. Although widely attributed to Edwin Hubble, the notion of the universe expanding at a calculable rate was first derived from the general relativity equations in 1922 by Alexander Friedmann. Friedmann published a set of equations, now known as the Friedmann equations, showing that the universe might expand, and presenting the expansion speed if this was the case. Then Georges Lemaître, in a 1927 article, independently derived that the universe might be expanding, observed the proportionality between the recessional velocity of and distance to distant bodies and suggested an estimated value of the proportionality constant, which when corrected by Hubble became known as the Hubble constant. Then in 1929, Edwin Hubble confirmed the existence of cosmic expansion and determined a more accurate value for the constant that now bears his name. Hubble inferred the recession velocity of the objects from their redshifts, many of which were earlier measured and related to velocity by Vesto Slipher in 1917.   Figure 2: Georges LemaîtreImage source:Wikipedia .   Figure 3: Edwin HubbleImage source:Britannica .   Figure 4: Fred HoyleImage source:The Guardian . The law is often expressed by the equation: v = H0D  (1) where, v is the recessional velocity, typically expressed in km/s. H0 is Hubble’s constant and corresponds to the value of H (often termed the Hubble parameter which is a value that is time-dependent and which can be expressed in terms of the scale factor) in the Friedmann equations taken at the time of observation denoted by the subscript 0. This value is the same throughout the universe for a given comoving time. D is the proper distance (which can change over time, unlike the comoving distance, which is constant) from the galaxy to the observer, measured in megaparsecs (Mpc), in the 3-space defined by given cosmological time. The reciprocal of H0 is the Hubble time. This constant term H0 help us to estimate the age of the universe. Let me now discuss in brief how it does so. Age of the Universe: When Einstein, Lemaitre, and others solved the equations of general relativity, they were able to describe how the size of the universe has changed with time. Astronomers use the symbol R to represent the scale or size of the universe at any time. You can think of R as the size of the universe, but more accurately it represents the distance between any two well-separated places. The cosmological principle says that any two points are moving apart at the same rate. Thus, the entire history of the universe is described by the way that R varies with time. Since the universe is expanding, R has been continuously increasing for billions of years. Remember that R describes the expansion of space that carries galaxies apart — the galaxies themselves are not expanding. Galaxies are just markers of expanding space. The Big Bang model even provides a prediction for the age of the universe. If we imagine the evolving universe as a movie, the birth of the universe is the time in the distant past when all matter and radiation was crushed in a state of infinite temperature and density. The scale factor, R, was zero. Space had not yet begun to unfold. There are three ways to constrain the age of the universe. But in many ways, looking at the expansion rate of the universe is one of the easiest ways to figure out the universe’s age. This technique looks at the current expansion rate and then running it backwards to determine when today’s universe must have been compressed down to a single point. Mathematically, the age of the universe is: t0 = 1 / H0f (Ωr Ωm Ωλ;…)  (2) Where t0 is the current age, H0 is the current expansion rate, and f is a correction that takes into consideration the mass, energy, and other characteristics of the universe. For this method to work, you need to not only know the current expansion rate but also how this rate has changed over time due to the effects of gravity and the effect of dark energy (Ωλ;), which is pushing the universe apart. The best published value for the expansion rate is H0=70. 6 ± 3. 1 (km/sec) / Mpc. This means that every Megaparsec of space expands roughly 70. 6 km each second. Based on stellar evolution models, we estimate the oldest globular star clusters are between 11 and 13 billion years old. Apart from these two techniques, the most trusted means of determining the age of the universe comes from very precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The CMB is a diffuse, uniform background of microwave radiation that comes from all directions in the sky. This CMB is the electromagnetic radiation which is the remnant from an early stage of the universe, also known as relic radiation. First observed accidentally by the radio engineers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson in 1965, CMB is a crucial piece of evidence that supports the big bang model for the origin of the universe. Three space missions, in particular, have been instrumental in measuring this radiation in finer and finer detail and with better and better precision. NASA’s Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) took data from 1989 to 1996 and it was the first to detect tiny variations in the intensity of the radiation. Next came the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), launched by NASA in 2001. WMAP took data for a decade and its very accurate measurements put constraints on a set of parameters of the big bang model. The current state-of-the-art experiment is ESA’s Planck mission, launched in 2009. The level of accuracy of Planck data is tens of thousands of times greater than the discovery measurements of Penzias and Wilson. Based on the WMAP measurements and theoretical models, the universe is estimated to be 13. 82 ± 0. 12 billion years old. This is the most quoted age used by astronomers and is consistent with both other measurements within their errors. Remarkably, you can see that this value is very close to what has been estimated using the Hubble constant in equation 2. Conclusion: Very early in the history of mankind, ignorance of nature and fear of the unknown naturally made men religious. So God played a central role in primitive societies. They tried to answer every question with the help of God. As time passed, with experience and intellect men could understand more and more of the natural phenomenon. I have mentioned in my previous article that if one looks at the long march of human understanding, one will find that science begins with the idea that we can understand our role in the universe using logic and observation. Today humans have come a long way. And mathematics has truly acted as the most essential weapon in almost every known field, including astronomy. By now any reader will understand that in these two articles, I’ve discussed in brief how mathematics in simple form also has helped in the development of astronomy and human knowledge as a whole.

    "title": "Futuristic gravitational wave observations to resolve dichotomy of compact objects",
    "body": "2021/12/19 -  Gravitational waves are invisible ripples in space travel at the speed of light. It is generated in different scenarios, such as when two celestial bodies orbit around each other, an isolated body with tri-axial symmetry spins, inhomogeneity in matter distribution in the early universe, etc. Gravitational-wave astronomy aims to study these waves to improve the understanding of objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, events such as supernovae, and processes including those of the early universe shortly after the Big Bang. The article describes how futuristic gravitational wave observatories can be used to resolve the dichotomy of compact objects.  Historically, astronomy primarily relies on electromagnetic radiation. Over the past hundred years, various interesting astronomical objects have been discovered with gamma-ray detectors to radio telescopes. In recent years, gravitational wave astronomy has opened a new window to probe various exciting objects, and we can now look into the universe from a very different perspective. LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave detectors have so far made tens of detections from the merger of various compact objects. These are ground-based detectors operating at frequencies more than 1 Hz. As time progresses, these detectors have been upgraded continuously to increase their sensitivities so that we can look objects residing at further distances. Moreover, around 2035, a space-based gravitational wave mission, LISA is planned to launch, which would operate at less than 1 Hz frequency. Many interesting objects such as galactic binaries, massive binaries, extreme mass ratio inspirals, etc. , emit gravitational radiation at less than 1 Hz frequencies. Hence the current ground-based detectors cannot detect these objects, and LISA is planned to probe them. It is important to note that none of these objects are isolated in nature. Recently, a group of researchers have claimed that LISA might detect some isolated compact objects too. The term compact objects primarily represent white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. White dwarfs are the end state of stars with mass less than (10&#177;2) M⊙, where M⊙ ~2 x 1030 kg is the mass of the sun, in which the hydrogen fusion has stopped. One such object is the super-Chandrasekhar white dwarf. Over the past couple of decades, various researchers have detected more than a dozen over-luminous type Ia supernovae. Based on these observations, they have inferred that these supernovae have to be originated from massive white dwarfs, which violate the standard Chandrasekhar mass limit of 1. 4 M⊙. As a result, these objects are often termed as super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs. It has been shown that if a white dwarf possesses strong magnetic fields at the center, such white dwarfs can indeed hold mass more than 1. 4 M⊙. Moreover, if such a white dwarf rotates in such a way that there is a misalignment between its magnetic and rotation axes, it can emit continuous gravitational waves. These researchers have explicitly shown that if a white dwarf has a strong central field but a weaker field at its surface, LISA can detect it within 1 year of detection period. On the other hand, if the white dwarf possesses a strong surface field or a weak central field, LISA will not be able to detect it. However, such white dwarfs can be detected by some other futuristic detectors, such as BBO, DECIGO, etc. In this way, LISA can directly confirm the existence of super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs (Fig. 1). Note that signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is proportional to the square root of observation time (T) such that S/N increases with the observation time and the signal is more likely to be detected (see Section 1. 4 of Sieniawska &amp; Bejger, 2019, Universe 5, 217). This likeliness of detection is due to the increase in observation period and not due to the increase in sensitivity of the detectors. If S/N &GreaterEqual; 5, such a signal can be detected by a gravitational wave detector (see Section~2. 1 of Pitkin, 2011, MNRAS, 415, 1849).   (a) Poloidally dominated white dwarf.   (b) Toroidally dominated white dwarf Figure 1: Gravitational wave S/N as a function of integration time for a white dwarf with central density= 2 × 1010 g cm−3. The thick orange line corresponds to &lt;S/N&gt; ≈ 5. Gravitational wave astronomy is also helpful to resolve the dichotomy of some other objects too. There are some isolated compact objects, named soft gamma repeater~(SGR) and anomalous X-ray pulsar~(AXP), which are mostly believed to be neutron stars as they are found to be associated with supernova remnants. However, some of them do not have a supernova remnant association, and their magnetic field is also unknown. Hence, some researchers have also shown that some of their features can be explained assuming they are white dwarfs. To resolve this controversy, the researchers have shown that gravitational wave astronomy is also a helpful tool. It was shown that if they are neutron stars, no proposed gravitational wave detector can detect them. On the other hand, if they are white dwarfs, they can be detected by BBO and DECIGO detectors within 1 year of detection period. The exact time needed for the detection is dependent on the magnetic field configuration and its strength (Fig. 2).   (a) Poloidally dominated white dwarf.

For part (c), in the parentheses, the dominant magnetic field configuration in neutron star is mentioned. In this way, gravitational wave astronomy will be a useful tool to resolve dichotomy related to various compact objects.

    "title": "Most Extreme Stars",
    "body": "2021/12/12 -  A general article exploring some of the most extreme stars of the universe. Each one of them deserves the word ‘most’ for varied reasons. Just read and enjoy the mysterious cosmos sitting at home.  Introduction: The splendor of the night sky has fascinated mankind since time immemorial. The divine beauty of the numerous twinkling stars caught the attention of the human beings since the ancient historic periods. I was also not an exception. I have loved the stars since childhood days. I watch them, observe their properties, research some of them and also like to write about them. The stars are not only for the astronomers, it is for all of us. In fact, recent advances in astronomy have proved that – “we are all Star Childs. ” Yes, it may seem unbelievable to anybody who is not aware about astronomy, but it’s true that the elements with which we all and everything around us (like the chair, table, rockets, food, all animals etc. ) are made of, were once created inside the centers of the stars. There are as many different kinds of stars, as there are stars themselves, each an individual. The nature of these stars, understanding their properties and evolution tell us the story of our own existence - the birth and death of the Sun on which we all depend. So, once in a sky observation camp at Murguma, Purulia district, West Bengal of India during the chill cold nights of November, 2007, I suddenly started thinking about the most extreme stars – the record holders in the stellar worlds! Within a year, I collected the details of more than 100 of such stars. Let us discuss about some of them today. After much hard work of about a month, I have selected 14 of them to talk. Though these are my personal favorites, I am sure some of my favorites will become yours also. Enough of introduction, now let’s dive into the bizarre worlds of the most extreme stars and try to appreciate the immense range of sparkling night sky beauties that nature has to offer. Stars of Extreme properties: 1. ADHARA: The brightest ultra violet star of the sky known till now.   Fig. 1: AdharaImage courtesy: astropixels The Northern Hemisphere constellation Canis Major is mainly appreciated for the star “Sirius” – the apparently brightest star of the night sky. But just near it twinkles another second magnitude (visual mag:- 1. 51) star – Adhara. Situated at a distance of around 425 light years it marks the western foot of the mythical ‘Great Dog’ – Canis Major. Though we may neglect Adhara, but it is about 50 times further than Sirius – and still a bright second magnitude star. It is visually about 3700 times brighter than the Sun. But when we consider the ultraviolet radiation radiated from its surface, it is about 15,000 times brighter than our Sun! The radius of Adhara is about 13 times that of the Sun. It has left the main sequence stage and started its journey towards death. Combining these properties it has gained the status to be the brightest ultraviolet star of the sky as seen from Earth. So, if we could have seen in the ultraviolet band of the EM spectrum, Adhara would have been the brightest star of the night sky – not apparently but absolutely! 2. BARNARD’S STAR: The fastest moving star of the sky known Located in the constellation Ophiuchus and at a distance of 6 light years – Barnard’s star is one of the closest stars to Earth. Its visual magnitude is 9. 5 and is too dim to be observed by naked eye.   Fig. 2: Location of Barnard's Star, ca. 2006 (south is up)Image courtesy: Wikipedia As all the stars of our galaxy go around the Milky Way galaxy on slightly different orbits, their positions change relative to each other. Such motions are extremely slow andare known as the ‘proper motion’ of stars. These motions are so slow that they are just unnoted and their positions change over a time longer than the history of the printed world. But discovered in 1916 by E. E. Barnard, Barnard’s star moves across the sky at a tremendous speed of 10 seconds of arc per year. Over an average human lifetime, it will move by two – tenths of a degree – almost half the angular diameter of the Full Moon. This may seem incredibly small to anyone reading this article. But it is a celestial record!! Barnard’s star is the fastest moving star known till date. It will leave Ophiucus for Hercules (on its way to Draco) in about the next 3300 years. When translated to a linear scale, its speed is measured as 140 kms per second – about seven times the speed of an average star. We need a modest telescope and a good star map to observe this ‘Usain Bolt’ of the starry sky. Just try to watch it once. 3. CD - 380 245: The most metal poor star known Located at a distance of about 5000 light years in the Southern Hemisphere constellation ‘Sculptor’ this star was first catalogued during the ‘Southern Hemisphere’ sky survey during 1885 to 1930 at the Cordoba Observatory in Argentina. The catalogue of these stars is known as CD. Our star’s bizarre name CD – 380 245 means that it is the 245th star within the band that lies between 380 and 390 South ‘declination’ in the ‘CD’ catalogue. CD – 380 245 is a record holder due to one of its mind-boggling property. It is the most metal poor star known! Due to its extremely low metal abundance, it becomes difficult to classify this star in a spectral classification scheme. From its spectrum, its iron content is measured to be about ten – thousandth of that of the Sun! It is also one of the oldest known stars. The Universe was created by an event called Big Bang. It is thought that the Big Bang event created only Hydrogen, Helium and very less amount of Lithium. So, the first stars (i. e. the oldest stars) that formed after Big Bang should have very less metal content. But the point is - we do not find much of these types of metal–poor stars. The question is: where are these first generation stars? Thus, we see that CD – 380 245 not only holds a record, but points to a deep mystery. It is really one of those rare, very old stars whom you can call; hello, the stellar Grandfather! 4. ESO 439 – 26: The faintest known White Dwarf When low mass (0. 8 – 2. 5 Solar mass) or intermediate mass (about &lt; 9 Solar mass) stars die, their carbon–oxygen core become exposed. These end states of low and medium mass stars are called white dwarfs – as they are very hot (so, white) and of very small size (like that of Earth) with diameter of about 10,000 kms (so, dwarf). The density of white dwarfs are extremely large – one sugar cube size mass of a white dwarf will weigh a ton! These white dwarfs are by nature very faint. Generally maximum white dwarfs are spotted in near distances (as we cannot see them at great distances due to their faintness) like the disks of our Galaxy. Their average absolute magnitude is about 16. But our star – ES0 439-269, located at a distance of about 140 light years in Hydra constellation, has an absolute magnitude of 17. 4. This makes it the faintest known white dwarf less than one hundredth the apparent brightness of Pluto! But, just wait friends…May be it is the faintest – but not the coolest. As we may expect that the faintest white dwarfs will also be the coolest ones – not true for ESO 439-26. It’s surface temperature (4560K) is warmer than the current record of 3500 K (surface temperature) for a bit brighter companionWDO 346+246 – the coolest known white dwarf. So you see, our general assumptions about nature does not always hold. 5. Gamma – 2 Velorum: A double star with the brightest known Wolf Rayet star Also called ‘Ragor’, this star is located about 840 light years away in the constellation Vela. With a visual magnitude of 1. 78 it is visually about 11,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Moreover, it is a double star. The components take 76 days to orbit each other and are completely inseparable except by means of sophisticated interferometry. Its spectrum depicts that one of the component is a Wolf Rayet (WR) star. WR stars were discovered by French astronomers Charles Wolf and Georges Rayet in the nineteenth century. The most striking property of WR stars is that they do not contain hydrogen - the main content of any other type of main sequence star! WR stars are very hot, rare, extremely luminous, and superbly blue in color. They are also losing mass madly. The type of WR star which we are concerned is a ‘WC’ star. It is one of the two kinds of WR stars. WC stars shine the spectra of helium and carbon. Our Gamma – 2 Velorum consist a WC star. Its estimated surface temperature is around 50,000 K. Though it is brilliantly luminous in the visual band of the EM spectrum, its most of the radiation is in ultraviolet spectrum. If all the radiation is combined, this WC star (a component of the double star of Gamma – 2 Velorum) is around 50,000 – 1,00,000 times more luminous than the Sun!This is the brightest WR star known till date. The WC star has lost almost 20 - 30 times the mass of Sun since its birth and till loses mass at a rate of nearly a ten – thousandth of a solar mass per year. This rate is just horrific. It is around 1 billion (100,00,00,000) times the flow in the solar wind. This wind of the WC star carries out the carbon that was created through helium fusion. The carbon enriches the nearby stellar environment from where new stars may born in distant future. Just think a bit. We can see the primary process which ultimately forms new stars, then may be planets around it and then may be life timming in one of those distant future planets. This particular star thus gives us the flavor of star formation process to be witnessed. Moreover, this star is visible through naked eye from any place south of 400N latitude in the constellation Vela during any suitable time of the year. It is designated as ‘Spectral Gem of the Southern Skies’. 6. Geminga: A weird radio-quiet Gamma Ray pulsar A massive star (9 - 25 Solar mass) dies in a violent supernova explosion leaving behind a highly magnetized, extremely dense and small (around only 15 - 20 kms diameter) core made up of completely neutrons. This dead core is called a neutron star. It spins extremely fast (many times per second). As a neutron star spins, its magnetic axis wobbles. It radiates energy along this magnetic axis which is titled to its rotational axis. If the Earth is in the way of such a magnetic axis of any neutron star, then we receive a shot of energy or ‘pulses’ from that particular neutron star. This is why; neutron stars are also called “pulsars” . The magnetic fields of pulsars are about 100 million times that of earth’s magnetic fields. The pulsars spin so fast and energetically that they radiate not only in radio waves, but also in the optical, x-ray and even in high energy gamma-ray domains. These pulses originate from the magnetic fields through the energy of rotation of the pulsars. As pulsars become older, they lose energy and also pulses from top down. The high-energy gamma ray pulses first vanish, then gradually disappear x-ray and optical and at last they are left with only radio pulses.   Fig. 3: GemingaImage courtesy: ESA But every radio astronomer got shocked in the year 1973. In 1973, an object was found in the constellation Gemini which was a bright gamma–ray source. More precise observations showed that it is pulsing at x-ray energies with a period of 0. 237 seconds (4. 2 times per second). It was named “Geminga”. Located 800 light years away, the field of the sky showed few stars when photographed. After much tenuous research, one very dim star (visual apparent magnitude 25. 5) was identified as “Geminga”. The bizarre thing is that it is a pulsar which is radiating only high energy gamma rays and x-rays, not in optical and not even in radio! Its surface temperature is between 2,00,000-3,00,000 K and the age is estimated at around 3,40,000 years. It is the first known Gamma-Ray pulsar and extremely rare in its breed. Where are the radio waves? Is it really not emitting any radio emission? Or, is there something else? The answers to all these questions is,“Nobody knows”…Just think about “Geminga” which literally means ‘not there’! 7. HD93129A: Probably the most luminous star The Southern Hemisphere sky has a spectacular constellation (other than crux the Southern Cross) to watch-Carina. It contains Eta-Carinae: the most massive confirmed star in our Galaxy. Also it has another wonder not quite visible to the naked eye (visual magnitude 7. 3):- HD93129A - possibly the most luminous star of the Galaxy. This star is the luminary of a young dense cluster known as Trumpler 14 which is situated around 9000 light years away. It is a member of a binary system. Both it and its companion (HD93129B) is O3 star. Our star HD93129A, which is a supergiant, has an absolute magnitude of -6. 7. If it was as close as the bright star Vega, it would have been far brighter than Venus. The two stars are estimated to have an orbit of at least 50,000 years.   Fig. 4: HD93129AImage courtesy: windows2universe Now look for its luminosity. With surface temperature of about 52,000 K it pours most of its radiation in the ultraviolet range. Combining all types of radiation, it is around 25, 00,000 (2. 5 million) times brighter than Sun—somewhat less than Eta Carinae. But there is a catch. It has been revealed that about 1. 7 magnitudes of its radiation are absorbed by intervening interstellar dust between it and us. If this absorption would not have absorbed HD93129A’s radiation and considering the huge uncertainties in distance, it could in fact top Eta Carinae’s luminosity. Its birth mass may have been greater than 120 solar masses. To orbit this star and receive the same radiation as we receive from the Sun on Earth, out Earth would have to be at a distance of 1600A. U away from the star i. e. 40 times the distance between Pluto and Sun. If the companion B star was not there, this hypothetical earth would take about 4800 years to complete one orbit. Just think of a severe harsh winter of 1200 years with temperature falling well below -200 degree Celsius! 8. ETA CARINAE: The most massive known confirmed star in our Galaxy   Fig. 5: Hubble Space Telescope image showing Eta Carinae and the bipolar Homunculus Nebula. Image courtesy: Wikipedia Almost 8000 light years away in the constellation Carina lays a monster of the stellar world—Eta Carinae. One of the farthest visible naked eye star (apparent magnitude 5. 0), it is around 50,00,000 times brighter than the Sun and buried in a dense cloud of its own making (the ‘Homunculus’ nebula as it is called ). It is an extremely violent star which became brighter than Vega (app. mag-1) in 1840 due to a massiveeruption. Again shining to sixth magnitude in 1890, it faded away later and recently has become visible to the naked eye. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) revealed that the Homunculus is made of two oppositely moving (speed 400 kms/second) lobes nearly a light year across. They were created in the Great Eruption of 1840. The star’s terrific luminosity suggests a present mass of around 100 solar masses making it the most massive known confirmed star in our Galaxy. Modern observations in the nebular spectral lines also suggest a 5. 6 years orbit pointing to the fact that may be Eta Carinae is a massive binary star system. Current estimates tell that the “primary” star has a mass of around 80 solar mass and the “secondary” has around 60 solar mass. The two may have been born with 200 solar mass. Recently in 2010, a star named R136a1 has been discovered in the ‘Tarantula Nebula’ of our nearby galaxy ‘Large Magellanic Cloud’. It is estimated to have a present mass of around 260-265 solar mass and is thought to have been born with about 320 solar masses! Though it is under close scrutiny till now, if the mass revealed is true then this will be surely the most massive star known till now. 9. R LEPORIS: The sky’s reddest naked eye star Have you seen the constellation Lepus (the Hare) just below Orion? Perhaps some of you know it for the blazing globular cluster M79. But leave M79, Lepus contains a record holding star in it – R Leporis or Hind’s Crimson star discovered by J. R. Hind in 1845. It is a long period variable like ‘Mira’ changing its brightness over a long 430 days period by a factor of 300 (visual magnitude 5. 5 to 11. 7). Located at a distance of about 820 light years and still to be a ‘Mira’ type variable, R Leporis must be a cool giant. Cool stars are reddish (recall Betelgeuse, Antares). It is 300 times more luminous than the Sun. But as it is a cool star, it emits mainly in the infrared region.   Fig. 6: The superb red color of R LeporisImage courtesy: NASA There are two factors which contribute to its extreme red color. First it has exceptionally low surface temperature of about 2050K, making it one of the coolest giants known. Second, R Leporis is an arch ‘carbon star’. It is now a full blown carbon star. Injecting this carbon into interstellar space R Leporis is gradually forming a planetary nebula. Carbon molecules (mainly cyanogen) absorb a huge amount of blue light. So the more amount of carbon and the cooler the star, more and more blue light is absorbed. Thus, carbon stars are very red in colour. R Leporis, due to its extremely low surface temperature takes this redness to the highest limit. It is the reddest naked eye star of the sky!!Most of the carbon in our Galaxy seems to come from stars like this one. Every one of us is made of stellar dust which was parts of such long gone stars! 10. VV CEPHEI: The largest known star About 2000 light years away, in the constellation Cepheus lays a 4. 91 visual magnitude (absolute mag – 6. 75) M2 class supergiant star VV Cephei. It can dwarf any other known star in the sky due its massive size i. e. radius. It is the largest known star considering its radius. Being a part of a binary system its companion is a hot dwarf star whose spectral class is not properly known. Having a surface temperature of around 3,300 K, this super giant primary star VV Cephei has a luminosity of around 315000 times that of the Sun. From these properties, the radius of this star derived is about 8. 0 A. U i. e. 85 percent the size of the orbit of Saturn!!   Fig. 7: Size comparison of VV Cephei A with our SunImage courtesy: StarDate As it is a part of an eclipsing binary system, its companion dwarf star hides itself every 20. 2 years behind this M supergiant. These orbital studies predict the approximate radius of the supergiant M star to be 8. 8 A. U. Even a conservative analysis yields 7. 4 A. U. This grand supergiant’s size is roughly half the size of its companion star’s orbit! Both the stars are estimated to have 20 solar masses. VV Cephei is closely followed in the size race by another supergiant (this time a single, not binary) in the same Cepheus constellation: MU Cephei (also called Herschel’s Garnet star). It is the second largest known star with a radius of about 7 A. U i. e. 40 percent larger than Jupiter’s orbit. Its visual magnitude is 4. 1 and lies just a bit south of VV Cephei. So both the largest and second largest known stars of the sky can be seen through naked eye. 11. ACHERNAR: The flattest known star   Fig. 8: Location of Achernar in Eridanus ConstellationImage courtesy: astronomytrek The constellation Eridanus starting from just below the brightest star of Orion i. e. ‘Rigel’ is a large constellation with many famous stars. It stretches through the sky towards south and ends at a bright star named Achernar- the brightest star of Eridanus. Not only this, Achernar is also the flattest star known till date! Having an apparent magnitude of 0. 5 and at a distance of 143 light years it is rotating at a tremendous speed. This caused an appreciable equatorial bulge. Across its equator it is 55% wider than across its poles. Thus, the star’s equatorial regions are less dense and cooler than the areas near the poles. This phenomenon is called ‘gravity darkening’. Being a very bright star, it is easily observable through naked eye. This makes it a very rare celestial beauty- one of the very few stars in the sky with gravity darkening effect that can be observed easily with unaided eyes.   Fig. 9: Achernar: the flattest star knownImage courtesy: astronomytrek 12. SGR 1900 + 14: Ultra –Magnetic neutron star that ionized the earth’s atmosphere Looking at the beautiful sparkling stars far away from us, please do not think that they cannot create any harm to us from such huge distances. They can really reach us and show how excessively powerful they are- and how extremely helpless and insignificant we are compared to them!One such major caution came on August 27, 1998 at 10:22 Greenwich Mean time (i. e. 15. 52 P. M. IST) from a distance of about 20,000 light years in the direction of Aquila constellation. A newly formed pulsar is so dense that it develops a solid crust that re-adjusts as its rotation rate slows. The equator is bulged out due to its fast rotation. During this readjusting phase, severe star quakes take place releasing immense energy. The bursts of this power can be unbelievable. Some of these pulsars emit relatively low energy gamma rays that last about a hundredth of a second. Such pulsars are called ‘Soft Gamma ray Repeaters’ or in short ‘SGR’. SGRs are very rare – only four have been found in our Galaxy till now. Two of them, SGR 1806-20 and our one i. e. SGR 1900 + 14 are well studied. SGRs are not only neutron stars – they are radio quiet pulsars like ‘Geminga’. SGR 1900+14 carries pulses of period 5. 16 seconds. In 1992, theoreticians suggested that some supernovae can create neutron stars with unimaginable magnetic strengths, if conditions are correct. They are called ‘magnetars’. The more powerful the magnetic field, the greater the slowing down rate of their spin. The above mentioned two SGRs are actually magnetars with magnetic fields 500 billion times that of the Earth. They carry the strongest magnetic fields of the universe!!But the story does not stop here. On August 27, 1998 at 10. 22 GMT, the magnetar SGR 1900+14 blasted an immense amount of energy towards us - 500,00,00,000 (five billion) times the energy produced by Sun per second. The intense energy radiated from this tremendous outburst immediately saturated the electronics aboard orbiting spacecrafts. Also our atmosphere got terribly affected! The ionosphere we know about is at a height of around 85 kms from Earth’s surface during night time. During day, sunlight ionizes the air and as a result the ionosphere comes to a height of around 60 kms from Earth’s surface. The outburst from SGR 1900+14 drove the ionosphere from the standard night time level to its standard day time level! SGR 1900+14 is 20,000 light years away. If it would have been 100 light years away- the earth would have been shattered within seconds!SGR 1900+14 showed the gigantic powers that stars can posses. It also taught us- “Earth is not at all a safe place from the sudden dangers of deep space. ”So you see, the twinkling stars of the sky are not only mere dots, they can reach to us and even touch us!! 13. OGLE – TR – 122B: Smallest known main sequence star whose radius is measured Come to the southern constellation Carina again. Though not visible through naked eyes, it contains another star which is a record breaker among the stellar world. It is OGLE-TR-122B – the smallest known main sequence star whose radius is measured. Being a part of a binary system, this star was spotted by a sophisticated survey called OGLE i. e. Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. It has a radius which is only about 20% larger than Jupiter – around 1, 80,000 kms only (our Sun’s radius is 7, 00,000 kms). Its radius is about only 0. 12 times the solar radii and mass about 0. 1 solar masses. Thus, the average density is about 50 times that of the sun.   Fig. 10: Size Comparison of OGLE-TR-122B with our Sun &amp; JupiterImage courtesy: newscientist OGLE-TR-122B has a mass which is close to the lowest possible mass a star can possess for starting hydrogen fusion in its core. It is truly a ‘Little Master’ of the sky, so little that it is a record holder little one. 14. Epsilon Aurigae: The most unusual variable star system known Epsilon Aurigae (ε-Aurigae) is a star in the constellation of Auriga. It is one of the most mysterious variable star known till now. Traditionally known as Almaaz, Haldus or Al Anz, it is a completely unusual eclipsing binary system which consists of a F0 class supergiant star and a companion whose proper identity is unknown till now. This star is of utter interest due to the nature of its eclipse. Every 27 years, Epsilon Aurigae’s apparent visual magnitude (i. e. brightness) starts to drop down from +2. 92, and within a period of 640-730 days (about 2 years) the magnitude drops to +3. 83. Then gradually again the brightness starts increasing due to the end of the eclipse. Also within those 2 years of eclipse process, in addition to this eclipse, the system has a low amplitude pulsation with a non consistent period of about 66 days. Epsilon Aurigae is an easily visible naked eye star of the sky. But it was the German astronomer Johann Fritsch who first suspected it to be a variable star in 1821. Later observations of Edward Heis and Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander during 1842-1848 confirmed the fact. By their observations it was revealed that ε Aurigae did not just vary over a long period (640-730 days), but also experienced short term variations in brightness as well. We know that our Moon sometimes eclipses the Sun completely (Total Solar Eclipse). This eclipse time can be up to a maximum of 7 minutes and 29 seconds. But in case of Epsilon Aurigae, the companion object which eclipses the star goes on eclipsing it for a continuous 640-730 days. Also this unknown companion does not emit as much radiation (or light) as expected for an object of such a huge size which can eclipse a supergiant star for 640-730 days! Then what this companion object can be? What is its nature and properties?This unseen, unknown companion and the mysterious eclipse pattern of the star system have made this star the most unusual, debatable variable star of the sky. The distance of this system from the Earth is also a subject of debate, but modern astronomers place it about 2000 light years from Earth. This eclipsing component is the center for all attraction today. No one knows properly the nature of the eclipsing component. It emits very negligible amount of light and thus remains invisible to the naked eye. A heated region has been discovered at the center of this object. The last eclipse of ε-Aurigae started in the International Year of Astronomy: 2009. So, AAVSO (American Association for Variable Star Observation) started a project called Citizen Sky to observe and report the data of this star system. Trained participants also analyzed data while testing their own theories. It was a three year project funded by National Science Foundation which can shed light to the mystery of the star system. The eclipse ended on May 12, 2011. Data was submitted by around 400 observers all over the world.   Fig. 11: The dimming of Epsilon Aurigae with course of time after the start of eclipseImage courtesy: Wikipedia Many probable theories and hypothesis concerning the nature of this object have come forward. But till now the mystery remains an unsolved mystery. The true nature of the eclipsing component is still a matter of debate. Conclusion: After a journey through the bizarre stellar beauties, one can understand that they are not only tiny twinkling dots in the sky- all of them have a story to tell. Next time when you look towards a clear night sky studded with all these small dots, which we call stars, just think about their amazing powers, extreme size, devastating eruptions from them, unbelievable luminosities and so on. You will surely become quiet, speechless and feel an unearthly peace in mind. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. "

    "title": "Magnetic Field Measurements of the Solar Corona by Aditya L1",
    "body": "2021/12/07 -  One of the science goals of the Aditya L1 is to map the coronal magnetic field topology. The infrared channel of the VELC payload of the Aditya L1 is equipped with a spectropolarimeter to perform full stokes spectropolarimetric observations in the Fe XIII 1074. 7 nm line to measure the vector magnetic field. This article discusses the design and the working of the spectropolarimeter of the VELC. This article also discusses the challenges associated with the spectropolarimeter of the VELC, which are to optimize the data volume to be sent to the ground as no onboard data processing is planned, and the other is to account for the change in polarimeter characteristic due to mismatch in retarder rotation frequency and the length of signal detection time.  Aditya L1 is the first Indian space-based Solar observatory that will continuously observe the Sun to study coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, coronal magnetometry, origin, and monitoring of near-UV solar radiation. It is equipped with seven payloads. One of the payloads is Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC), developed by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) to study the diagnostic parameters of solar corona and dynamics and origin of Coronal Mass Ejections and magnetic field measurement of the solar corona. A coronagraph is a telescopic instrument that blocks the light of a star so that the nearby objects which would otherwise be hidden in the star’s glare be resolved. A solar coronagraph occults the bright solar disc to resolve the corona. The VELC is equipped with a spectrograph as a backend instrument. A spectrograph disperses the polychromatic light and records the intensities over a range of wavelengths called the spectrum. We study the properties of the spectrum to estimate the plasma parameters like velocity, electron density, temperature, etc.   Figure 1: A LASCO C2 Coronagraph. LASCO consists of three coronagraphs (C1/C2/C3) onboard NASA’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory satellite. Image courtesy: NASA The VELC is designed to record spectra simultaneously in three spectral lines at 530. 3 nm due to Fe XIV (green channel), 789. 2 nm due to Fe XI (red channel), and 1074. 7 nm due to Fe XIII (IR channel). It is a multi-slit spectrograph (4 equispaced slits) covering the FOV up to 1. 5R⊙, where R⊙ is the radius of the Sun. The IR channel is equipped with a polarimeter to carry out full Stokes polarimetric observations of the Fe XIII line. The polarisation of electromagnetic waves refers to the path or the locus of the electric field vector. If the electric field oscillates in a single direction, it is called linear polarisation. If the electric field rotates in a circular plane as the light travels forward, it is called circular polarisation. The plasma’s magnetic field information is encoded in the polarisation of the spectral lines via the Zeeman effect and the Hanle effect. The Zeeman effect is the splitting of the spectral line in the presence of an external magnetic field. The Zeeman splitting of the spectral line gives rise to three spectral components, 𝞼+, 𝞼-, and 𝜋 components, which are right circularly polarised, left circularly polarised, and linearly polarised, respectively. If the magnetic field is along the line of sight, in that case, only the 𝞼+, 𝞼- components are observed. If the magnetic field is perpendicular to the line of sight (LOS), all three components are observed as linearly polarised. Also, the separation between these components, an observable quantity, is directly related to the magnitude of the magnetic field. Hence by measuring the polarisation in spectral lines, we can estimate both the magnitude and the direction of the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere.   Figure 2: Subfigure (a) shows the break in the degeneracy between magnetic sublevels in the presence of an external magnetic field, and this break or split of the levels produces three spectral components (𝞼+, 𝞼-, and 𝜋). In subfigure (b), we see if the magnetic field is perpendicular to LOS, then 𝞼+, 𝞼-, and 𝜋 components are observed as linearly polarized. In the subfigure (c), the magnetic field direction is into the plane of the screen (i. e. , along the line of sight), therefore only 𝞼+, 𝞼- components are observed as right and left circularly polarized respectively. Image courtesy: Author The Hanle effect is observed when the splitting or separation between energy levels of a spectral line, in the presence of an external magnetic field, is less than or equal to the natural width of that line. The anisotropic radiation coming from the underlying photosphere or chromosphere gets scattered by the atoms in the upper layers like the transition region and corona (TR-corona). This scattering process leads to linear polarization of the emitted spectral lines. This is valid even when there is no external magnetic field. Now, in the weak magnetic field regions such as TR-corona (where expected field strength is 1 to 300 Gauss), there will be a modification of the scattering or linear polarization as well as rotation of the plane of linear polarization of the emitted lines. This effect of modification in the line polarization is called the Hanle effect. By measuring this change in the polarization of the lines, the weak magnetic field can be estimated in the TR-corona of the sun. As described above, we can estimate the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere by measuring the polarization in spectral lines. A polarimeter is an instrument used to measure polarization. A polarimeter consists of a polarization modulator and a linear polarizer/analyzer. First, the unpolarized light from the Sun enters the polarization modulator which changes the state of input polarization. Then the polarized light from the modulator enters the linear polarizer which cuts the intensity of light perpendicular to its orientation. Hence, we measure at the detector the intensity allowed by the linear polarizer, which in turn depends on the output from the polarization modulator, which in turn depends on the polarization state of the input light of the Sun. By measuring at the detector the output intensity of the incident light of the Sun through the polarimeter and knowing the characteristics of the polarimeter, we can estimate the input polarization.   Figure 3: Figure showing a Retarder acting as a Polarization Modulator and Linear polarizer acting as an analyzer. Image courtesy: Introduction to Spectropolarimetry The VELC polarimeter consists of a continuously rotating wave plate (RWP) followed by a polarizing beam displacer (PBD) as the polarization analyzer. The PBD produces two beams that are orthogonally polarized, which are simultaneously recorded by the detector. This setup is commonly known as a dual-beam polarimeter. The main advantage of dual-beam setup is to reduce the spurious polarisation, i. e. , cross-talk from Stokes I to Q, U, and V. The light enters the polarimeter setup (RWP + PBD), and a frame is recorded on the detector. Then RWP is rotated by an angle, and another frame is recorded. To measure the four Stokes parameters (I, Q, U, and V), a minimum of 4 such measurements, called samples, are required at different orientations of RWP. This is called modulation of the polarization state of light. One modulation cycle constitutes 4 samples per half rotation of the wave plate, so one complete rotation of the RWP provides 2 modulation cycles. Due to the limited number of photons in the solar corona, large integration times are required to build the required signal-to-noise ratio. Signal to noise ratio (SNR) is the ratio of the desired signal strength to the background noise level. When SNR is low, we need to add the signal for many time intervals (integration time), which adds up the signal and reduces or cancels the noise as the noise is assumed random. It poses several challenges concerning the polarimeter of the VELC. One of them is the increased data volume to be sent to the ground station as no on-board data processing is planned. The second is the change in the polarimeter characteristic. In typical polarimeters, first RWP rotates, then the detector frame is recorded, However, in the case of VELC, the RWP rotates, and the detector records independently of each other. There is a mismatch between the retarder’s rotation frequency and the length of the signal detection time, which causes a change in the characteristic of the polarimeter after one cycle of measurements. Nagaraju and the team discuss the above problems and suggest a potential solution to optimize the data volume and account for the change in polarimeter characteristics in successive modulation cycles. To optimize the data volume, Nagaraju and the team discuss the optimal efficiencies of measuring Stokes parameters as a function of the number of samples per half rotation (n) of the wave plate (RWP) and provide efficiencies when the retarder’s rotation frequency does not match the signal detection time. They find that efficiency slowly increases with an increase in the number of samples per half rotation of the wave plate. They find that the increase in efficiency of measuring Stokes I and Stokes U is close to 10% for the case of n=5 to n=95, for Stokes Q, it is about 8%, and for Stokes V, it is about 4%. However, as the number of samples per half rotation will increase from n=5 to n=95, the data size will proportionally increase, and this will offset any gains in efficiency. They estimate the data size of 3. 14 Mb per second for n=4 to 74. 19 Mb per second for n=95. Hence they suggest that the number of modulation steps or the samples per half rotation be chosen by considering the data volume and other measurement aspects.   Image courtesy: Original article Nagaraju and the team discuss the change in the elements of polarimeter characteristics with time to understand the effect of the mismatch between retarder rotation frequency and signal detection time. They model this change for the different number of samples per half rotation of the wave plate. They find a cyclical/periodic variation in the elements with time. They find that the larger the time difference between the retarder rotation frequency and signal detection time, the faster is the variation in the elements of polarimeter characteristics with time. Despite the significant variation in individual elements, the efficiency of measuring Stokes parameters does not change significantly throughout integration time. They suggest this change in the elements of the polarimeter characteristics can be taken into account through calibration. They notice that the elements corresponding to measuring Stokes Q and Stokes U vary two times faster than elements corresponding to measuring Stokes V. Hence, recording the calibration data to cover one entire cycle within which elements of polarimeter characteristics corresponding to measuring Stokes V complete one period of variation may suffice.   Image courtesy: Original article Hence, they find that the data volume can be optimized by choosing an appropriate number of samples per half rotation of the wave plate (RWP) without significantly affecting the efficiency of the Stokes parameters. The variation of elements of polarimeter characteristic with time is also addressed due to a mismatch between the retarder rotation frequency and signal detection time, and a potential solution is suggested.

    "title": "Identification of a new category of stars: stars in rare transition phase found",
    "body": "2021/12/03 -  Pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars evolve into the main-sequence (MS) phase over a period of time. Interestingly, we found a scarcity of studies in the existing literature that examine and attempt to better understand the stars in the PMS to MS transition phase. The purpose of this study is to detect such rare stars, which we named ‘transition phase’ (TP) candidates – stars evolving from the PMS to the MS phase. We identified 98 TP candidates using photometric analysis of a sample of 2167 classical Be (CBe) and 225 Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars. This identification is done by analyzing the near- and mid-infrared excess and their location in the optical colour–magnitude diagram. The TP candidates are found to possess rotational velocity and colour excess values in between CBe and HAeBe stars, which is reconfirmed by generating a set of synthetic samples using the machine learning approach.  Introduction: A clear night sky offers an ever-changing display of fascinating objects to see - the Moon, planets, stars, even a good number of star clusters and nebulae. Observing the night sky and studying it has a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. Modern science and present-day technology have certainly provided us the opportunity to view the universe in much depth, thus revealing the deep insights of different cosmic objects, which otherwise remained hidden from human eyes for centuries. We now have a pretty good understanding of the stars, their properties, and their evolution. It is known that the star formation of massive stars proceeds through well-studied, definitive stages such as the protostar and pre-main sequence phase, before reaching the main sequence. A protostar is a very young star that is still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud. The protostellar phase is the earliest one in the process of stellar evolution. For a low-mass star (i. e. that of the Sun or lower), it lasts about 500,000 years. In essence, this is the period of a star’s infancy. Next, Pre-main sequence (PMS) stars are those which are gradually attaining youth. Hydrogen fusion has not yet started in their cores, but the temperature is gradually rising. Loosely, we can say this is the child cum adolescent stage of a star. Later, when such PMS stars graduate to youth, we call them Main sequence (MS) stars. This is certainly the youth stage of stars where Hydrogen is fusing to helium in their cores, like our Sun.   Figure 1: On the left is a physico-mathematical model of the Be star Achernar, a main sequence star (Image courtesy: astronomytrek). The picture on the right captured by Atacama Large Millimeter array, is of HL Tauri, a pre-main sequence star. (Image courtesy: ESO). Pre-main sequence (PMS) stars evolve into the main sequence (MS) phase over a period of time. However, whether there exist stars that are in some transition phase between the PMS to MS stage remains an open question among astronomers. An understanding of the transition from the PMS to MS phase is vital to address the astrophysical aspects connected to disc dynamics and the rotation rate evolution of stars. Interestingly, a scarcity of studies is found in the existing literature that examines and attempts to better understand the stars in PMS to MS transition phase. This dearth of study naturally raises a few pertinent questions such as, ‘Why is such a scarcity in the studies of stars in the transition phase from PMS to MS?’ and ‘Which stellar parameter is a clear and definitive indicator to identify such candidates?’. In this context, we conducted a study in the work “Identification of emission-line stars in the transition phase from pre-main sequence to main sequence” to delve into such essential questions. Present Paper: Identification of emission-line stars in transition phase from pre-main sequence to main sequenceAim: As mentioned earlier, we found a scarcity of studies in the existing literature that examines and attempts to better understand the stars in the PMS to MS transition phase. The purpose of the present study is to detect such rare stars, which we named ‘Transition Phase’ (TP) candidates - stars evolving from the PMS to the MS phase. We identified 98 TP candidates using photometric analysis of a sample of 2167 classical Be (CBe) and 225 Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars. Both CBe and HAeBe examples of a rather uncommon class of stars known as ‘emission-line’ stars, which exhibit emission lines of several elements in their spectra. Emission-line stars: Stars usually show absorption lines in their optical spectra. However, there exist stars that also exhibit emission lines of different elements. Broadly known as ‘emission-line stars’, they belong to different categories such as T Tauri, Herbig Ae/Be, Of/ Oe/ Be/ Ae stars, Wolf Rayet (WR) stars, etc. Fig. 2 presents the representative spectra of one Be star HD 55606 showing different spectral features. A HAeBe star is an intermediate mass PMS star (between 2 and 8 times the mass of our Sun) with a gaseous disc surrounded by a dusty outer envelope (Waters &amp; Waelkens, 1998). On the other hand, a CBe star is a type of massive B-type main sequence star that is surrounded by a geometrically thin, equatorial, gaseous, decretion disc that orbits the star in Keplerian rotation (Meilland et al. , 2007). The existence of such a circumstellar, gaseous disc was first suggested by Struve (1931). One may read the article “Study of exotic Classical Be stars using optical spectroscopy” by Gourav Banerjee to know more about CBe stars and recent developments in the field of CBe star research.   Figure 2: Representative spectra of the star HD 55606 showing different spectral features in the wavelength range of 3800 – 5850 Å. Figure from Banerjee et al. (2021). The representative emission and absorption lines are indicated with arrows. Fig 3 shows the connection between absolute magnitude and spectral type of stars, which was not random but instead seemed to fall into discrete groupings, this figure is known as HR diagram or Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The enclosed regions in the illustration indicate the locations of various kinds of emission-line stars on the diagram. It is clear that emission-line stars are primarily concentrated in the region corresponding to early and late-type stars.   Figure 3: Distribution of different types of emission-line stars in the HR diagram. Figure is taken from Kogure &amp; Leung (2007). Brief summary: Some recent studies (e. g. Mathew et al. , 2008, Jamialahmadi et al. , 2015) presented convincing evidence that stars might possess an unseen and rare transition phase between PMS to MS. One reason why such stars remain unseen to date might be this: during the protostar and PMS phases, a star is usually surrounded by thick discs of dust and gas. This makes it difficult to observe such stars using ground based facilities. Mathew et al. (2008) studied 207 open clusters younger than 100 Myr and identified 152 CBe stars in 42 clusters. Interestingly, they also detected a few more stars that are situated in a region somewhere in between HAeBe and CBe stars in the near-IR color-color diagram. Fig. 4 presents the result which was observed by Mathew et al. (2008).   Figure 4: The diagram of 157 identified emission-line stars (open triangles) as found by Mathew et al. (2008). The known CBe stars (filled squares) and HBe stars (filled circles) are also shown in the figure. It is seen that a few stars are located in a region somewhere in between HBe and CBe stars. For representation purposes, the region containing the most concentration of CBe and HBe stars are marked with blue and red ellipses, respectively. The candidates which appear to fall in between these two regions are marked with a grey ellipse. This grey region constitutes stars which we termed as ‘Transition Phase' candidates. Then it was found by Jamialahmadi et al. (2015) that the star 51 Oph might be a probable example of this class of rare transition stars. According to them, ‘this star appears to be a peculiar source in an unusual transitional state’. This was the motivation for starting our ambitious research project. We analyzed a sample of 2167 CBe and 225 HAeBe stars. The main reason for selecting these two classes of stars is this: HAeBe stars are in the PMS phase, whereas CBe stars are in the MS stage. Hence, our selection helped us to detect those rare stars which are in the transition phase between HAeBe and CBe: meaning stars in between PMS and MS phase. Photometric analysis was performed on the sample of these HAeBe and CBe stars, which were obtained from the literature. Through developing machine learning and statistical technique and analysis, we were able to identify a sample of 98 stars evolving from PMS to MS phase (follow the paper for a detailed understanding of the methodology and analysis). This separate category of stars is termed as ‘Transition Phase’ (TP) candidates by the authors. They are likely to exhibit properties of both HAeBe and CBe stars. Interestingly, the detected 98 TP candidates are indeed found to possess rotational velocity in between CBe and HAeBe stars, which is reconfirmed by the machine learning approach. This provides compelling evidence that these stars might truly be passing through the rare transition phase between PMS and MS. Previous studies reported 14 among these 98 candidates to be HAeBe stars, whereas the other 84 were classified as CBe stars. We estimated the age and mass of 58 among the 98 TP candidates to be ranging within 0. 1-5 million years and 2-10. 5 times that of the Sun, respectively. However, the detailed properties of these newly identified stars are still unknown. Future Scope: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and also the largest study till date to detect and characterize TP candidates. Our study will motivate the community of emission-line star research about the significant need of detecting and studying TP candidates in more detail. Since the disc formation mechanism in CBe stars (known as the ‘Be phenomenon’) remains poorly understood after more than 150 years of CBe star research, identification and characterization of a larger number of TP candidates may shed new light on the evolutionary phases of various types of emission-line stars. We were unable to conduct a spectroscopic investigation on our samples since spectra are currently unavailable for the majority of TP candidates. As a result, we want to perform such a study for our newly identified sample of TP candidates in the future utilizing high resolution spectra. Spectroscopic investigations of TP candidates, as well as the comparison of their spectral features with that of CBe and HAeBe stars, will assist in the understanding of their disc characteristics.

    "title": "Technical aspects of VELC onboard ADITYA-L1: India’s first solar space mission",
    "body": "2021/11/29 -  This article is the review of a journal paper on the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph, the primary payload onboard India’s first solar space mission, ADITYA-L1. The paper discusses some technical details of VELC and the work done in analyzing them. This article is an attempt to introduce the reader to the instrument, its science and the content of the paper in a simplified manner.  ADITYA-L1 is an Indian satellite with seven payloads, planned to be launched next year. This satellite will not orbit the Earth; rather, it will be at the Lagrangian 1 (L1) point. The L1 point is the location in the Sun – Earth line where their combined gravitational pull equals the centripetal force needed for a small object to move with them. This will be India’s first space mission to study the Sun. The Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) is arguably the primary payload in this mission, and the paper under discussion here deals with characterizing certain technical aspects of VELC.   Figure 1: Illustration of the ADITYA-L1 satellite with its payloads. Credits: ISRO The VELC will observe the solar corona, which is the tenuous, outermost layer of the solar atmosphere. It will analyze the coronal temperature, plasma velocity, density, etc. It will also study Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and the solar wind. CMEs are large clouds of fast-moving plasma, formed by spectacular explosions in the corona, whereas the solar wind is a continuous stream of charged particles the Sun sends out to interplanetary space. The mesmerizing aurora (also called polar lights) are caused by the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth’s magnetic field. The details of VELC: The VELC consists of a coronagraph, spectrograph, polarimetry module and detectors, aside from auxiliary optics. A coronagraph is an instrument used to observe the very dim solar corona, by blocking the bright central disk of the Sun. Coronagraphs usually have a central occulter to block the light from the solar disk; like an artificial solar eclipse. This causes only the surrounding light from the corona to pass through the coronagraph and is available for further analysis or recording. In the case of VELC, instead of a central occulter, a mirror with a circular hole at its center is used to discard the disk light and reflect only the coronal light into the instrument. In general, coronagraphs occult not just the solar disk, but some of the surrounding regions also. This is to reduce the light scattered from the edge of the occulter. Here, the disadvantage is that we won’t be able to observe and study the lower corona, adjacent to the solar disk. For example, we say that the coronagraph field-of-view (FOV) starts from 2 radii of the Sun if it occults everything within a distance of twice the solar radius from the center of the Sun. The VELC will have the smallest occulting radius among coronagraphs, with the FOV starting from 1. 05 radii of the Sun. A spectrograph is an instrument that splits polychromatic light (consisting of multiple wavelengths) into its constituent wavelengths (spectrum). This is similar to a prism splitting white light into VIBGYOR – at different angles from the face of the prism, we get different wavelengths of light. In VELC, a component called grating is used to generate the spectrum. If in a prism, refraction causes white light to split into different wavelengths, in the VELC grating, reflection, diffraction and interference together create the spectra. The presence or absence of certain wavelengths in light and their relative amplitudes can be used to find out details of the source of the light and the medium through which it travelled. Thus, the spectrum gives us details of the solar corona. Next comes the polarimetry module. Polarimetry is the technique of understanding the direction of electric and magnetic fields associated with an electromagnetic (EM) wave. We know that light is an EM wave and that the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other, and they lie in a plane (say, Plane A) perpendicular to the direction of propagation of light. But these EM fields could be oriented in infinitely many perpendicular directions in Plane A. The electric field and magnetic field could be oriented North-South and East-West respectively, or they could be oriented North-East – South-West and North-West – South-East, just to mention two examples. Light is a collection of photons and different photons could have different orientations of EM fields in Plane A as described above. The orientation of the EM fields depends on the process that creates the photon and the environment in which it is created. In general, a source of light will be an equal mix of all these different processes, with the result that the generated light will have EM fields in all directions in Plane A. We say that all directions in Plane A are equally probable for the EM field, and we call the resultant light unpolarised light. Now, if the source of photons has an asymmetry, i. e. if the processes that create a particular orientation of the EM field are in abundance, and/or if the source environment (say ambient EM fields) aides the generation of EM fields in a particular direction, then the light we observe will have an abundance of EM field oriented in that direction; now the light is said to be polarised. The magnetic field in a region affects the polarization of light generated from that region, and thus we can calculate the magnetic field by measuring the polarization. Understanding the distribution of magnetic fields is crucial to our analysis of the solar atmosphere. Thus, this is one of the ways in which measuring the polarisation of light helps us study the solar corona. For measuring polarisation, the polarimetry module contains special optics called the polarisation modulator and analyser. The detectors in VELC are CMOS-based. The detectors in normal DSLR cameras are also CMOS based, with the difference that the VELC detectors have very low noise and are adapted for use in space. When light falls on the pixels of these detectors, electrons are generated by the photoelectric effect. Higher the intensity of light, the higher the number of electrons generated. When the detector is read out, the internal circuitry will convert the electron count in each pixel to a digital count. This is how an image is generated by a CMOS detector. The path of light through VELC: The light entering the instrument from the coronagraph is split into two, based on its wavelength. This is done by a Dichroic Beam Splitter (DBS) which reflects light of a certain wavelength while transmitting other wavelengths. The reflected light (wavelength &lt; 5100 Å) goes to a section called the continuum channel while the transmitted light goes to another section called the spectral channel. In the continuum channel, a filter is used to cut down the wavelength to 5000 Å ± 5 Å (ie. green colour light). This light is then focused on a CMOS camera and the image of the corona is recorded. In the spectral channel, the light transmitted by the DBS is focused on a multi-slit before it goes to the spectrograph. The multi-slit is a unique feature of the VELC. It consists of four slits parallel to and equidistant from each other. A slit is used to restrict not the intensity of light, but the region from which the light is originating. Thus, each slit will observe only a narrow strip of the region in the corona. A multi-slit with four slits will observe four different locations in the corona simultaneously. Now, by moving either the multi-slit or the focused image on the multi-slit, we can observe different parts of the corona; this is called scanning the field-of-view (FOV), and scanning is done perpendicular to the length of the slit. Compared to a single-slit setup, four slits take only one-fourth the time to scan the same (FOV). This means the VELC can do observations four times faster than a single-slit spectrograph. After passing through the multi-slit, the light falls on the spectrograph grating, where it is split into multiple wavelengths as a function of the angle of reflection from the grating. Three wavelength bands (5303 Å: cyan - green colour, 7892 Å: red - near-infrared, 10747 Å: near-infrared) are filtered from this section and each directed to a separate CMOS detector, where the spectra of the corona at that wavelength are recorded. The 10747-channel has a polarimetry module in front of its detector. Thus we can find the polarization of light from the 10747-spectra. Overview of the paper: Ritesh Patel and their team calculated the number of photons (photon count) and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) in all three wavelength bands in the spectral channel, for different exposure times, different widths of the multi-slit, different coronal heights, temperatures, etc. To calculate the photon count, we made use of the atomic database, CHIANTI. CHIANTI inputs environmental parameters like the temperature, electron density, etc. , and instrument parameters like the instrument’s full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) (which depends on the slit-width), spectral dispersion, etc. It then gives a distribution of the photon count as a function of the wavelength. The SNR is a measure of the goodness of a signal. Whenever we make an observation, in addition to our signal, we also get noise from the surroundings. This consists of signals from other sources and the internal noise of the instrument. SNR is the ratio of the strength (power or amplitude) of our signal to the strength of the noise. For example, SNR=1 means that the signal and noise levels are the same. If SNR &lt; 1, we say that our signal is embedded in the noise. In such a condition, it will be difficult to discriminate noise from our signal. Thus, a large value of SNR is always preferred. In the case of VELC, SNR is calculated by comparing the CHIANTI photon count with the photon count from simulated instrument scatter and noise. This is done for all three wavelengths in the spectral channel. A larger slit width means more photons and higher SNR, but a smaller exposure time for our detectors, since they can only observe a certain amount of photons before getting saturated. For the VELC 10747-channel, the exposure time is fixed. So based on this exposure time, the slit-width is optimized to achieve the required photon count and SNR. The CHIANTI spectra is also transformed into a multi-slit spectral image, one for each wavelength (Figure 4 in the paper). These are how the outputs of the VELC spectral channel will look like. In this particular case, the synthetic spectra are created for CME (Coronal Mass Ejection) data from the K-Coronagraph at Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO/KCor). So, in this paper, we calculated the slit-width to optimize the observations of the VELC. We also generated the synthetic spectra for a CME. The data we got here will help in setting up observation procedures of the VELC to perfectly capture CMEs and other dynamical solar events.

    "title": "Polarization of the light reflected from exoplanets: A new window into the study of exoplanets",
    "body": "2021/11/26 -  Polarization is an emerging technique in the field of exoplanets. Understanding the basic physics behind the polarization of the light observed from the planets can help us study them in detail. One such aspect is to study the polarization of the reflection from the exoplanets, which can tell us about their atmospheres, especially the clouds present in them and also, the surface features. Several big-budget missions are being planned for polarimetric observation of the exoplanets. Theoretical simulation and modeling of planetary polarization plays an important role in this regard as they help us decide the targets as well as prepare the roadmaps for those missions.  After the discovery of thousands of exoplanets, the scientists are on a desperate quest to arrive at new direct and indirect techniques to get a complete picture about the formation, dynamics and the atmospheres of the exoplanets. In that regard, polarimetric techniques have opened a new window into the study of the exoplanets by overcoming many of the limitations of the traditional techniques. Light is a wave of electric and magnetic fields. These waves oscillate at random direction perpendicular to the propagation of light. When light gets scattered by atoms, molecules or cloud particulates in the atmosphere or reflected by a surface, the waves oscillate in a particular direction. Then the light is called to be linearly polarized. An instrument called a polarimeter can measure the amount of polarization as it allows light waves oscillating only in a particular direction to pass. For example. if we watch the sky by using polarized sunglasses, we can see a change in the brightness of the sky at different directions. This is because of the fact that sunlight gets polarized due to scattering by the molecules and the dust particles in the atmosphere. Similarly, when planets reflect the light of the parent star, that light gets polarized. As a consequence, the reflected light of all the planets in the Solar system is polarized. So, we can leverage this property of light to study the reflecting exoplanets as well. Detecting light reflected from the exoplanets is difficult as the reflected light is feeble compared to the starlight itself and on top of that, only a small fraction of that reflected light is polarized. Moreover, in the case of planets that cannot be resolved from their host stars, the light from the host star contaminates the planetary light and the observable polarization in such a case can be as low as a few parts per million (10-6 order). As a result, detecting this polarization is extremely challenging. However, there are a few high-end instruments such as HIPPI, PlanetPol, POLISH, among others which are capable of detecting a polarization signal at parts per million (ppm) level. We have worked on a detailed theoretical calculation of the polarization observable from the Jupiter-like exoplanets. This will guide the existing instruments in framing observational strategies and will also help in the design of the future sophisticated instruments for detecting polarization from exoplanets. We published this work in the Astrophysical Journal (link given below). The projection of a 3D planet on sky facing us is a 2D disk (for example, the lunar disk) which is almost circular in shape. We developed a Python-based radiative transfer code (see Ref. 4) for the numerical simulation of the polarized intensity at each point on such a disk of a planet. We, then, calculated the total intensity by averaging this intensity over the disk, since we cannot resolve the planetary disk. The polarization of light from opposite hemispheres tend to be in opposite directions (see Figure 2). As a result, after disk averaging, the opposite polarizations tend to cancel out each other. This is why the disk averaged polarization from a star or a fully illuminated planet is close to zero. However, since the illuminated portion of the planetary disk varies with its phase angle (αorb; like when we see different phases of the Moon), the degree of polarization also changes. Polarization of the light reflected from a planet is maximum at half phases (αorb= 900 or αorb= 2700) and minimum at full phases (αorb= 00 i. e. when fully illuminated or αorb= 900 i. e. when fully dark). Another factor determining the degree of observable polarization is the orbital inclination (i) of the planet (angle at which we view the orbital plane of the planet; see Figure 1) i. e. whether the planetary orbit is at an edge-on view (transiting planets; i=900 ), or at a face-on view (i=00 ) or is at an intermediate angle.   Figure 1: Schematic diagram of a planet at an orbital phase αorb orbiting with an inclination angle i.   Figure 2: Intensity of the total reflected light and the polarized light (Q/I and U/I) in the visible wavelengths at different points of the partly illuminated face (orbital phase being 450) of the Exoplanet orbiting at face-on and edge-on views, two extreme cases of orbital inclination. Positive (greenish) and negative (bluish) polarizations produced at different longitudes tend to cancel out each other. The net non-zero detectable disk-averaged polarization arises because of an incomplete cancellation owing to the geometric asymmetry.   Figure 3: Predicted percentage of detectable disk-averaged polarization in the visible wavelength region and at different orbital phase angles of a cloudy exoplanet orbiting at different inclination angles. The polarization is constant with time if the planet is viewed face-on (i=00). For all other inclination angles, the polarization is maximum during the two half phases of the planet and minimum during the full phases i. e. , when the day (αorb=00) and the night (αorb=1800) sides face the observer. Unlike the traditional and popular methods such as Transit Photometry and Radial Velocity methods which can detect planets only if they are viewed almost edge-on, polarimetric method can detect and probe exoplanets orbiting with a broad range of orbital inclination angles. Hence, we can use this technique to detect exoplanets in future. Moreover, polarimetric studies can complement the other studies providing us with deeper insights into the structure of the atmospheres, especially about the clouds and hazes in the atmospheres as well as the surface features (for rocky planets) of the exoplanets. Using this powerful technique, we will be able to even detect liquid water on the surface of the exo-Earths in the future!

    "title": "The First Theoretical Model of the Near-Surface Shear Layer of the Sun",
    "body": "2021/11/24 -  It is well known that the Sun rotates differentially, i. e. its equator rotates faster than the pole. Not only at the surface, but the solar rotation profile also varies with the radius, which was discovered in helioseismic observation. This observation reveals an exciting feature close to the visible solar surface that the rotation profile of the Sun changes very sharply, which is named as Near-Surface Shear Layer (NSSL). In this work astronomers from ARIES and IISc have given the theoretical explanation for the existence of NSSL very the first time. They have used the thermal wind balance equation to explain the existence of NSSL.  The Sun, our life-giving star, has always been a star of many interests. Its importance for the living beings made many astronomers turn their telescope towards the Sun just after the advent of the telescope by Galileo Galilei. The early and regular observations of the Sun revealed the presence of dark spots, now known as sunspots, and 11 years of periodic variation in their number of appearances, popularly known as the solar cycle. The systematic observations of sunspots also show that the solar surface rotates differentially, which means the equator of the Sun spins faster than its pole. However, the internal rotation of the Sun has only been revealed after the helioseismology (technique of using sound waves to peek inside the Sun) era. Helioseismology has answered the many puzzling questions about the Sun while raising many questions about our nearest star at the same time. One of the crucial observations that helioseismology has made was the existence of the near-surface shear layer (NSSL).  The NSSL is the region very close to the visible solar surface, where there is a sharp change in the rotation profile of the Sun. The understanding of NSSL is crucial for the Sun, but it will also help us understand the other stars. Many researchers had indicated the presence of such a layer in the past based on solar surface observations but the real inference has been provided only after helioseismic measurements. Here in this work, researchers from ARIES, Nainital and IISc Bangalore have given the theoretical explanation for the existence of NSSL, for the very first time. Their study used the thermal wind balance equation, which tells about how the slight difference in temperature between solar poles and equator, which is called thermal wind term, is balanced by the centrifugal force appearing due to solar differential rotation. Now, the question is, why are they expecting the solar pole to have a slightly higher temperature? To understand this, we have to think about the motion of plasma blobs or convective blobs in the solar convection zone in which heat is transported by convection in the same way as it is transported in boiling water. Unlike boiling water, the Sun is rotating, and hence the upward moving blobs will experience Coriolis force. The effect of Coriolis force is zero on blobs moving along the axis of rotation (as in the case of a pole) and will be maximum when they are moving perpendicular to it (as in the case of the equator). Therefore, the heat transfer will be more efficient along the axis of rotation, leading to a higher temperature near the pole which drives the plasma from pole to equator. Another term is called centrifugal, which arises due to solar differential rotation driving the plasma in the opposite direction that is equator to pole. The temperature profile of the Sun shows a sharp decrease near the visible surface and authors have shown that the pole-equator temperature difference also decreases as we approach the surface. To balance these effects Solar rotation profile (centrifugal term) has to change sharply, giving rise to NSSL. Most scientists believe that this condition is valid only in the interior of the Sun, and it does not hold near the solar surface. In their work, the authors have shown that this belief actually holds near the surface as well. They have noted that if this condition is true near the solar surface it can explain the existence of NSSL which is inferred in helioseismology based observation.

    "title": "Twinkle twinkle little stars, should I wonder what you are? A brief account of variable stars",
    "body": "2021/11/21 -  Curiosity is what has driven mankind to observations of new phenomena. Every twinkling star in the night sky is definitely not due to the atmospheric refraction of earth. Rather, one might be looking at a variable star, each with a different origin story to tell. A study of variable stars enhances our understanding of the universe.  1. 	Introduction: One of the first nursery rhymes I might have been introduced to was the popular rhyme, “Twinkle twinkle little star”. Over the years, the verse took a different form once we were introduced to the astronomically correct idea of a star. Now the rhyme reads somewhat like below. Twinkle twinkle little starYou look small cause you are farLightyears out from here to thereYour light is distorted by the airSo you twinkle twinkle little star Elementary physics lectures have introduced us to the idea of atmospheric refraction, due to which observed starlight seems to vary in intensity. This phenomenon of twinkling is attributed to the varying densities of the atmosphere. However, not all twinkling stars attribute their twinkle to atmospheric refraction. Some twinkle due to their inherent properties. Such stars are called variable stars. The time scales associated with stellar evolution are generally so large that the Universe has been traditionally viewed as a static phenomenon. However, we have long known short human time scale events, such as Solar System events and stellar explosions. With the advent of robotically controlled telescopes and high cadence near all-sky monitoring in the last decade of the 1990s, the study of astronomical events on ever shorter time scales has exploded. With access to this new stream of data, our understanding of many phenomena has increased significantly. However, the number of unanswered questions have increased multiple times. One such question addressed the dilemma of why many celestial bodies varied in their brightness. This led to the study in the field of Time-Domain Astronomy and variable stars. 2. 	Time Domain Astronomy: Time domain astrophysics is a field of observational astronomy that studies the universe on all timescales from less than milliseconds to more than decades and at all wavelengths. This became possible due to the availability of great detectors and computing advances over the past decades. The idea of observations and analysis have now moved beyond the one-off photographic surveys in the past. Beginning from the 1990s, the MACHO(massive astrophysical compact halo object), OGLE(Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment), and SuperWASP projects used large field of view, highly sensitive cameras on manual or robotic optical or near-infrared telescopes and obtained deep digital images of large swathes of the sky. These scans were repeated to build up vast databases of time-resolved images. If we were to describe the elementary ideas of time-domain astronomy, we could explain it in the following manner. Observe a particular section of the sky. Note the physical limits visible in that section. After some time t, observe the area under consideration. If any of the physical quantities have changed from earlier, we tag the particular body in the database for future study. The time it takes for the instrument to re-observe the same patch of sky is referred to as the “cadence. ” The old strategy of looking deep and far into the Universe is used, and sources of a given brightness methodically mapped out in a three dimensional volume. In time-domain astronomy, sources that vary by some brightness with a rate equal to the inverse of the instrument cadence can be steadily mapped out. In a way, the time-domain adds another dimension, given by the frequency equal to the inverse cadence, to the properties of observed phenomena. The study of variable stars is an essential section of time-domain astronomy. 3. 	Variable Stars: Omicron Ceti was the first variable star to be identified in 1596 by David Fabricius. Johannes Holwards observed Omicron Ceti pulsating in a regular 11-month cycle in 1638. This discovery debunked the theory that the stars were eternal and invariable as ancient philosophers such as Aristotle had believed. Variable stars change in brightness over time. These changes can vary from as small as a few parts in a million or by a considerable factor. The changes observed can also range from a few milliseconds to a few years or decades, for that matter. Since many astronomical bodies can qualify as a “variable star”, an array of techniques are devised to discover and analyse the possibility of a variable star. The next obvious question is on the importance of studying variable stars. The study is of importance as the variations provide unique insights about nature, the origins, evolution and often the future trajectory of the star under observance. This information helps us deduce more fundamental knowledge about our universe. The variations may be due to the rotational motion executed by a spotted star, or due to a star being eclipsed by its companion star, or even by an unseen planet. The variations may also be due to the vibrations of a star. If these vibrations are complex, we might be able to get a rough picture of the internal structure and composition of this star. The variations may be due to eruptions on a star (flares), or an accretion disc (dwarf novae) or major explosions on a star (novae), or to the total disruption of a star in a supernova. Supernovae are one of the most violent incidents in the known universe. However, the existence of life is an indirect result of supernovae. They help to recycle the atoms created in stars into space. Some of these atoms became part of the Sun, others into planets, and for that matter, even the biosphere. It is deduced that the elements heavier than iron were mostly created in the supernova explosion. Supernovae may be dramatic and extreme, but they represent only one of the many roles that variable stars play in modern astrophysics and in our understanding of the universe and the processes which govern it. The organised study and recording of observations led to the establishment of the Variable Star Section of the British Astronomical Association (BAAVSS) in 1890, followed soon after by the establishment of variable star studies at Harvard College Observatory, which eventually led to the founding of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) in 1911. 4. 	Classification of Variable Stars: The General Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS) recommends an official classification system of variable stars based on:  Light Curve Temperature Luminosity Population typeBased on this system, a family tree of variable stars can be constructed. Such a tree is called a Variability Tree. A simplified version of the variability tree is given below.  Figure 1: Variability tree, denoting the various classes of variable stars. The image can be found here. The variable stars are classified into two groups based on the reason of variability in the observed intensities, Intrinsic and Extrinsic variable stars. They are further categorised into sub-classes, which are discussed below. 5. 	Intrinsic Variable Stars: Intrinsic variable stars vary their light output, hence their brightness, due to the physical variation in the star or stellar system. This type of star provides a large amount of information about the internal structure of the star that helps astronomers to model the stellar evolution. Pulsating stars and eruptive or cataclysmic variable stars belong to this category. 5. 1. 	Pulsating Variable StarsPulsating variables are the stars that show periodic expansion and contraction of their surface layers. The change in brightness occurs due to the change in size or shape. Most of the pulsating stars simply expand and contract repeatedly in a continuing cycle of size changes and this is known as the fundamental mode of pulsation. Some of the changes not only in their size but also in their internal arrangement of material. Some others vibrate in more than one way at the same time and this makes the system complex. Like most vibrating systems, pulsating variables repeat their changes and they tend to be periodic. Depending on the period, on the mass and evolutionary status of the star, pulsating variables are classified into many categories. We shall discuss each sub-category briefly. Cepheid variable starsCepheid variables form an important class of pulsating variables. These are large yellow stars pulsating with periods from 1 to 70 days, with an amplitude of light variation from 0. 1 to 2 magnitudes. They are very bright objects and have periodic oscillations. Cepheid light curves are distinctive and show a rapid rise in brightness followed by a more gradual decline that is shaped like a shark fin. The spectral class of Cepheid actually changes as it pulsates, being about an F type at maximum luminosity and down to G or K at minimum. Cepheids follow a period-luminosity relation. Period luminosity relationship states that ‘more luminous cepheids pulsated more slowly’. This concept was put forward by Henrietta Leavitt in 1912. The period of cepheid can be calculated from its light curve which can be used to estimate the Cepheid’s luminosity. Knowing its magnitude and luminosity we can calculate the distance using the relation m - M = 5 log(d/10) where m is the apparent magnitude, M the absolute magnitude and d the distance to the star in parsecs.   Figure 2: Light curve of cepheid Delta Cephei. The image can be found here. Long-period variables: One of the largest population of pulsating variables are the long-period variables (LPVS). They are pulsating red giants or supergiants with periods ranging from 30 to 1000 days. Long-period variables are further subdivided into two major subclasses, the Mira type and the semiregular variables. a. 	Mira variableThese are periodic red giant variables that vary with periods of 80 to 1000 days in magnitudes as high as 2. 5 in the visible bands. Mira type variables are red giant stars, often of enormous size. Their high luminosity means that they can be detected at large distances. Many of them are slowly ejecting a steady stream of matter into the surrounding space and this mass loss has dramatic consequences on their future evolution. They have weak outer layers in their atmosphere which gets heated from regular pulsations. These are interesting due to their similar size as the Sun and that they are undergoing a late stage of the same evolutionary path that all one-solar mass stars, including the Sun, will experience. b. 	Semi-regular variableSemiregular variables are giants or supergiants which show appreciable periodicity accompanied by semiregular or irregular light variation. Their periods range from 30 to 1000 days, generally with amplitude variations of fewer than 2. 5 magnitudes. RR LyraeRR Lyrae stars are of short period (. 05 to 1. 2 days), pulsating white giant stars, usually of spectral class A. They are older and less massive than Cepheids. The amplitude of variation of RR Lyrae is generally from . 3 to 2 magnitudes. RV Tauri StarRV Tauri stars are yellow supergiants having a characteristic light variation with deep and shallow minima. Their periods, defined as the interval between two deep minima range from 30 to 150 days. They show brightness variations of up to 3 magnitudes. Some of these stars show long term cyclic variations from hundreds of thousands of days. Generally, their spectral class ranges from G to K.   Figure 3: Light curve of RV Tauri star R Scuti. Image courtesy: Wikimedia commons 5. 2. 	Cataclysmic variable stars: Eruptive variables are stars varying in brightness because of violent outbursts caused by thermonuclear processes in their surface layers. They exhibit significant and rapid changes in their luminosity which is usually accompanied by mass outflow in the form of stellar winds of variable intensity. These are a system of two stars (binary system) orbiting very close to each other. One of them is a normal sunlike or giant star, while the other is a white dwarf. Some of the outermost material from the larger star is pulled away by the white dwarf’s gravity, but this material does not fall directly onto the white dwarf. Instead, it builds up in a disk called an accretion disk, which orbits the white dwarf. Thus, the eruptive variable star is a combination of normal or giant stars, white dwarf and accretion disk as shown in the following figure.   Figure 4: A cataclysmic variable star. The image can be found here. The combination of main-sequence or giant stars, white dwarf and accretion disk lead to celestial fireworks. So, instead of varying like pulsating variables, eruptive variables exhibit outbursts of activity. Some events may result in the destruction of the star while others can reoccur one or more times. These are called recurrent novae. The changes in their light curves are usually very unpredictable and tend to be sudden and dramatic. 5. 3. 	Supernovae: Supernovae are examples of such cataclysmic variable stars. These occur either during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion. The original object(progenitor) either collapses to a neutron star or black hole or gets destroyed. We will now look briefly into the types of supernovae. Type I supernovaeThese do not exhibit any hydrogen lines in spectra. Type Ia supernovae are understood to arise from white dwarf stars in a close binary system. As gas from the companion star accumulates on the white dwarf, the white dwarf is continuously undergoing compression. At the Chandrasekhar Limit, the white dwarf has accumulated too much mass to resist the force of gravity, thus setting off a runaway nuclear reaction inside. This leads to a cataclysmic supernova outburst. Type Ia supernovas are employed as “standard candles” to measure cosmic distances because they are believed to blaze with equal brightness at their peaks. Hence, they can be used as standard candles to determine the distance to a galaxy once the stretch factor is accounted for. Type II supernovaeA pre-requisite for a star to explode as a Type II supernova is that the star must be several times more massive than the sun (around 8 to 10 Msolar). Once the core of this star runs out of hydrogen and then helium at its core, it moves ahead with the nucleosynthesis process to create heavier metals. As a result, heavier elements accumulate at the centre, similar to a layered onion. Lighter elements are found in the outer regions of the star. Once the star’s core becomes heavier than the Chandrasekhar limit, the star begins to implode. This is why these supernovae are called core-collapse supernovae. Eventually, the core starts to heat up and becomes denser. The implosion bounces back off the core and expels the stellar material into space, forming the supernova. Type II supernovae show hydrogen lines in their early spectra. 6. 	Extrinsic Variable Stars: Extrinsic variable stars are those in which the light output changes due to some process external to the star itself. The two main classes of extrinsic stars are the eclipsing binaries and rotating variables. 6. 1. 	Eclipsing binariesEclipsing binaries are binary star systems whose members eclipse each other, blocking one another’s light. As a result, the system looks occasionally fainter to observers on earth. The light curve of an eclipsing binary depends on the sizes and brightness of the stars, their separation from each other and the geometry of view from the earth. The process of eclipsing and the corresponding light curve of an eclipsing system is shown in the figure below.   Figure 5: Eclipsing binary star. The image can be found here. 6. 2. 	Rotating starRotating variables are rapidly rotating stars, often in binary systems, that undergo small amplitude changes in light due to dark or bright spots on the star’s surface which is much similar to sunspots on the sun. Stars with sizeable sunspots show significant variations in brightness as they rotate. Stars that have ellipsoidal shapes also exhibit variation in brightness when they present varying areas of the surface to the observer. 7. 	Conclusion: Curiosity is what has driven mankind to observations of new phenomena. Every twinkling star in the night sky is definitely not due to the atmospheric refraction of earth. Rather, one might be looking at a variable star, each with a different origin story to tell. A study of variable stars enhances our understanding of the universe. Cepheid variables help in determining distances to galaxies and determining the age of the Universe. Mira variables help us in making an understanding of the future evolution of the Sun. Accretion disks in cataclysmic variables help us to understand the activity inside active galaxies with supermassive black holes. Type Ia supernovae have helped us conclude on the accelerated expansion of the Universe by acting as a standardisable candle. Transiting extrasolar planets provide clues into the processes of planetary formation.

    "body": "2021/11/18 -  The focus of this article is solar wind. I first take the reader through the theory &amp; observations, and various properties of solar wind. Then, I take a detour through machine and deep learning which form the basis of our work. Finally, I take the reader through our work on predicting, and investiagting sources of solar wind using deep learning.  Note: This article was originally given as a talk to the students of the Astro club of Fergusson college, Pune on 24 August 2021 . The night sky is one of the most primal sources of curiosities for many living creatures - more so for humanity. If you live in a village/town without the glaring lights and pollution, you can see the beautiful night sky dotted with stars, and possibly also the majestic Ganga of the heavens1. In the backdrop of these stars which follow regular paths in the sky lie the wanderers, who seem to move like kids in a park. Though these wanderers (or Planets, as we know them now) seem to move here and there, they also move in periodic paths that can very nearly be predicted. However, humans would see very different objects once in a while- sometimes with a tail of smoke, sometimes falling to the Earth, and sometimes as a guest star. These apparently unpredictable events would cause panic in people, and lead to associating such events with ‘good’ or ‘bad’ omens. One such class of objects which have long been observed, and feared by humans is the comets. Many thousand years have passed since, and now we know what these comets are (and hopefully given up on the superstition!). These are rocky balls covered with dust and ice which orbit the Sun in highly eccentric orbits. This means we see many of these comets extremely rarely – for instance, we can see Halley’s comet only once in 76 years2! In Fig. 1, an image of the comet Hale-Boop is shown. This image came in as an Astronomy Picture Of the Day. You will notice that by and large the comet has two general parts – a “nucleus” and a “tail”. The nucleus is the core, rocky body of the comet, while the tail is the fuzzy smoke-like stream coming out from the nucleus. As you will further notice, there are two tails for this comet. These tails are the white “dust” tail and the blue “ion” tail. If you draw a line connecting the Sun and the comet’s nucleus, the ion tail points directly away from the Sun, while the dust tail lags a bit. This observation was not missed by astronomers in the 1940s and 50s, and many sought to explain why this was the case. Then, in 1951, Ludwig Biermann proposed that while the dust tail comes due to the nucleus getting hot (so ice simply evaporates), the ion tail comes due to charged particles hitting the comet (Biermann L. , 1951).   Fig. 1: Dust and Ion Tales of Comet Hale-Bopp. Credit &amp; Copyright: John Gleason APOD 27/12/2000. This was a rather startling proposition. Remember, just a little over 50 years prior to this paper, Michelson and Morley had shown that interplanetary space is empty, with no matter. Then where would these charged particles come from? In 1958, Eugene Parker at the University of Chicago submitted a paper to The Astrophysical Journal on “Interplanetary gas and magnetic field”. He had asked the question: what happens to a star like the Sun, with a hot atmosphere3, as we move away from it? Parker had found that the atmospheric pressure pushes the atmosphere into a wind of particles, streaming across the solar system, and into the interplanetary medium. He called this the solar wind. Now, there was no shred of evidence yet for such a large scale wind (remember, Biermann had only hypothesized - science needs evidence4), and the referees5 rejected the paper while not finding any particular fault with it! But the journal’s editor was Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar - the man who had theoretically, among other things, predicted that a white dwarf can be stable only within a certain mass limit now called the Chandrasekhar limit (Venkataraman G. , 1992). Chandrasekhar found Parker’s paper to be well done mathematically, and hence overrode the referees to publish it (Arnab Rai Choudhuri, 2014; Parker, E. N. , 1958). Parker predicted quantities like velocity and pressure of the solar wind. He also performed a calculation of how the magnetic field of the Sun would look like in the solar wind. He found that the field lines would be buffeted in an Archimedian spiral, shown in Fig. 2. In 1959, the Soviet probe Luna 1 was launched with experiments to the moon. However, it performed measurements across the interplanetary space and found signatures of these high speed particles coming from the Sun. Thus, observationally, the hypothesis of the solar wind was validated! Fig 2: The “Parker Spiral”, taken from Eugene Parker’s original paper. Image source: Parker, E. N. , 1958 This caused an explosion of science on the solar wind. Then, sometime in the 1990s, the spacecraft Ulysses was launched to study the Sun from its equator to its poles. It tried to associate, on average, the source of the solar wind on the Sun. This observation is shown as the complicated Fig. 3, with an image of the Sun in the background, and the solar wind speed measurements as the lines. To read this plot, imagine that you are moving on a circle around the Sun’s image. The smaller your circle (closer to the Sun), slower is the wind – larger your circle, the faster the wind is. Ulysses found that the solar wind that comes approximately from the equator is slow - less than 500 km/s - and highly variable. The solar wind coming from the poles is much faster, peaks at around 700 km/s, and is quite steady. This observation suggested that the solar wind comes in two modalities - slow and fast.  Fig. 3: Overlay of SWOOPS solar wind speed and EIT/LASCO/Mauna Loa images of the solar corona. Image credit: ESA This opened Pandora’s box. Scientists started tackling these observations with two questions:  What are all the differences between the fast and the slow wind? Which regions in the Sun give rise to the two wind modalities? What physical processes give rise to the two wind modalities?Meanwhile, scientists found some clues on all the differences and which regions in the Sun give rise to the two modalities. First, both the winds have quite different compositions. This is an extremely technical topic for a later day, but it is enough to know that different ions are present in different proportions in the slow wind. But what about the “source regions” of the solar wind? In Fig. 4, I show the results obtained by Wang and Sheeley in 1990. They studied areas on the Sun called Coronal Holes (Wang and Sheeley, 1990) (henceforth, I call them CHs), which are seen as dark structures in the solar corona, and represent regions where magnetic field lines are open. Wang and Sheeley found that the fast wind speed showed variations similar to the CH area. So they hypothesized that the fast wind comes, at least in some measure, from CHs.    Fig 4: Solar wind speed and Coronal hole area comparison across the solar cycle. Notice that as CH area increases, the wind speed increases, and so on. Image courtesy: Wang and Sheeley, 1990.  The slow wind, on the other hand, is very tenuous. David Brooks and collaborators measured the composition of the solar corona, and attempted to narrow down on the origin of the solar wind (Brooks D. et al. , 2015). Brooks and others found that the Active Regions (ARs) boundaries show composition similar to the slow wind, and conjectured that the slow wind comes from these regions. The ARs are bright, complex structures that consist of numerous closed loops of magnetic field, holding hot plasma. However, in 2019, the Parker Solar Probe observations showed that the slow wind seems to come from CHs near the equator (Bale S. et al. , 2019). These are shown in Fig. 5. In summation, these observations showed how we could find potential sources of the solar wind by mapping the “wind properties” to “solar coronal properties”.    Fig. 5: Left: Slow wind from Active region boundaries by Brooks et al 2014. The blue image is an example of the solar corona, with the bright areas depicting the ARs. The red and green patches show the slow wind sources. Right: Equatorial Coronal hole . The region marked “Perihelion” is the location of the Parker Solar Probe, and the corresponding dark patch below is the potential source region. Image courtesy: Bale S. et al. , 2019 . Meanwhile, I and collaborators (or rather, my mentors!) were studying a slightly different problem. We were trying to develop a model that can predict what the solar wind measured near Earth, given coronal data. Since we don’t know the exact locations of the sources of different solar wind modalities, we were trying to understand how best we can circumvent this problem and automatically figure out the solar wind given an approximate source region. What inspired us? Artificial Intelligence (AI). When we started our work, we were at the cusp of rapid development and revival of machine &amp; deep learning algorithms. AI is a cool word that generally makes us think of Ultron, Jarvis, Transformers, or even the robot TARS from Interstellar. But in reality, it is a broad term for a set of algorithms that can ‘tune’ and ‘learn’ from the data. A simple example is shown in Fig. 6. What you see here is a game, like Need for Speed. Generally, a player controls the steering and throttle of the car, ensuring it stays in lane (or at least follows a trajectory). Fig. 6 is similar, except that the throttle and steering angle are adaptively ‘learned’ by an AI as we keep feeding in the car images at each instant. The core idea is similar to what is employed by self-driving cars. How cool is that? Fig. 6: A game showing the motion of a car along a road. No human is playing this game -- rather, a machine learning algorithm is predicting what the steering angle and throttle are, given each frame. Image Credits: Sergios Karagiannakos We interpreted from such development that the core idea behind such self driving car setups is to consider a time series of images, and generate a set of real values. The AI automatically figures out what the car is, where the car is, how fast it is moving, and so on. The AI does this by “predicting” the throttle and steering angle, matching the actual needed throttle and steering values, and iteratively reducing the error. Think of it as studying for an exam - you attempt to practise tests, and sure you will not get all the questions correct. But as you keep studying, you will keep learning more and more, and keep getting better and better. But what has this got to do with the Sun? We figured out that we study the Sun simply through a bunch of “images” of the Sun, while the solar wind speed is just a bunch of real values. And so, the solar wind speed prediction is pretty much complimentary to getting self-driving cars moving correctly! We then went ahead, and developed a complex AI called “WindNet”, which takes in images from the Sun and puts out the solar wind speed as a prediction. The WindNet showed pretty good performance – in fact, it was much better than the heuristically used models, and could predict 5-7 days in advance! This was a pretty cool result for a model which has no physics as input – we did not quite tell the model where the solar wind comes from! Till now people have asked what the solar wind is like, if you give an intelligently guessed region on the Sun. But our work has shown that we can ask the reverse question: with an AI which can predict the wind speed, can we ask which regions on the Sun it thinks are important for wind speed prediction? We asked an AI, trained purely on data, and not fed in with any physics, to answer a physics problem. Will it replicate known physics, or will it answer garbage? The first question we asked our model was: Where does the fast wind come from? The answer is shown in Fig. 7. The AI thinks that CHs are important for a fast wind prediction, and that too four days before prediction. This was pretty cool – we have seen that the CHs can give rise to fast wind, and the time taken to reach Earth is within the time frame of fast wind travel time! Fig. 7: The fast wind prediction, with the solar image on top, and importance map in the bottom. Blue corresponds to less important regions, while red corresponds to more important regions. Image courtesy: Author. Next, we asked our model: where does the slow wind come from? The response is shown in Fig. 8. The AI thinks that the ARs are important slow wind sources 5-7 days prior to prediction. This is in line with the observation of Brooks and collaborators. However, our AI also thinks the CHs are just a teensy bit important for the slow wind prediction. This is in line with the observation of Bale and collaborators. This was very interesting to us - AI systems have the potential to figure out the sources of the solar wind, without explicitly feeding in any physics mapping! How cool is that! Fig. 8: The slow wind prediction, with the solar image on top, and importance map in the bottom. Blue corresponds to less important regions, while red corresponds to more important regions. Image courtesy: Author. Finally, we evaluated this result statistically. That is, for all CHs, and all ARs, if one looks at this average importance, does it quite conform to known physics? Technical details apart, we found that the fast wind association to CHs was seen clearly by AI, with even the timing coming correct. However, while the slow wind showed strong relation to the ARs, the timing was quite wrong. This tells us that AI presents a potential way of studying the Sun, and the connection between Sun and Earth. However, it also needs to be perfectly trained to generate the mapping, and needs as much data as possible. This is a new era we enter, with the assimilation of AI with physics to generate models, target specific tasks, and even do good science. Let us take a giant leap forward in a quest to figure out the secrets of the Universe, aided by AI!

    "body": "2021/11/16 -  Prof. Thanu Padmanabhan, one of the stalwarts of theoretical physics, and a shining star of the Indian scientific community, left his mortal abode on the 17th of September this year. With a stellar career spanning over four decades, he has been immortalized through his contributions to advancement of theoretical physics and cosmology. In this article, Dr. Karthik Rajeev brings out the essence of some of Prof. Padmanabhan’s seminal works - ranging from the formation of cosmological large scale structure to the interface of quantum mechanics and gravity.    Thanu Padmanabhan (10 March 1957- 17 September 2021) Thanu Padmanabhan, fondly known as Paddy, was an internationally acclaimed Indian theoretical physicist, whose research works are spread across a variety of topics in gravitation, quantum theory and the study of our universe. Progress in theoretical physics happens in two different, but equally important, ways. The first corresponds to significant advances achieved using existing theoretical frameworks, while the second corresponds to, what may be called `paradigm shifts’. Padmanabhan’s immense contributions to physics have been on both of these fronts. About 300 papers in refereed international journals, about 10 books and numerous other articles that he has authored, spread over about four decades of his monumental career, is a testimonial to the impact he made in the field. In 1977, a 20-year-old Padmanabhan started his research journey by investigating the interaction between gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves. The results of his mathematical study were published in the reputed journal Pramana, while he was still an undergraduate student at University College, Trivandrum. Little did his friends and colleagues know that this was only the start of a stellar career of one of the brightest and fastest thinkers of our time. We shall now briefly glance through some of his contributions in the decades that followed.  It should be mentioned that the following `summary’ does not faithfully cover all of Padmanabhan’s contributions. This article is only an attempt to explain, in simpler terms, a few of his works that have influenced the author the most. When the Quantum meets Gravity: Quantum mechanics and the general theory of relativity are two of the foundational pillars on which theoretical physics, as we understand it today, is built. While quantum mechanics offers an efficient approach to understand physics at the smallest scales, general relativity furnishes the most satisfactory theory of gravitational interaction at our disposal today. Recall that according to our current understanding, there are four fundamental interactions in nature: the strong nuclear, the weak nuclear, the electromagnetic and the gravitational interactions (see: Fundamental interaction). A thorough understanding of the first three forces is essential to describe physics at the subatomic to the molecular level. On the other hand, while studying physics at these scales, theoretical physicists often ignore even the existence of gravity and get away with it quite safely! However, the effects of quantum mechanics are quite significant at these smallest scales. Hence, any sensible theory that attempts to describe phenomena at these levels must respect the principles of quantum mechanics. Fortunately, we have a remarkable model to describe the strong nuclear, weak nuclear and electromagnetic forces that incorporate quantum theory, namely, the Standard Model of particle physics (for a recent visual description of the Standard Model, see this link). Then the question arises: What about gravity?. It turns out that quantum mechanics does not play any significant role in the gravitational interactions that, say, govern the dynamics of our Solar system. This is true even for gravitational interactions at much larger scales, say galaxies, galaxy clusters and so on. Does that mean that we should not bother incorporating quantum theory into our models of gravity? The answer is NO! The reason is that there are scenarios in nature where both the effects of quantum mechanics as well as gravitational interactions are believed to be equally significant. One such scenario occurs, for instance, when we consider physics at the very early stages of our Universe. There is a simple trick that physicists use to decide whether a physical scenario demands a quantum theory of gravity. The idea is to check whether the typical length, time and energy scales of a given physical situation is comparable to a set of constants called the Planck length, Planck time and Plack energy, respectively. The reason this works is because the aforementioned Planck quantities are defined solely in terms of the fundamental constants c (the speed of light), h (the Planck’s constant) and G (gravitational constant) (see this link for further information). Recall that Planck’s constant (h) corresponds to quantum mechanics, the speed of light ( c ) to relativity and the gravitational constant (G), of course, to gravity. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the Planck quantities (constructed with h,c and G) correspond to quantum theories with general relativistic gravity! Now, imagine the very early stages of the universe, say, just after or during the Big-Bang, when our universe was extremely `tiny’. During that era, the typical length, time and energy scales are believed to become comparable to the corresponding Planck quantities, hence signaling the need for a quantum theory of gravity to explain the physics at that time. A similar argument can also be made for the extremely dense interior of a black-hole, indicating that quantum gravity effects might be relevant there as well! Therefore, a quantum theory of gravity (translates to “a consistent model of gravitational interaction that incorporates principles of quantum mechanics”) is crucial to understand nature deeply. Unfortunately, however, one of the major challenges in theoretical physics today is to combine the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, into a coherent quantum theory for gravity. The reason gravity has not been tamed this way is primarily because it is not simply a `force’ in the conventional sense. To better understand what makes gravity different, let us briefly review how gravity is described in Einstein’s general theory of relativity (GTR). Einstein taught us that spacetime– the union of space (the ‘where’) and time (the ‘when’)– is the most natural construct to base our understanding of gravity. When there is no matter, spacetime is quite uninteresting and ‘flat’, say, like a flat rubber sheet. The presence of matter introduces non-trivial geometric features on the spacetime, somewhat analogous to how placing a heavy ball on the rubber sheet stretches it.  Gravity, it turns out, is just a manifestation of such geometric features of spacetime. The geometry, in turn, can be mathematically described by a quantity called metric tensor. Imagine the metric tensor as an object that tells us two basic pieces of information about the spacetime: ‘distances’ between two nearby points and ‘angles’ between intersecting lines in the spacetime. Einstein’s famous field equations determine the precise manner in which metric tensor behaves in the presence of matter. On the other hand, in the absence of gravity, physicists usually consider the other interactions to play out in a flat background spacetime, much like how dancers (forces and particles) perform in an inert stage (spacetime). However, the presence of gravity has the consequence that the spacetime itself is dynamic! (Imagine the stage itself performing with the dancers!) To combine quantum mechanics with a realistic theory in which the spacetime itself is dynamic is a major challenge that theoretical physicists are facing even now. In the 1980’s Padmanabhan, along with his supervisor Prof. Jayant V Narlikar, made significant progress in tackling this challenge. An ingenious idea that was the key to some of their works was to consider a simpler scenario in which the dynamic content of gravity is captured by only a ‘piece’ of the metric-tensor, called the conformal factor. Roughly speaking, what this simple scenario meant was that they considered only the distance-providing piece of the metric tensor to be dynamic while restricting the angles to be ‘fixed’ (Recall that metric-tensor gives us ‘distances’ and ‘angles’ in spacetime. ). It turns out that this piece of gravity can be combined with quantum theory in a relatively straightforward way. Therefore, they could perform several calculations that would have been difficult or even impossible in attempts towards a ‘full’ quantum theory of gravity.  Although their model might sound simple, it leads to important insights about the structure of the universe and spacetime in general, of which here we shall briefly look at only two. Before going into the insights that emerged from Padmanabhan’s and his collaborators’ studies, we have to understand certain basics of our universe’s past. There is irrefutable evidence now that our universe is expanding at an accelerated pace. What this implies is that if we imagine the evolution of our universe as a movie and play it in reverse, we would expect that the universe is contracting. Now, using the principles of general relativity and the assumption that our universe is made of reasonably realistic matter content , this thought experiment leads to the fact that the universe must have emerged from a single point in the past! Such a point is technically called a singularity and, in physics, the presence of such singularities signifies potential deficiencies of a theoretical framework. It is generally believed that a quantum theory of gravity would cure this problem. One of the important insights that emerged out of the works of Padmanabhan and Narlikar was that this belief is in fact well-founded.  For instance, one of the outcomes of their simple model was that the singularity at the beginning of our universe may be absent when quantum theory is considered! This might be viewed as a strong indication that a more complete quantum theory of gravity may also have the cure for singularity. Another result that came out of their studies was that the distance between two points in spacetime cannot be made arbitrarily small, instead, there could be a lower limit called ‘zero-point length’. This is quite counter-intuitive because our intuition is that as we bring two points closer and closer, the distance between them eventually becomes zero! The reason for the breaking of our intuition is that quantum effects potentially modify the structure of spacetime at the smallest length scales. In fact, it is found that the presence of `zero-point length’, or something resembling that concept, is a universal feature in several approaches to a quantum theory of gravity. This later motivated Padmanabhan and his collaborators to also investigate the implications of the ‘zero-point length’ in several other important contexts in theoretical physics, which eventually led to many useful physical insights. The grand design of the cosmos:  The formation of large scale structures in the universe is probably the problem requiring a solution in cosmology. — Thanu Padmanabhan At sufficiently large scales, our universe is quite homogeneous and isotropic. It is important to understand what one means by sufficiently large scale. To understand this better, let us consider a very large white sheet of paper. When looked at with naked eyes, the paper looks the same no matter at what point on the paper we are looking and which direction we are looking. But, if we zoom in using a powerful microscope, we will see that the paper is made of a network of microscopic plant fibres, which are arranged to form a uniform flat sheet at scales visible to our naked eyes. Of course, if we zoom in further, we will also find that the fibres themselves are made of cells, which in turn is made of molecules and so on. Similarly, in our universe, the stars are organized into galaxies, which in turn form galaxy groups that form galaxy clusters. These clusters are then arranged into filament-like structures, sheet-like structures and so on. Such large structures are separated by immense voids, hence creating a somewhat foamy texture to our universe, at a very large scale. Just as a paper looks homogeneous to us at scales greater than, say, a few millimetres (although it consists of intricate microscopic plant fibres), our universe is homogeneous at scales much greater than a few hundred million light-years (although, at smaller scales, it consists of several structures like galaxies, galaxy clusters, filaments etc. , at various levels). The fact that the universe is quite homogeneous at sufficiently large scales and at the same time has elaborate structures at smaller scales provides us an important clue about the state of our universe when it was much younger. Scientists believe that in the very early stages of our universe, the density of matter must have been remarkably uniform (hence, the large-scale smoothness we observe today!). However, there must also have been very small variations in this density, as we move from one place to another in the universe. The large scale structures in our universe, that we described earlier, are believed to have formed due to the gravitational field of such density fluctuations. However, the precise manner in which these `primordial’ density fluctuations led to the formation of large scale structures is still not completely understood analytically. Efficient computer simulations have been developed by several scientists and collaborations to make progress in understanding this problem. Although such simulations are helpful in making concrete predictions, they often do not provide us with clear physical insight. To gain more insight one needs a greater analytical handle. According to Padmanabhan: “This is important since some people in this field use computers the way a drunkard uses a lamppost - for support, not illumination. ” Padmanabhan contributed significantly to this direction by employing a wide range of tools in theoretical physics, which include, in particular, statistical mechanics. For instance, although the problem of cluster formation itself, in its entirety, is difficult to study analytically, Padmanabhan proposed a simple model in which one can divide the process of formation of structure into three convenient regimes. Each of these regimes was defined such that they could be independently dealt with reasonable analytical ease. He then proceeded to show how the results, in the three independent regimes, can be carefully combined to make predictions that are in good agreement with those from computer simulations. Such an approach shed more light on the underlying physics that drives the structure formation. Cosmological constant and the microstructure of spacetime: Observations show that our universe is expanding at an accelerated rate. The current accelerated expansion, in turn, seems to indicate that our universe is uniformly filled with a rather strange kind of energy called ‘Dark Energy’. Unlike other kinds of matter and energy, dark energy seems to create a sort of repulsive force at large scales, which tends to accelerate the expansion of our universe. It turns out that the effect of a uniform distribution of dark energy is mathematically equivalent to introducing a certain fundamental constant to Einstein’s field equations of general theory relativity. In this picture, dark energy is viewed as the manifestation of a new fundamental constant for our universe, called the cosmological constant. Moreover, to best explain the current observations, the cosmological constant must be a very small positive value, in a suitable unit. On the other hand, according to the principles of quantum field theory (QFT), which is another pillar of theoretical physics, the ‘vacuum’ has a certain energy content and this energy has the same effect as that of a cosmological constant. I should caution that the term ‘vacuum’ technically means the lowest energy state of a system. Moreover, due to quantum effects, the ‘vacuum’ in QFT, unlike the vacuum in the English dictionary(vacuum = a space entirely devoid of matter), has a richer structure. Consequently, the vacuum, according to QFT, must have a certain energy which is referred to as the ‘vacuum energy’. Since this vacuum energy also has an effect similar to the introduction of a cosmological constant, a certain fraction of the observed value of the cosmological constant must be the contribution from the vacuum energy. The problem, however, is that theoretically, this contribution seems to be gigantically larger than the observed value of the cosmological constant! This embarrassing disagreement between the observed value of the cosmological constant and the theoretical value of vacuum energy is referred to as the cosmological constant problem. According to Padmanabhan, to resolve the cosmological constant problem, one must start by admitting that at the deeper level, spacetime is not the fundamental object describing gravity. Spacetime and gravity, according to Padmanabhan, must emerge from more fundamental microscopic structures. This is similar to how a large number of microscopic H2O molecules interact to form the emergent fluid that we call water. He also claimed, with compelling reasons, that a deeper theory of gravity should be sensitive to only the fluctuations of the vacuum energy, instead of the vacuum energy itself. In this framework, one should identify the cosmological constant with the fluctuations of the vacuum energy, instead of the total vacuum energy itself, which we already saw was gigantically large.  This furnishes a compelling approach for resolving the cosmological constant problem, which is still being seriously explored by many researchers across the world. Note that fluids, which is an example of emergent phenomena, are described to some extent by a set of equations called the Navier-Stokes equations. Moreover, the presence of microscopic structure also implies that one can ascribe thermodynamic properties to these fluids. These thermodynamic quantities, in turn, must also satisfy certain thermodynamic identities. On the other hand, we have already seen that the dynamics of spacetime is described by Einstein’s field equations. To summarize, while emergent objects are characterized by certain kinds of features and related equations, gravity (or equivalently spacetime) is described by, what seems like, a totally different kind of equations. How does one reconcile this with the fact that spacetime (gravity) is emergent? Padmanabhan and his collaborators showed that Einstein’s general relativity itself already contains strong evidence for the claim that spacetime is emergent. For example, they showed that when Einstein’s equations are suitably reformulated, it takes the form of the Navier-Stokes equation! In addition, in a different setting, Einstein’s equations also acquire the form of thermodynamic identities! They also demonstrated that this is a feature of a larger class of theories of gravity that are extensions of Einstein’s general relativity. This, clearly, can be considered as a strong hint of the emergent nature of spacetime and hence, gravity. This raises the deeper question: If spacetime is emergent, like say water, what is its microscopic structure, analogous to how water consists of microscopic H20 molecules? In his last decade, Padmanabhan had constantly considered this question, the answer to which would revolutionize physics forever. He also believed that the difficulties with combining quantum theory with gravity primarily arise because one usually assumes spacetime as the fundamental variable to describe gravity, while it is actually only an emergent variable. The answer to the above question could also lead to the simultaneous resolution of two of the most fundamental challenges in theoretical physics: (1) formulating a quantum theory of gravity and (2) the cosmological constant problem. If experimental and theoretical confirmation of Padmanabhan’s revolutionary perspective on gravity emerges in the future, it would mark the third significant paradigm shift in our understanding of gravity, following Newton’s law of gravitation and Einstein’s general theory of relativity!

    "title": "What is CosmicVarta?",
    "body": "2021/11/13 -  CosmicVarta is a team effort where we all come together to discuss astronomy and related tools and ideas. Come join us on this journey!  Astronomy is truly a global subject. The boundaries between nations, people and ethnicities do not exist for astronomers. Astronomers and astrophysicists strive to study the cosmos in the hope of understanding and realizing our place in the Universe. Thus it is the responsibility of astronomers to convey what is found in our studies to the general public. Many news platforms and science popularization websites do a wonderful job of letting the public know about the final results from a few studies that are carried out in certain reputed astronomy institutes. But a vast majority of exciting research that is done in many universities and institutes throughout India never come outside of the scientific community. Professional astronomers give a detailed description of all their studies including how it was conducted and how they came to conclusions about astronomical objects from their studies in peer-reviewed scientific journals. But these articles are written in a highly scientific language and it is full of jargon. This makes the content incomprehensible to not only the interested reader but also to novice students who are not dealing with the subject on a day-to-day basis. But we want every interested individual to have a glimpse of the exciting life of astronomers. To do so we have started this platform to connect all astronomers and astrophysicists in India with the general public. Here, researchers will explain the work that goes on in their laboratories or in their research area (not just the results but how the conclusion was reached, what happens with all the data that is obtained from satellites and telescopes, why do we build bigger and better instruments et cetera) in a non-technical language. While we can make videos and explain what we do, we need to acknowledge that not everyone is comfortable in front of the camera, but what every PhD student/researcher is comfortable with is writing. Thus, through CosmicVarta, we intend to present the content published in scientific journals in a simplified yet detailed way so that people from every background can grasp the essence of the results. Articles on CosmicVarta can even help students understand the concept in a non-technical way before they go on to read the original article published in scientific journals. We also plan on publishing interviews with eminent professors and scientists as well as students working in the field of astronomy and astrophysics all over India. Thus prospective students can use this platform to find guidance and understand what to expect when entering this field. Apart from positions in astronomy and astrophysics in prominent research institutions, research in astronomy in India is carried out in various state, central and deemed universities as well. Through this portal, prospective students may also find information regarding them. This platform will also serve as an information hub regarding various software and databases that are available to be used by the public for free. The idea of CosmicVarta was found to be interesting by a wide variety of people we discussed with which indeed is very encouraging. We want to thank all the researchers who have contributed to the website by writing about their own papers or papers in their field before we even went live! We request all our readers to connect with us and even share their ideas for improving the platform. We also request all researchers involved in astronomy and astrophysics in India to write about their work and contribute towards popularizing astronomical research. Finally, and most importantly, just join us on a journey that will take you to the wonderful world of stars, galaxies, and beyond; and feel enthralled by the unlocking of the keys to the mysteries of the universe which scientists are doing on a daily basis.
