    "body": "We are cosmic varta team. Here our mission will be posted, alongwith our motivations. This is the personal profile for all the people too. We should use hyperlinks to link back to our personal pages/social media profiles wherever available. Our story: We all are Ph. D students at various institutions in India. We are united by our love towrds astronomy and the need to communicate the research to the general audience. (Add some more text here…) The members: Alow us to introduce ourselves ;)   Anusha R: Im Anusha. I’m currently working as a research project assistant at CHRIST (Deemed to be University). My research mainly focus on emission-line stars in general relating line properties, formation mechanism, statistical analysis depending on stellar parameters and the circumstellar environment, their disk physics. I am currently working on spectroscopic analysis of Disk forming hot stars and photometric analysis of the effect of binarity on the disk properties. Personally, I like to watch crime thrillers a lot. I’m a classical dancer and love to write.   Gourav Banerjee: I am Gourav Banerjee, pursuing PhD in stellar astrophysics at the Christ (Deemed to be University). My area of research is stellar spectroscopy, especially observational studies of emission-line stars such as Classical Be (CBe) and Classical Ae (CAe) stars. My PhD thesis aims to study (using optical spectroscopy) the variability (both transient nature and V/R variability) of selected CBe stars and also understanding the disc parameters of Galactic field CBe stars as a continuation of my MPhil thesis. Moreover, I have remained involved with other projects on similar fields such as the first systematic study to identify and characterize CAe stars (paper published in MNRAS), identification and characterization of CBe stars in open clusters older than 100 Myr (paper circulated), first ever identification of emission-line stars in transition between PMS &amp; MS phase (paper circulated), etc. Astronomy outreach is anothe field which I love from my heart. I am associated with astronomy outreach activities across Bengal and other parts of India for the past 26 years. My hobbies are reading books (mostly Bengali literature, history, and popular science) and exploring remotest places of India and abroad (sadly that is halted now).  And yes, I am a Voracious EATER. . food and books give me pleasure, astronomy provides me mental peace.   Ketan Rikame: I am a PhD student at Christ (Deemed to be University). Field of Instrumentation has always fascinated me and it has been my primary research interest. However, while working with various astronomy instruments, I also got interested in learning about underlying physical phenomenon these instruments try to study. I have previously worked in optical and radio instrumentation. I am currently part of the instrumentation team at RRI and we are building an X-ray polarimeter approved to be launched on a ISRO’s dedicated satellite mission XPOSAT. I also study accretion powered pulsars which will be one of primary scientific target of our X-RAY polarimeter. I am very much interested in science popularization. Although not involved in any such activity right now, I love to talk to people about my research (and not bore them hopefully :sweat_smile:). I also love to listen/read about to fascinating research other researchers are doing. I also love football :soccer:.   Lakshitha Nama Mahesh: Hello. My name is Lakshitha Nama. I am a PhD student at Christ (Deemed to be University). My PhD research aims at understanding the relationship between magnetic field and the elemental abundances in the outer atmosphere of Sun and other main sequence stars. I make use of imaging and spectroscopic data from X-ray telescopes. My hobbies including reading and painting.   Vivek Kumar Jha: Hi everyone. I am Vivek. I am a Ph. D student at ARIES, Nainital. My research so far has been about understanding the inner regions of active galaxies.  My PhD thesis is aimed at resolving the inner (sub-parsec) regions of these objects through multi-band observations and infer the structure and kinematics of matter in those locations.  I am also interested in exploring the various all-sky surveys which provide huge amounts of data to be accessed publicly. When not doing research, I usually go trekking in the neighbouring mountains or spend some time listening to classical music.

    "title": "Deciphering The Mysteries of The Quiet Sun Explosions",
    "body": "2021/08/17 - The outer atmosphere (the corona) of the Sun poses a long standing mystery regarding its tem-perature.  The solar corona is composed of plasma (ionised gas) that emits strongly in X-rays andultraviolet radiation.  Its temperature exceeds a million degree kelvin, while the visible surface (thephotosphere) is at 6000K.  One of the theories to understand the so-called ’coronal heating prob-lem’ proposes the occurrence of a large number of small scale explosions (known as microflares andnanoflares) on the Sun.  It is known that these flares are a manifestation of the magnetic field of theSun that is generated in its interior.  Fig. 1 - Caption to this image can be used like this But the Sun’s magnetic field is not constant, it varies with anaverage period of 11 years, which is known as the solar cycle.  Approximately every 11 years, the Sun’smagnetic field reverses.  In other words, the north pole becomes the south pole, and vice versa.  The flip of the poles is an end product of the slow evolution of Sun’s magnetic field over time.  As the cycle progresses, all of the Sun’s activities related to its magnetic field (such as sunspots, flares, coronalmass ejections) builds to a maximum (when the magnetic field reverses).  Then the Sun settles backdown to a minimum, before the whole cycle starts again.  The Sun was in a very low state of activityduring the minima of solar cycle 24 covering the year 2019.  It was in fact the quietest the Sun has been in the last 100 years! During this quiet period of the Sun, at the mid of the year 2019, Chandrayaan 2 was launchedwith the several instruments/payloads to observed our moon and the Sun.  Among them CLASS is aninstrument to understand the abundance of elements present on the moon. But this requires knowledgeof the X-rays emitted from the Sun.  Thus, the orbiter also carried an instrument called Solar X-rayMonitor (XSM). XSM observed the Sun during its deepest minima of solar cycle 24, covering the year2019-2020 with a good temporal and energy resolution.  Using observations during this time, SantoshVadawale and his team has uncovered some fascinating information about the quiescent Sun.  Theyhave shown that during this period small scale transients, so-called microflares (smaller counterpartof the conventional solar flares) are occurring everywhere on the solar disk. Solar flares are eruptions of electromagnetic radiation of all wavelengths from the Sun.  They lastfrom a few minutes to a few hours.  Flares are classified depending on the energy they release during its peak in the soft X rays.  Though the number of large flares increase with the progress of thesolar cycle, this study suggested that small flares, called microflares, keep exploding on the Sun at alltimes.  Though the definition of microflares has varied though the years due to the sensitivity of theinstrument, in this study flares having a peak flux below 10−8W m−2are considered as microflares. During this period of extremely quiet solar corona when no active regions were present on the disk,Santosh Vadawale and team identified a total of 98 microflares from 76 days.  The microflares aremarked in the lightcurve (Figure 1).  Most of the microflares were seen to behave similar to largerflares having a fast rise and a slow decay.  Some microflares did not follow this behaviour possibly1due to blending of multiple microflares or they intrinsically have a different origin.  The temperatureand emission measure of these microflares are determined.  Temperature tells how hot the plasma getsduring the explosion while the emission measure gives an idea about the density of plasma emittedat that particular temperature.  The temperature is found to be between 3-6 MK and the emission measure is in the order of 1046cm−3. The XSM microflare locations are identified in the extreme ultraviolet images obtained fromNASA’s ‘Solar Dynamics Observatory’ and from the X-ray images obtained by the Japanese HINODEX-ray Telescope. Most microflares were seen to be associated with X-ray Bright Points. ‘Solar Dynam-ics Observatory’ HMI magnetograms were used to analyse the corresponding photospheric magneticfield.  They observed the microflares to be associated with magnetic bipolar regions having weakerfield strengths, which indicates magnetic reconnection happening at smaller scales (Figure 2). This is also the first statistical survey of X-ray microflares outside active regions.  By plotting thefrequency distribution of microflares, the team has given evidence for the hypothesis that small scaleheating events occur everywhere on the Sun and they contribute to coronal heating.

The boundaries between the nations, people, ethnicities do not exist for astonomers. We all think of the entire humankind as one. However, India is a country where astronomy is equated wih astrology by even the well educated individuals. This itself is a paradox, as the Indian civilsation has a rich history of astronomical observations and calculations (expand). It becomes necessary and a responsibility for profesional astronomers to present a platform where the authentic research being carried out is presented and discussed in language which a ‘non-expert’ individual can understand. Moreover, while high quality research is communicated through the reputed journals, the students who are not dealng with he subject on a day to day basis might find it diiffuciut to grasp. We present CosmicVarta as an online platform where we simplify the current astronomical research being carried out so that people from every background can grasp the essence of the results. We are a group of Ph. D students, who all are working towards our doctoral thesis and through this platform, we want to share the astronomical research being carried out by the Indian astronomers scattered all over the country. Another area where we’d like the users to utilize this platfomr is: career guidance in astronomy. Research in astronomy is pursued at only a handful of research insitututes, hence prospective studens may often find it challenging to find relevant information. Through this portal you may find information regarding the various career optiona available, various positions available at astronomy institues in india and the other necessary information. This portal will also serve as a information hub regarding various softwares and databases that are available to be used by the public for free. We can even help students who are looking for short term projects using such huge volume of data by connecting with the scientists working actively in that area of research. Come join us on a journey which will take yopu the wonderful world of stars, galaxies and beyond; and feel enthralled by unlocking of the keys to the mysteries of the universe which the scientists are doing on a daily basis.

    "body": "2020/02/26 - Under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential that we finish what we start? If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out. If I ended a relationship with a woman who hit me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly secure route because my soul has other ideas, I am a flake? The truth is that no one else can definitively know the path we are here to walk. It’s tempting to listen—many of us long for the omnipotent other—but unless they are genuine psychic intuitives, they can’t know. All others can know is their own truth, and if they’ve actually done the work to excavate it, they will have the good sense to know that they cannot genuinely know anyone else’s. Only soul knows the path it is here to walk. Since you are the only one living in your temple, only you can know its scriptures and interpretive structure. At the heart of the struggle are two very different ideas of success—survival-driven and soul-driven. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others. Success is the absence of material suffering, the nourishing of the soul be damned. It is an odd and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world often resides in the hands of younger souls. Still working in the egoic and material realms, they love the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation. Older souls tend not to be as materially driven. They have already played the worldly game in previous lives and they search for more subtle shades of meaning in this one—authentication rather than accumulation. They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they really are the truest warriors. A soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our innate image. Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it.

Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end. It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life. "

Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original — which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother — is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.  It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”. The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. "

To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.  We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

If the existing directory isn’t empty, you can pass the –force option with jekyll new . –force.  jekyll new automatically initiates bundle install to install the dependencies required. (If you don’t want Bundler to install the gems, use jekyll new myblog --skip-bundle. ) By default, the Jekyll site installed by jekyll new uses a gem-based theme called Minima. With gem-based themes, some of the directories and files are stored in the theme-gem, hidden from your immediate view.  We recommend setting up Jekyll with a gem-based theme but if you want to start with a blank slate, use jekyll new myblog --blank To learn about other parameters you can include with jekyll new, type jekyll new --help.

From my earliest pebblehood the wildest things you could imagine have been happening to this world of ours, and I have been right in the midst of them. So begins Hallam Hawksworth’s The Strange Adventures of a Pebble. Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences. In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble: I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it. Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life.
