    "body": " What is CosmicVarta?Astronomy is truly a global subject. The boundaries between the nations, people, ethnicities do not exist for astonomers. We all think of the entire humankind as one. Hence, it becomes necessary and a responsibility for profesional astronomers to present a platform where the authentic research being carried out is presented and discussed in language which a ‘non-expert’ individual can understand. Moreover, while high quality research is communicated through the reputed journals, the students who are not dealing with he subject on a day to day basis might find it diiffuciut to grasp. We thought over this problem and came up with CosmicVarta as an online platform where we simplify the current astronomical research being carried out so that people from every background can grasp the essence of the results. CosmicVarta is intended to be a portal where the current research is presented ina simplified way and subsequently discussed by people so that everyone can have a glimpse into the excitng world of astronomical research. Through this portal, we will present reviews of recently published articles, interviews with the eminent scientists working in the field of astornomy and astrophysics all over India and also serve as a platofmr to discuss the research in a simplied manner. Research in astronomy is pursued at only a handful of research insitututes, hence prospective students may often find it challenging to find relevant information. Through this portal you may find information regarding the various career options available, various positions available at astronomy institues in india and the other related information. This portal will also serve as a information hub regarding various softwares and databases that are available to be used by the public for free. We can even help students who are looking for short term projects using such huge volume of data by connecting with the scientists working actively in that area of research. Come join us on a journey which will take you the wonderful world of stars, galaxies and beyond; and feel enthralled by unlocking of the keys to the mysteries of the universe which the scientists are doing on a daily basis. Who are we?We are a group of enthusiastic young researchers, mostly PhD scholars in astrophysics, who wish to make available lndian astronomy research to all interested minds. We keep a track of recent research papers published by lndian astronomers. Their works are written in simple language and published for others to read, understand, enjoy and perhaps motivate them to pursue astronomy research in the future. Allow us to introduce ourselves :)   Anusha R: Im Anusha. I’m currently working as a research project assistant at CHRIST (Deemed to be University). My research mainly focus on emission-line stars in general relating line properties, formation mechanism, statistical analysis depending on stellar parameters and the circumstellar environment, their disk physics. I am currently working on spectroscopic analysis of Disk forming hot stars and photometric analysis of the effect of binarity on the disk properties. Personally, I like to watch crime thrillers a lot. I’m a classical dancer and love to write.   Gourav Banerjee: I am Gourav Banerjee, pursuing PhD in stellar astrophysics at the Christ (Deemed to be University). My area of research is stellar spectroscopy, especially observational studies of emission-line stars such as Classical Be (CBe) and Classical Ae (CAe) stars. My PhD thesis aims to study (using optical spectroscopy) the variability (both transient nature and V/R variability) of selected CBe stars and also understanding the disc parameters of Galactic field CBe stars as a continuation of my MPhil thesis. Moreover, I have remained involved with other projects on similar fields such as the first systematic study to identify and characterize CAe stars (paper published in MNRAS), identification and characterization of CBe stars in open clusters older than 100 Myr (paper circulated), first ever identification of emission-line stars in transition between PMS &amp; MS phase (paper circulated), etc. Astronomy outreach is anothe field which I love from my heart. I am associated with astronomy outreach activities across Bengal and other parts of India for the past 26 years. My hobbies are reading books (mostly Bengali literature, history, and popular science) and exploring remotest places of India and abroad (sadly that is halted now).  And yes, I am a Voracious EATER. . food and books give me pleasure, astronomy provides me mental peace.   Ketan Rikame: I am a PhD student at Christ (Deemed to be University). Field of Instrumentation has always fascinated me and it has been my primary research interest. However, while working with various astronomy instruments, I also got interested in learning about underlying physical phenomenon these instruments try to study. I have previously worked in optical and radio instrumentation. I am currently part of the instrumentation team at RRI and we are building an X-ray polarimeter approved to be launched on a ISRO’s dedicated satellite mission XPOSAT. I also study accretion powered pulsars which will be one of primary scientific target of our X-RAY polarimeter. I am very much interested in science popularization. Although not involved in any such activity right now, I love to talk to people about my research (and not bore them hopefully :sweat_smile:). I also love to listen/read about to fascinating research other researchers are doing. I also love football :soccer:.   Lakshitha Nama: Hello. My name is Lakshitha Nama. I am a PhD student at Christ (Deemed to be University). My PhD research aims at understanding the relationship between magnetic field and the elemental abundances in the outer atmosphere of Sun and other main sequence stars. I make use of imaging and spectroscopic data from X-ray telescopes. My hobbies including reading and painting.   Vivek Kumar Jha: Hi everyone. I am Vivek. I am a Ph. D student at ARIES, Nainital. My research so far has been about understanding the inner regions of active galaxies.  My PhD thesis is aimed at resolving the inner (sub-parsec) regions of these objects through multi-band observations and infer the structure and kinematics of matter in those locations.  I am also interested in exploring the various all-sky surveys which provide huge amounts of data to be accessed publicly. When not doing research, I usually go trekking in the neighbouring mountains or spend some time listening to classical music.

We intend to use this page for linking the various institutions, where one can find the positions available (maybe news kind of thing), as well as the general entry procedures. How to pursue a career in astrophysics?: Well astrophysics is an exciting branch of physics isn’t it? There are plenty of options available for young people willing to choose a career in this discipline. While in India, there is not much emphasis on astrophysic as a subjet right until you gradaute, wide variety of options open up after it. During M Sc. some universities offering M Sc. in physics, have the choieof astrophysics as a specialization. Some universities even have a M Sc. n astronomy course (Osmania). But people hve an option of joiing the arous institutes for their dissertatio project. Places like IIA, IUCAA, ARIES etc. offer people the opportuity to conduct short terms projects in associations with a faculty mmber. After M Sc, if on is interested, one can apply for a Ph. D in this various institutes. A Ph. D is the highest academic degre one can obtan and from hereon the formal work of an astrophysicist starts. Want to pursue a Ph. D in astronomy in India?: If, yes this is the right place to seek the information aout these things. We list all the institutes offering a Ph. D in aatrophysics in India. ARIES, Nainital: Situated adjacent to the picturesque hill town of Nainital, ARIES (an acronym of Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences) is one of the leading research Institutes which specializes in observational Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics and Atmospheric Sciences. The main research interests of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics division are in solar, planetary, stellar, galactic and extra-galactic astronomy including stellar variabilities, X-ray binaries, star clusters, nearby galaxies, quasars, and inherently transient events like supernovae and highly energetic Gamma Ray Bursts. Research focus in Atmospheric Sciences division is mainly in the lower part of the atmosphere and covers the studies on aerosols and trace gases. Moreover, to strengthen the scientific contribution, the Institute has extended its horizon to theoretical and numerical studies in Relativistic Astrophysics. The unique position of ARIES (79° East), places it at almost in the middle of 180° wide longitude band, between Canary Island (20° West) and Eastern Australia (157° East), and therefore complements observations which might not be possible from either of these two places. ARIES has made unique contribution from time to time. The Institute hosts three telescopes of apertures 104-cm, 130-cm and 3. 6-mDOT. There is a 15-cm telescopes dedicated for solar observations. The 104-cm optical telescope is being used as a main observing facility by the ARIES scientists since 1972. It is equipped with 2k x 2k, and 1k x 1k liquid N cooled CCD cameras, fast photometer, spectrophotometer, and standard astronomical 2 filters. The telescope uses a SBIG ST-4 camera for auto-guiding through an auxiliary 20-cm telescope. In order to carry out observations in the frontier areas of astronomy, the Institute has installed 130-cm and 360-cm optical telescopes at a site called ‘Devasthal’ at a distance of ~ 60-Km from ARIES, which has the advantages of having dark skies and excellent observing conditions. The Scientists from the Solar group of ARIES are also participating in the national projects like space coronagraph and National Large Solar Telescope (NLST). There are different instruments for observation of physical and optical properties of aerosols and trace gas. An 84-cm micro-pulse LIDAR system for high altitude studies of aerosols and a ST Radar (Stratosphere Troposphere Radar) to measure winds speed up to an altitude of around 20 km is also being setup. More information about the institute is available here IUCAA, Pune: The Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) is an autonomous institution set up by the University Grants Commission (UGC) of India to promote the nucleation and growth of active groups in astronomy and astrophysics at Indian universities. IUCAA aims to be a centre of excellence within the university sector for teaching, research and development in astronomy and astrophysics. IUCAA’s activities fall under two broad programmes: core academic programmes and visitor academic programmes. Core academic programmes include basic research, the PhD programme, advanced research workshops and schools, the giant metre-wave radio telescope and guest observer programmes. Visitor academic programmes include the visitor and associates programme, refresher courses for teachers and helping the nucleation and growth of astronomy and astrophysics at Indian universities. More information about IUCAA is available here IIA Bangalore: The Indian Institute of Astrophysics is a premier institute devoted to research in astronomy, astrophysics and related physics. It traces its origins back to an observatory set up in 1786 at Madras which from the year 1792 began to formally function at its Nungambakkam premises as the Madras Observatory. In 1899, the observatory moved to Kodaikanal. In the year 1971, the Kodaikanal Observatory became an autonomous society, the Indian Institute of Astrophysics. The headquarters were shifted to Bengaluru into its present campus in Koramangala in 1975. Today, funded by the Department of Science and Technology, the Institute ranks as a premier institution devoted to research and education of astronomy and physics in the country. The main observing facilities of the Institute are located at Kodaikanal, Kavalur,Gauribidanur and Hanle. The Kodaikanal Observatory has for over a century been the principal centre of activity in observational solar and atmospheric physics. The Vainu Bappu Observatory at Kavalur has been the main optical observatory of the Institute for nighttime astronomy since the late 1960s. There are several telescopes in operation here, the foremost among these being the 2. 34 metre Vainu Bappu Telescope. The Gauribidanur Radio Observatory has a decametre wave radio telescope array and a radioheliograph. The new high altitude Indian Astronomical Observatory (IAO) at Hanle in south-eastern Ladakh has augmented the facilities for nighttime astronomy. Here, a 2 metre Himalayan Chandra Telescope has been installed in 2001. A seven-unit High Altitude Gamma Ray (HAGAR) telescope is in operation at the Hanle site. The Bengaluru campus has an extensive library, a computer centre, physics laboratories and electronics, photonics and mechanical laboratories supporting an active instruments development programme. More information about the institute is available here PRL Ahmedabad. : The Research in the Astronomy and Astrophysics Division involves investigations in the optical, infrared, X-ray and the radio wavelength bands to understand some of the outstanding problems related to galactic and extragalactic cosmic phenomena, such as star formation, stellar evolution, interstellar medium, binary stars, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and giant radio galaxies.

IIST, TVM: Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST), situated at Thiruvananthapuram is a Deemed to be University under Section 3 of the UGC Act 1956. IIST functions as an autonomous body under the Department of Space, Government of India. The idea of such an institute was mooted keeping in mind the need for high quality manpower for the Indian Space Research Organization, one of world’s leading scientific organizations engaged in space research and space applications. The institute is the first of its kind in the country, to offer high quality education at the undergraduate, graduate, doctoral and post-doctoral levels on areas with special focus to space sciences, space technology and space applications. IIST was formally inaugurated on 14 September 2007 by Dr. G. Madhavan Nair, the then Chairman, ISRO and was temporarily housed in the premises of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, very close from where ISRO built and launched its first rocket. Both the founding fathers of the institute, Dr G Madhavan Nair and Dr B. N. Suresh, the latter being the first Director of IIST, played a very important role in the formation of the institute, facilitating its establishment and contributing to its vision. Dr B. N. Suresh piloted the institute from the conception of the idea to its realization in a permanent campus near Thiruvananthapuram in 2010. The institute had the enviable reputation among all educational institutions since it had Dr A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, the renowned technocrat and former President of India as its very first Chancellor. Prof U. R. Rao, the eminent space scientist and one of the former Chairman, ISRO guided the institute as its second Chancellor with distinction for two years from 2015 to 2017. Dr B. N. Suresh, the founder Director of IIST has assumed charge as the institute’s third Chancellor since November 2017. Under the guidance of Dr. K Radhakrishnan and Shri A. S. Kiran Kumar (former Secretaries DoS / Chairman ISRO) as Chairman, Board of Management, IIST and Chairman, Governing Council, IIST, respectively, the previous Director, Dr. K. S. Dasgupta led the institute to achieve its mission of creating a unique learning environment enriched by the challenges of the Space exploration, by nurturing the spirit of innovation and creativity. IIST was judged as the eighth ranked University among all Deemed Universities in 2016 in the first National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) by MHRD. Dr K Sivan has assumed charge as Secretary, DoS in January 2018 and IIST is looking forward to Dr Sivan and the present Director Dr V. K. Dadhwal to take the institute to the next higher level of excellence. In the year 2017, IIST was ranked 28th among all engineering institutes, 35th among all universities and 56th overall among all institutions by MHRD in its second NIRF ranking.

    "title": "Deciphering The Mysteries of The Quiet Sun Explosions",
    "body": "2021/08/17 - The outer atmosphere (the corona) of the Sun poses a long standing mystery regarding its tem-perature.  The solar corona is composed of plasma (ionised gas) that emits strongly in X-rays andultraviolet radiation.  Its temperature exceeds a million degree kelvin, while the visible surface (thephotosphere) is at 6000K.  One of the theories to understand the so-called ’coronal heating prob-lem’ proposes the occurrence of a large number of small scale explosions (known as microflares andnanoflares) on the Sun.  It is known that these flares are a manifestation of the magnetic field of theSun that is generated in its interior.  Fig. 1 - Caption to this image can be used like this But the Sun’s magnetic field is not constant, it varies with anaverage period of 11 years, which is known as the solar cycle.  Approximately every 11 years, the Sun’smagnetic field reverses.  In other words, the north pole becomes the south pole, and vice versa.  The flip of the poles is an end product of the slow evolution of Sun’s magnetic field over time.  As the cycle progresses, all of the Sun’s activities related to its magnetic field (such as sunspots, flares, coronalmass ejections) builds to a maximum (when the magnetic field reverses).  Then the Sun settles backdown to a minimum, before the whole cycle starts again.  The Sun was in a very low state of activityduring the minima of solar cycle 24 covering the year 2019.  It was in fact the quietest the Sun has been in the last 100 years! During this quiet period of the Sun, at the mid of the year 2019, Chandrayaan 2 was launchedwith the several instruments/payloads to observed our moon and the Sun.  Among them CLASS is aninstrument to understand the abundance of elements present on the moon. But this requires knowledgeof the X-rays emitted from the Sun.  Thus, the orbiter also carried an instrument called Solar X-rayMonitor (XSM). XSM observed the Sun during its deepest minima of solar cycle 24, covering the year2019-2020 with a good temporal and energy resolution.  Using observations during this time, SantoshVadawale and his team has uncovered some fascinating information about the quiescent Sun.  Theyhave shown that during this period small scale transients, so-called microflares (smaller counterpartof the conventional solar flares) are occurring everywhere on the solar disk. Solar flares are eruptions of electromagnetic radiation of all wavelengths from the Sun.  They lastfrom a few minutes to a few hours.  Flares are classified depending on the energy they release during its peak in the soft X rays.  Though the number of large flares increase with the progress of thesolar cycle, this study suggested that small flares, called microflares, keep exploding on the Sun at alltimes.  Though the definition of microflares has varied though the years due to the sensitivity of theinstrument, in this study flares having a peak flux below 10−8W m−2are considered as microflares. During this period of extremely quiet solar corona when no active regions were present on the disk,Santosh Vadawale and team identified a total of 98 microflares from 76 days.  The microflares aremarked in the lightcurve (Figure 1).  Most of the microflares were seen to behave similar to largerflares having a fast rise and a slow decay.  Some microflares did not follow this behaviour possibly1due to blending of multiple microflares or they intrinsically have a different origin.  The temperatureand emission measure of these microflares are determined.  Temperature tells how hot the plasma getsduring the explosion while the emission measure gives an idea about the density of plasma emittedat that particular temperature.  The temperature is found to be between 3-6 MK and the emission measure is in the order of 1046cm−3. The XSM microflare locations are identified in the extreme ultraviolet images obtained fromNASA’s ‘Solar Dynamics Observatory’ and from the X-ray images obtained by the Japanese HINODEX-ray Telescope. Most microflares were seen to be associated with X-ray Bright Points. ‘Solar Dynam-ics Observatory’ HMI magnetograms were used to analyse the corresponding photospheric magneticfield.  They observed the microflares to be associated with magnetic bipolar regions having weakerfield strengths, which indicates magnetic reconnection happening at smaller scales (Figure 2). This is also the first statistical survey of X-ray microflares outside active regions.  By plotting thefrequency distribution of microflares, the team has given evidence for the hypothesis that small scaleheating events occur everywhere on the Sun and they contribute to coronal heating.

The boundaries between the nations, people, ethnicities do not exist for astonomers. We all think of the entire humankind as one. However, India is a country where astronomy is equated wih astrology by even the well educated individuals. This itself is a paradox, as the Indian civilsation has a rich history of astronomical observations and calculations (expand). It becomes necessary and a responsibility for profesional astronomers to present a platform where the authentic research being carried out is presented and discussed in language which a ‘non-expert’ individual can understand. Moreover, while high quality research is communicated through the reputed journals, the students who are not dealng with he subject on a day to day basis might find it diiffuciut to grasp. We present CosmicVarta as an online platform where we simplify the current astronomical research being carried out so that people from every background can grasp the essence of the results. We are a group of Ph. D students, who all are working towards our doctoral thesis and through this platform, we want to share the astronomical research being carried out by the Indian astronomers scattered all over the country. Another area where we’d like the users to utilize this platfomr is: career guidance in astronomy. Research in astronomy is pursued at only a handful of research insitututes, hence prospective studens may often find it challenging to find relevant information. Through this portal you may find information regarding the various career optiona available, various positions available at astronomy institues in india and the other necessary information. This portal will also serve as a information hub regarding various softwares and databases that are available to be used by the public for free. We can even help students who are looking for short term projects using such huge volume of data by connecting with the scientists working actively in that area of research. Come join us on a journey which will take you the wonderful world of stars, galaxies and beyond; and feel enthralled by unlocking of the keys to the mysteries of the universe which the scientists are doing on a daily basis.

    "body": "2020/02/26 - Under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential that we finish what we start? If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out. If I ended a relationship with a woman who hit me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly secure route because my soul has other ideas, I am a flake? The truth is that no one else can definitively know the path we are here to walk. It’s tempting to listen—many of us long for the omnipotent other—but unless they are genuine psychic intuitives, they can’t know. All others can know is their own truth, and if they’ve actually done the work to excavate it, they will have the good sense to know that they cannot genuinely know anyone else’s. Only soul knows the path it is here to walk. Since you are the only one living in your temple, only you can know its scriptures and interpretive structure. At the heart of the struggle are two very different ideas of success—survival-driven and soul-driven. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others. Success is the absence of material suffering, the nourishing of the soul be damned. It is an odd and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world often resides in the hands of younger souls. Still working in the egoic and material realms, they love the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation. Older souls tend not to be as materially driven. They have already played the worldly game in previous lives and they search for more subtle shades of meaning in this one—authentication rather than accumulation. They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they really are the truest warriors. A soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our innate image. Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it.

Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.

Here are some additional details: bundler is a gem that manages other Ruby gems. It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires. The Gemfile and Gemfile. lock files inform Bundler about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit bundle exec and just run jekyll serve. When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile. lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts. For more information about how to use Bundler in your Jekyll project, this tutorial should provide answers to the most common questions and explain how to get up and running quickly. "

Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end. It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life. "

Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.  We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically.

From my earliest pebblehood the wildest things you could imagine have been happening to this world of ours, and I have been right in the midst of them. So begins Hallam Hawksworth’s The Strange Adventures of a Pebble. Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences. In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble: I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it. Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life.
