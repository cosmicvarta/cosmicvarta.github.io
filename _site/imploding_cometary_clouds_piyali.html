<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>The region in between the stars is called the interstellar medium which is mainly composed of clouds of gas and dust. In interstellar clouds, starlight cannot pass through the highly dense area, which is why hydrogen can preserve its molecular state (H<sub>2</sub>). Also, other chemical elements, for example, carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), water (H<sub>2</sub>O), etc. exist in the form of molecules. Therefore, high-density interstellar clouds are called molecular clouds. Typically, the molecular clouds have an average density of 100-300 molecules cm<sup>-3</sup>. These molecular clouds are considered to be the potential sites of birth of young stellar objects (YSOs), through collapse under the influence of gravitational force, which tends to drive the cloud material inward towards the center of gravity.</p>

<p>Massive OB stars (Mass &gt;= 8M<sub>sun</sub>, with spectral types O and B) are considered to affect their surrounding molecular clouds significantly. The energetic photons emitted from these massive stars promptly ionize the immediate vicinities, resulting in a shock which eventually results in non-uniform cloud structures, such as Bright-Rimmed Clouds (BRCs), Cometary Globules (CGs), the Elephant’s Trunk Nebula, etc (examples are shown in Figure 1) based on their appearances. BRCs consist of a compact, dusty edge similar to a narrow, bright-rimmed head along with a faint elongated tail-like structure extending from the head, which is towards the side of the nearby massive OB stars. Many of the BRCs display more collimated structure, looking like a comet, which are named as CGs. Also, we can see elongated structures resembling an elephant’s head and trunk, which are designated as Elephant’s Trunk Nebula. Despite their structures, these clouds are invariably aligned with their long axes almost parallel to the direction of the ionizing sources, for example, nearby OB stars.</p>

</p>

<p>The shocks taking place in these cloud structures can trigger the star formation, by possibly compressing the inner dense cores and eventually tend to gravitational collapse. The evolution of these elongated molecular clouds and the star formation in them are found to be regulated by the orientation and strength of the ambient magnetic fields. An initially perpendicular magnetic field of weak and medium strengths is dragged and made to orient following the cloud structure during the dynamical evolution of the globule by the photoionizing radiation from the nearby ionizing source (see Figure 2). However, a strong perpendicular field remains in its initial alignment. Therefore, an investigation of the magnetic field geometry surrounding the molecular clouds is important to study the structures and the dynamics of the globules. Polarimetry (a tool to measure the polarization of the electromagnetic wave, e.g., starlight) is a great tool that is widely used to investigate the magnetic field structure projected on the plane-of-sky (B<sub>POS</sub>) around the molecular clouds.</p>

<h1 id="the-source-studied-in-this-work">The source studied in this work</h1>

<p>We focused on a CG named L1616, that resides at an angular distance of about 8<sup>◦</sup> west of the Orion OB1 associations, which is a group of massive OB stars at the Orion constellation. It shows evidence of ongoing star formation activity. An older population towards the north–eastern edge of the cloud (directed towards the Ori OB1 association) and a younger population towards the head region has been noticed, which means a trend of small-scale sequential star formation is present towards L1616. In Figure 3, we show the locations of L1616 and the nearby massive OB stars.</p>

<h1 id="results-and-discussion">Results and Discussion</h1>
<p>In order to study the B<sub>POS</sub> towards L1616, we carried out optical polarimetric observations of this cloud using ARIES IMaging POLarimeter (AIMPOL) attached with 104 cm Sampurnanand Telescope, located at Aryabhatta Research Institute of observational sciencES (ARIES), India <a href="https://www.aries.res.in/jeewan/Reprints/RautelaBS_2004_BASI_32_159.pdf">(see this link for details)</a>. In Figure 4, we show our optical polarimetric results. The orientation of the yellow polarization vectors indicates the angle of B<sub>POS</sub> from the celestial north (the point about which all the stars in the northern hemisphere are seen to revolve). A curvature in the B<sub>POS</sub> can be noticed in the head region of L1616. Also, the polarization vectors are found to show the trend of being twisted along the curvy tail. Overall, the B<sub>POS</sub> is found to be more chaotic in the head region, which might be a result of the disintegration of cloud material by the energy input from the associated young stars. The presence of the massive OB stars can also impact the B<sub>POS</sub>. From our results we conclude that possibly the ambient B<sub>POS</sub> had an initial alignment perpendicular to the major axis of L1616. This alignment might be dragged away from the source of ionization following the structure of the globule, resulting in the twist of B<sub>POS</sub> in the head area of the globule.</p>

<p>We have also made an attempt to investigate the pressure and the extent of the impact of the massive stars on L1616. The pressure exerted by epsilon Ori (the most massive star among the others in the Orion OB1 association) is estimated to be the highest, therefore epsilon Ori seems to be the main source to influence L1616. Also, the proper motion (motion of the objects projected on the sky plane) of the associated YSOs with respect to epsilon Ori shows evidence that most of them are moving away from the direction of epsilon Ori (main ionizing source). Based on the assumption that the motion of the YSOs follow the motion of the parental cloud, we can say that the cloud L1616 is currently being pushed away by the impact of epsilon Ori.</p>
