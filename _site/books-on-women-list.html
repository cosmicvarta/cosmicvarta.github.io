                <p><em>Progress is possible only when everyone capable of contributing is given an equal chance irrespective of gender, community and nationality. While there is a long way to go before this gap is fulfilled, it should be noted that we as a community have made considerable strides in meeting this agenda.

<hr />

<p>The science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in India, as is in every other country, have an unequal gender work environment. In this regard, the United Nations General Assembly has declared February 11 as the <strong>International Day of Women and Girls in Science</strong> to inspire and engage women and girls in STEM, with the hope that more girls take up science and research as a career.</p>

<p>While the number of women in science and technology is less, their contributions are not! In order to celebrate their contributions, we at <strong>CosmicVarta</strong> have collated a list of books that commemorate the immense contribution that women across the world have made to science with an intention to inspire and arouse a scientific temper in the reader. These books show us how these trailblazers, pioneers and path-breakers’ lives were and what inspired them to become scientists! This list is definitely not exhaustive and we hope that many more books will be written on the contemporary women scientists as well the future stars. Here is the list of books we have compiled:</p>

The sky is definitely not the limit for Indian women scientists. India became the first Asian country to reach Mars, in 2013, that too in its first attempt. This mission, among others, was led by a group of brilliant and dedicated women scientists of ISRO. This book narrates how these magnificent women overcame gender-barriers and succeeded to achieve the impossible!   </p>

Kalpana Chawla was the first woman of Indian origin to become an astronaut. Undeniably, she is an inspiration to millions of Indians, and not just women. Most school currilulum also have a chapter dedicated to this hero! While Kalpana Chawla died when returning from her second space flight on-board the space shuttle 'Columbia' in 2003, she is immortalized in this book.   </p>

Henrietta Leavitt measured star positions and sizes from photographs taken by the telescope at the Harvard College Observatory. Henrietta observed that certain stars had a fixed pattern to their changes which later made it possible for astronomers to measure distances, leading to our present understanding of the vast size of the universe. Henrietta's story makes a great inspirational read for young researchers!</p>

This is an extraordinary tale of a group of women who worked together and helped produce much of the data on which our understanding of the universe progressed during the 19th and 20th centuries. They carefully analyzed around half a million glass photographic plates which contained images of the universe taken from the Harvard telescopes. They helped discern what stars were made of, divided the stars into meaningful categories for further research, and found a way to measure distances across space by starlight.  </p>

" alt="Image 1" style="width:270px;height:350px;margin-right:15px;margin-bottom:20px;" />

The book narrates the unsung story of Mary Anning, a twelve year who discovered the first dinosaur skeleton--of an ichthyosaur--while fossil hunting on the cliffs of Lyme Regis, England. The inspiration behind popular tongue-twister "She Sells Sea Shells by the Seashore", she attracted the attention of fossil collectors and the scientific world alike. Her peculiar finds helped lay the groundwork for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, laid out in his On the Origin of Species. Darwin based Mary's fossilized creatures as irrefutable evidence that life in the past was nothing like life in the present. </p>

These are just few of the 'Headstrong' women who have been instrumental in major breakthroughs from the 17th to 19th centuries.

This illustrated biography narrates the story of Marie Tharp, a pioneering woman scientist and the first person to ever successfully map the ocean floor. Taught to think big by her father who was a cartographer, Marie wanted to map the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Despite failures and challenges where Marie would be turned away from a ship as having a woman on board was “bad luck”, Marie was determined to succeed. By mapping the ocean floor, Marie helped us better understand the planet we call home.</p>

The book presents the story of two women, Irène Curie and  Lise Meitner, who did ground breaking in a male-dominated field of science. Curie was denied admission to the French Academy of sciences due to her gender, even though she had been awarded with the Nobel Prize. Meitner’s unique insight was critical to the revolution in science that led to nuclear energy and the race to build the atom bomb, yet her achievement was left unrecognized by the Nobel committee.  </p>
